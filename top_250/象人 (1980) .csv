We are all moved different degrees by different things, but to witness sincerely nice people being treated cruelly always bothers me big- time....so this film is tough to watch in spots. Some scenes are just painful and depressing to view. ",/
1,19 December 2005,lee_eisenberg,10," An elephant never forgets, and ""The Elephant Man"" is unforgettable.","Anthony Hopkins is so associated with Hannibal Lecter, that we almost forget that he did star in movies before that. ""The Elephant Man"", for example. It's sort of hard to determine whether the main character is disfigured John Merrick (John Hurt) or Dr. Frederick Treves (Hopkins). Either way, it's the movie's plot that's important. The plot of course shows how Merrick has been treated as a monster all his life and Treves tries to cure him. As for the possibility that the movie may have revered its subject too much...well, would you feel comfortable mocking him? A particularly interesting combo is the people behind the movie: director David Lynch and executive producer Mel Brooks (Brooks' wife Anne Bancroft appears as an actress). The former is synonymous with deliberately weird cinema, while the latter is synonymous with silliness. Both men show a different side here. All in all, this is definitely a movie that everyone should see.",r
2,9 February 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10, The most moving masterpiece of all time!,"You have got to love the Elephant Man. There isn't one scene that doesn't move me. It is also underrated, as it is very difficult to find, and is hardly on TV. The cinematography was beautiful, and the subject matter about a doctor treating a heavily-disfigured man is so sensitively handled I felt I was there. One of the most moving scenes, was right at the beginning when Treves sees Merrick for the first time, and a tear rolls down his cheek.Extraordinary! The scene with Treve's wife is so sad that I had tears in my eyes for the rest of the movie. When he cries, ""I am not an animal, I am a human being,"" I was actually sobbing. i really was. The ending, with the lovely Adagio for Strings(the only time it has been played well) was so poignant, as was the scene in the theatre, with the Tchaikovsky-like music, and Merrick enjoying himself like a 6 year old boy. The music is very haunting, as made apparent in the crowd scene mocking Merrick in the hospital. Don't criticise the beginning, or the end, because David Lynch was trying to create images of pure sadness and inner beauty, and they were very powerful images. As for the performances, never have I seen Anthony Hopkins more sensitive than he was here(well except for the final scene of Shadowlands). His performance was actually one of the main reasons why this movie is so beautiful. The best performance, without a doubt, is the heart-rending performance of John Hurt as John Merrick. Almost unrecognisable, but so magnificent, especially when he recited the psalm without the help of Treves. It is also incredibly difficult to speak with a lopsided mouth, and John Hurt mastered it. Other notable performances are from Freddie Jones, Anne Bancroft, Michael Elphick and Sir John Gielgud. Anyone who gave this a 1/10, what is wrong with you? This is an absolute masterpiece, without question! 10/10. Bethany Cox",e
3,12 March 2003,george.schmidt,10, A Beautiful Mind,"THE ELEPHANT MAN (1980) **** John Hurt, Anthony Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, Wendy Hiller, Freddie Jones, John Gielgud.  David Lynch's masterpiece of the human spirit about the true-life account of John Merrick, a hideously deformed man in England's Victorian Age, who was taken in by a physician after a hellish stint in a freak show.  Hurt rises to the occasion and delivers a heart wrenching Oscar nominated performance emoting under tons of make-up to full effect.  Equally good is Hopkins in low-key form as the humanitarian doctor.  Beautiful black and white photography resonates the production; nominated for 8 Academy Awards including Lynch and Best Picture. Best scenes: Hurt's recital of the 23rd Psalm and his immortal line: ""I am not an animal, I am a human being!""  Incredibly powerful ending perfectly accentuated by the classical ""Adagio For Strings"".  Dare not to be moved. One of the best.   Trivia note, look for little person Kenny Baker during the carnival sequences; he's the guy inside R2-D2 in `Star Wars' and the head bandit in `Time Bandits'.",v
4,30 December 2005,rainking_es,10, Essential.,"There is no feeling, no virtue, no human baseness ""The Elephant Man"" doesn't scrutinize: hypocrisy, cruelty, mercy, sadism, love...). David Lynch reached the status of genius with his second movie, he created an instant classic for the history of cinema, a masterpiece. He probed his huge talent beyond the oniric or surrealistic fits of ""Eraserhead"" (and of most of his filmography). He probed he's capable of doing anything he wanted to with a camera on his hands. For those who think Lynch is just a pretentious guy which only films nonsenses, please take a look at this movie.",i
5,21 July 2001,Cheetah-6,10, Cuts Deep,"There have been many films made dealing with an individual who's outer appearance is completely at odds with their inner character. Some of these films are quite good but this is by far and away the very best. This is probably one of the most perfect films ever made. It succeeds on every level. Visually it transports one into a dark, grey, industrial nightmare of a world. It's within this world that we come to discover true beauty. It lies within one hideously deformed, abused and unfortunate soul who is being kicked around in this hellish existence. The screenplay, acting, direction all come together to create this extraordinary viewing experience. You really feel like you get inside this man and his tortured existence. The ending is one of the most effective and completely engrossing I've ever seen. Rarely does a film find a way to leave us with such a sense of closure and lingering fascination. The thing that really makes this film truly great is it changes the way people see themselves, other people and the world. I can still remember the palpable air of silence and awe over the audience when leaving the theater both times I saw it on the big screen. There's a transforming quality about it. You only need to read the many other user comments to see how people were moved and changed by this film. If you haven't seen it, it's a must!",e
6,22 December 2004,The_Void,8, A heartbreaking expose of society,"Nobody but Lynch could have directed this movie and made it the masterpiece that it is. Where other people would have gone for fake sentimentality and/or gruesome imagery; Lynch just presents the story how it is. The film is never gratuitous, and that is much to it's credit. It is, however, utterly repulsive. The black and white cinematography enforces this. There is nothing pleasant about The Elephant Man; it is as ugly as it's title character, and that is the way that this story needs to be. On the surface, it is ugly and repulsive; but just like it's title character; the movie has a hidden depth that is ultimately touching and heartbreaking. The movie sets itself up for this early on; the scene in which the Elephant Man is introduced is most of the most gut wrenching ever committed to film. As the doctor (Anthony Hopkins) sees the freak rise up and realises the extent of his deformity...a tear slowly form and rolls down his cheek. From this, you can see the pity that he feels for this man who has drawn the lot of a lowly circus freak; just from that one shot of a tear, David Lynch shows us the sorrow and the pity, and that's all he needs. Where some directors would have piled the sentimentality on, David Lynch is economic; that's all it needs, so that's all it gets. And that is the mark of a great director. Something that David Lynch most certainly is.",w
7,14 April 1999,coop-16,10, Ones of the most heart rending films of all time.,"It is truly baffling to me that there are people who have seen this film  who still think that David Lynch is a cold and cruel film-maker. David Lynch is ,in fact, a man of extraordinary gentleness and sensitivity, who cares deeply about the sort of people whom mainstream society stigmatizes as 'freaks'.Please, watch this film--watch it carefully-- and you will see that Lynch's deepest concern is with how a over-industrialized, rigid, and profoundly hypocritical society crushes its outsiders. It may sound odd, but I really believe that the non-Christian Lynch has, in the person of John Merrick portrayed one of the most profoundly moving ""Christ figures' in all of film.  Let me also note how well Lynch( In only his second effort at directing!) handled such legends as Hiller, Gielgud and Hopkins.",/

10,26 March 2005,shneur,10, A master work.,"There's always the inclination to say, ""My God, how could anyone go wrong with a cast like that?"" but of course the list of such disasters is long. This is one of those (few) movies about which, in my opinion, there's just nothing bad to say. The story is true, and John Hurt's incredible make-up corresponds very well to photographs of the real-life ""elephant man."" Hurt's interplay with Anthony Hopkins carries the film along on the evolution of their relationship from detached scientific fascination to enduring friendship. Ann Bancroft's performance is as masterful as one would hope and expect. The interviews included on the DVD were worth watching too, and will add to appreciation of the next viewing.",1
11,13 May 2015,Hey_Sweden,10," ""Touching"" doesn't begin to describe it.","This wonderful, heartrending drama stands tall as one of the finest hours for filmmaker David Lynch and actors Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt. Hopkins stars as Frederick Treves, an eminent surgeon in Victorian era London. While attending a carnival, he becomes aware of the existence of a sideshow attraction, John Merrick (John Hurt). Merricks' face is grotesquely distorted due to a congenital disease, and Treves's heart goes out to the poor man. He tries to give Merrick every comfort he can, and for the first time in Merricks' life, he's treated with respect and caring by people. Of course, there will still be those damnable individuals who merely seek to exploit Merrick for their own selfish reasons.",9

14,14 November 2014,brchthethird,10, An unabashedly sentimental masterpiece from David Lynch,"THE ELEPHANT MAN is a powerful and moving story with incredible performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. Based on a true story, the movie is about John Merrick, a horrifically deformed man who Anthony Hopkins' character (Frederick Treeves) finds as a sideshow freak in a carnival. Initially, he only displays him in a similar manner to his colleagues (he's a doctor), but after finding out that the man is intelligent he begins to care for him. The movie isn't quite easy to sit through, as you see the mental and physical abuse that John is put through. But for all the moments like that, there are many more touching moments that will put a smile on your face and/or a tear in your eye. I'll be honest, I cried on more than one occasion, and this has to be one of the most emotionally powerful movies I've ever seen. Family-friendly, has a great message and highly recommended for anyone.",7

16,26 January 2002,gethistr8,10, amazing....but not for the weak at heart,"this is a brilliantly done film.  it is quite raw and blunt about its subject matter, however, so it should not be viewed for ""entertainment"" purposes, thought he story is inherently intriguing.  we must just sit and watch in curiousity and amazement, but in concurrence with extreme sorrow, as we are shown the brutality that john merrick must face as his reality.  a smile from another human being, or even a pleasant greeting (which is something that we all take for granted), is treated by this man as the highest form of complimentary behavior possible.",4
17,9 August 2021,Galina_movie_fan,10, A true story of courage and human dignity,"This must be one of the most beautiful, cleansing, surreal tear-jerkers ever made. The fact that The Elephant Man(1980) was directed by David Lynch and produced by Mel Brooks and his company makes it even more surreal and incredible. It may seem over-sentimental and manipulative for some viewers but it is a great movie about the unbearable, unfair human condition, about dignity and what it means to be a Human Being, a Man. David Lynch's only second feature treats its subject with compassion and restraint and features outstanding performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. B/W cinematography that brought to life the feeling of expressionistic movies from the 1920s is appropriately disturbing. And who can forget the make-up work by Christopher Tucker! It took John Hurt seven hours every day to apply it and two hours to take it off.",/

19,20 April 2002,AdFin,10," ""The stream flows, the wind blows, the cloud fleets, the heart beats... Nothing will die""","Never could one hope to find a film as ugly and beautiful as David Lynch's film biography of John Merrick (The Elephant Man).  Merrick's story is perhaps one of the most heartbreaking and appalling cases of human injustice to those different, with a strong message, which still holds importance to this day.  In the hands of a lesser talented director this film may have been just another pointless Hollywood story, but in the hands of Lynch the film becomes a haunting, beautiful, but at the same time, highly disturbing work of art.  Always surrealistic in its storytelling approach, the film sets up Merrick's complicated birth with an abstract dream/flash back sequence, dimly lit and photographed in gloriously grainy black and white the audience can't help but be immediately drawn in to the story.",r
20,2 July 2014,g-bodyl,9, Keep The Tissues Handy!,"The Elephant Man is truly a moving story that is earnest and throughout the film, it makes the point that humans are not animals, no matter the dysfunctions or handicaps. In the case of John Merrick, he is revolting to look at because of an terrible accident, but he makes clear to all the people wanting to use him or gape at him, he is a human just like the rest of them. No matter who you are, it will be impossible not to cry at some point. That's how emotionally-affecting this film is.",e

The great humanity of David Lynch and the producers has left us with an equally frightening and endearing vision of Mr. Merick.",f
22,6 September 2009,Movie_Muse_Reviews,10, Fascinating story exploring humanity through a rare example,"""Looks are deceiving"" would be an adequate way to describe the ""The Elephant Man"" as a film from the outside, but it would be a horribly amateur way to describe its message. David Lynch's film soars beyond mere pity for those with life-altering physical abnormalities and serves as more than just a slap on the wrist to a generally unsympathetic public. It is a study of the human condition and Lynch's camera a microscope examining one of its most fragile examples.",_
23,10 May 2004,mhs_njrotc2004,10," A Masterpiece, Truly Remarkable","David Lynch is a remarkable director and The Elephant Man is a remarkable film. Inspired by a true story in the streets of London during the Victorian Age, the film is based entirely around the life of John Merrick (John Hurt), an individual dubbed by his `owner' Bytes (Freddie Jones) and others as 'The Elephant Man' because of his hideous deformities. With this film, Lynch grasps his audience and stretches them to a new parallel of an emotionally capturing film. And what makes this so daunting and so intriguing is the fact that 'The Elephant Man' is a true story, no part of it is fictional. Anthony Hopkins plays Dr. Frederick Treves, the man who somewhat saves John from those who persecute him for being a freak, being a `monster.' A story of human triumph could never be so remarkable as that of The Elephant Man. Lynch takes The Elephant Man to a new level of technical aspiration with a dark, dank setting shot completely in black and white. This film is amazing and would undoubtedly be just okay any other way. The black and white adds to the story in a way that touches the audience much deeper and much more personal. Not to mention stunning performances and dialogue by all cast, `David Lynch's portrait of John 'The Elephant Man' Merrick stands as one of the best biographies on film.' Literary critic Leslie Fiedler maintains that freaks stir `both supernatural terror and natural sympathies' because they `challenge conventional boundaries between male and female, sexed and sexless, animal and human, large and small, self and other.' In this very interesting and moving film, we are challenged to clarify our values in regard to `very special people.' However, in one powerful scene of tension and curiosity, John Merrick screams out, `I am not an animal! I am a human being! I.am.a man!' This particular sequence, I believe, is incredible and it ties in with the whole focus of the film itself, human dignity and emotion. David Lynch is known for some pretty twisted films, and yet, The Elephant Man is not that twisted at all. Even though his audience views John Merrick as not the average person because of his medical condition, the story is cherished because of how it is put onto the big screen. Compared to his other films such as Blue Velvet and Eraserhead, The Elephant Man is more surreal in terms of what Lynch was going for. Lynch does a magnificent job in portraying his version of The Elephant Man, and many people along with critics alike agree. I can easily rate The Elephant Man with four stars because David Lynch deserves no less. The Elephant Man is a classic, a striking and devastating film depicting the account of John Merrick's search for a dignified and normal life. I would definitely recommend this film to those in search of a wonderful story about one man's conquest to a regular life. Dr. Treves' account with John not only presents him with respect and normalcy, but also takes him as far as an uplifting scene where upon John states `my life is full because I know I am loved.' With such an inspirational and true story, David Lynch puts on a film that should be loved by many, if not all.",=
24,5 April 2008,The_Centurion,10, Despite all the ugliness this is a film of absolute beauty.,"""The Elephant Man"" is overwhelming. Never before, not ever, have I been so emotionally moved by a figment of cinema, or piece of music, or any other work of man. To admit that is hard for me, but to neglect doing so would be to rob this film of what it is due. This is the most arousing cinematic accomplishment, perhaps, in the history of motion pictures.",t

30,5 December 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,9," A hard movie to watch, but a truly great one as well","I haven't read or heard anything about the story of Joseph Carey Merrick, aka John Merrick, aka The Elephant Man before seeing this movie, so I can't say if it's accurate or not. However, from everything I've heard, it seems to be as close to the original story as it can get. I hadn't seen any other films by David Lynch when I sat down to watch this, so I was quite excited to see if it really lived up to all the hype surrounding it. It does. The film is excellent and nearly perfect. However, there are small imperfections that pull it just below a perfect rating, but it's very close. The plot is very good, and the way we learn of The Elephant Man is great. The way Lynch builds up suspense for the first few minutes, luring us with the promise of seeing something bizarre. When that promise is not kept, we are only more interested in seeing this, this creature that they speak of. But Lynch drags this even further... in fact, we don't get a good look at The Elephant Man for the first half hour... and even then, it's just in a flash. From there, we slowly see more and more of him, but somehow we never manage to truly get used to him. This is brilliant directing from one of the best directors out there, because obviously he would lose effect should we ever actually get used to his looks. The acting is great. I don't think I found one single character to be poorly performed. However, those that stand out the most are definitely Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt. Hopkins is great as the doctor who is amazed at this new phenomenon and is instantly intrigued in the physique of this man. Hurt is astounding as John Merrick, The Elephant Man. He brings such an innocence and purity to his character that we can't help but feel sorry for this man, as he is treated horribly by the majority of those he meet or who see him. I didn't cry during this film, but it was more close than I thought possible. For a film that deals with such a delicate subject, it has no actual sap or sentimentality... only sadness. Pure sadness. Near the ending, there is a powerful scene that shows, in a non-preachy fashion, the point of the film; it is not his looks that make him an animal, if he ever was one... it was the reactions of other men. The ending is beautiful. No other way to put it. Simply beautiful. As for those small imperfections I mentioned... I can't quite put my finger on what it is, specifically, but it just seems like something was missing... maybe I just felt that the film was too sad, maybe it was that the few attempts at lightening the mood fell flat and seemed out of place... maybe I just wasn't prepared for this moving experience. I don't know. I am honestly not sure. But while I found this movie to be great, excellent even, I have to say that there are better films. Not far better, no... but slightly better. There are films where all of the elements come together more perfectly and create a better movie overall. This one is worth watching, though, and should be seen by anyone who feels they would benefit from it on a personal or emotional level. It's a masterpiece. I recommend this movie to anyone mature enough to understand it. Yes. There is no 'definite' group of people that will get more out of this film than any other... except those that are intelligent and mature enough to understand and appreciate it. If you are one of those, and you have not yet seen this movie, go out and get it. You won't regret it. 9/10",
31,29 July 2003,auberus,8, A baroque masterpiece,"""Elephant Man"" is the 6th movie from David Lynch and probably is most ""baroque"" work. Staged in Victorian England, directed in 1980 and shot in black and white. Elephant Man might very well be one of the most powerful movies in history so far... The film is based on the true story of John Merick, the Elephant Man. David Lynch adapted this story following a very basic/simple narrative construction, emerging the audience in part of the life of John Merick from the time when he gets noticed in a freak show by a British surgeon to the time...(well you'll find out by yourself). The interpretation of both Anthony Hopkins as the British surgeon, Dr. Frederick Treves and John Hurt as the Elephant Man, John Merick is ""mistakeless"". The ton is right from beginning to end. Not one dialog is overplayed or downplayed. Overall the actors deliver an amazing performance. Anne Bancroft (Mrs. Kendal) is acting so true, John Gielgud (Carr Gomm) is the archetype of the humanist gentleman and Freddie Jones (Bytes) is impersonating this pathetic drunk vile character to perfection. The picture itself is flawless and very well balanced: few close up, few traveling. Every camera technique serves only one purpose: telling the story. The black and white picture is the perfect fit and reinforces the 'baroque' like atmosphere as well as helps the audience focus on the feelings demonstrated by all actors. Feelings are really what make this 'quest for humanity' an exceptional cinematic experience. It is an 'initiatic journey'. We start with a descent in Horror, dehumanization and monstrosity; we climb back to decency and tolerance to eventually arrive at the door of 'humanism'. We need to remember that how we act is who we are. If we act like animals we are animals and if we act like human beings we in fact become human beings. In other words we are not human by essence but we become human through our actions. In this regards John Merick appears to be the human one among us...",
32,27 June 2010,erinmerle,7," Great Film-making, Problematic Treatment of John Merrick","Moralising narratives are at the heart of many ""outsider"" biopics as a means of exposing the flawed logic of a ""civilized"" yet inherently inhumane society. This approach is exemplified to the extreme in David Lynch's The Elephant Man. The famous biography of John Merrick is presented as a horror film in which the viewer is repeatedly subjected to scenes of violence against a helpless and cripplingly deformed man. Historical documentation reveals that Merrick indeed suffered a great many injustices but testament to his survival is his industriousness and independence, qualities not explored in the film. The intelligent and gentle nature of Merrick is emphasized not to explicate his strength of character but rather to expose the stupidity and brutality of his tormentors. Fictionalized abuses such as a kidnapping, a violent manager, and a psychopathic night-guard supplement an already grotesque vision of 19th century England as an era of absolute inhumanity. The industrial nightmare which is the basis of Lynch's earlier experimental film Eraserhead is recycled and juxtaposed with the world of etiquette and bourgeois finery of the self-righteous Victorian upper classes. The system of capitalism is exposed for its inability to acknowledge the worth of human life outside of productive capacity. Those without labour power are dehumanized and stripped of all dignity in order to survive, fuelling the prevalence of prostitution, child exploitation, and freak shows. The treatment of John Merrick in The Elephant Man is yet another exploitation of sorts as it reduces an extraordinary life to a moral tale. When Dr. Treves says, ""Mr.Bytes, I'm sorry but all you do is profit from another man's misery"", one has to wonder at the hypocrisy of a film which replicates the spectacle of the freak show and exaggerates victimization in order to drive home an unsubtle misanthropic narrative.",

I found myself simply unable to drag my eyes from the screen, but I wouldn't want to, anyway. The character of John Merrick (based on the real-life ""Elephant Man"" Joseph Carey Merrick), whilst initially repulsive to the eye, has an aura of beauty about him.

Whenever I watch this movie I appreciate that it was filmed in b&w, and I cry a bit. It always makes me consider what an unbelievably cruel god it must be to take an already difficult Victorian life, add to that poverty and abandonment, and add to that virulent tumors that misshape a man to this degree, insuring absolute cruelty from his society, and that he can never seek employment. It's why I always have a big ""No thank you"" for religion. But I'm astonished that David Lynch (!) didn't attempt more with the material than mere sentiment.

38,6 August 2020,schroederagustavo,10," A great, touching film","The Elephant Man is my favorite David Lynch movie. John Hurt, who plays John Merrick, is outstanding and more so for having to show so much emotion under such heavy makeup. And the makeup is amazing as well, having seen a picture of the real John Merrick, it is extremely similar. Anthony Hopkins is also really good in the movie. Although The Elephant Man does have some weird abstract dream-like sequences that are really characteristic of Lynch's films, this is probably the most straight film I've seen him direct, although I haven't seen all of his work. This is a very emotional movie, with some great messages. John could have been utterly resentful about life and because of the way he was treated he had every reason to do so. But he decided not to. He shows us that regardless of the circumstances of our birth and regardless of what happens to us in life, we still have the ability to choose our own attitude in the face of adversity.

It is a drama filled with true compassion that makes you think and draws you in with great cinematography and black and white film.  The story is about a deformed man (John Hurt in his best performance in incredible makeup) who gets some help after years of torture by a doctor (Sir Anthony Hopkins in a early and good performance).  Real emotion is evoked here and it works as it is one of the best Lynch films and the 1980's films.  Biggest surprise- film is produced by Mel Brooks and his Brooksfilms productions. A,
40,5 June 2005,nlsimo,10, Great,"This film is one of the greatest of all time. Hurt and Hopkins are excellent and the great Wendy Hillier and John Geilgud put in superb turns. The script is at once energetic,emotional and perfectly paced. Lynch's direction is also awesome. why did this film not win best picture? it is a trillion times better than ordinary people. Well done to Mel Brooks for producing such a beautiful film and having faith in the then relatively unheard of David Lynch. To me this is a crowning point in the careers of of Brooks,Lynch,Hurt, Hopkins,Hillier,Geilgud,Bancroft. A pure unadulterated masterpiece Brilliant",
41,27 November 2005,BeckyKmovieluver,10," ""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man!""... Amazingly Moving","Wow... I have just seen this movie and I have to say 'The Elephant Man' moved me more than anything else I have seen in a very long time. This is a real classic and in my opinion Anthony Hopkins best ever performance. Joseph Merrick (or as he is known as in the film John Merrick) was born severely disfigured due to an horrendous congenital disease that left 90% of his body covered in tumours. As he grew up his condition worsened and by the age of 21 he was making a living in freak shows where he was presented to the audience as 'The Elephant Man'! John Hurt's portrayal of 'The Elephant Man' is simply amazing, moving, compassionate and deeply romantic! Whilst Hopkins approaches Dr. Fredrick Treves with genuine insight into the potential for great kindness and strengh that human nature embraces, providing a startling and moving contrast to the majority of other characters in the film who approach John with contempt and malicious intent. The movie really highlights the plight of Merrick when Victorian society knew and understood very little about what they dubbed 'freaks of nature' and often approached such unfortunate individuals with a mixture fear and perverted joy. Even those supposedly more educated individuals have trouble accepting Merrick for who he is: an incredibly intelligent, sensitive, loving yet horribly oppressed human being. Claiming that ""a hospital is no place for circus animals"" yet as John himself summed it up so brilliantly ""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man!"" It's amazing how much one man can endure, physical beatings, mental torture, and terminal illness yet still survive to prove to the world that their soul remains intact. As the film progresses the audience get to see beyond Merricks physical deformity and recognise him for the beautiful human being that he really is! The ending is brilliant, subtle and yet highly emotional with the death of John Merrick peacefully in his sleep. Yet now he is no longer alone and as the last line of the film sums up so perfectly ""Nothing will die"". Joseph Merrick will never truly die. His memory remains intact for anyone who has ever seen this film or heard his story. Whenever anyone accepts someone who is different to themselves they are remembering his name in the best way they know how. We can all say we know the story of 'The Elephant Man' but the question we have to ask ourselves is can we simply say that facts and figures are the best way to remember this man by? Suerly remembering through the love he shared with those closest to him is the only way to go forward.",
42,29 September 2005,MovieAddict2016,10," A beautiful, strange, touching, bittersweet and ultimately haunting true story, well-told and respectful of Merrick without ""cheapening"" the tale.","Few films capture ""true stories"" as well as The Elephant Man. Although there were, of course, certain artistic liberties drawn (as with any film based on actual events), David Lynch respects Joseph Merrick enough not to present him as a monstrous caricature of a man. (You may be wondering why I do not refer to Joseph Merrick as John Merrick...well, his real name was actually Joseph, but was changed for the film as its screenplay was based on correspondence letters between Dr. Frederick Treves and Joseph. For some reason, he altered Joseph's name in the letters to ""John"" at some point in time. No one's sure why.) John/Joseph Merrick had a rare disease called Proteus Disease, a congenital condition. It made him appear hideously deformed and unrecognizable as a man.",

These are the heartbreaking words that John Merrick says when he gets fed up with people gawking at him and comparing him to an animal. David Lynch's The Elephant Man is a hard-hitting story about a real-life person who is an outcast due to his deformities. However, Lynch who also wrote the script, portrays this subject matter in a more positive light. Themes of courage, and the fact that everyone is human no matter the circumstances are brought to light here. Prepare to bring the tissues, because this story is an emotional story and I can guarantee no one will have a dry eye when the end credits appear on screen.",
44,24 September 2002,Evan Anderson,10, One of the greatest,"This was a truly great and touching movie.  It's hard to give a review because it really has to be seen to be believed.  Hopkins and Hurt are terrific.  This has to be one of the best by David Lynch and that's saying a lot considering the obsessed Lynch fan I am.  One of my friends have begged me to see it at a party but he and I were outvoted by Shining fans.  Anyway this movie will make you cry.  John Merrick may look like a monster but he is a caring, kind, intelligent, respectful, and above all great man.  It's the people that discriminate against him, ridicule him, and use him that are the monsters.  Several scenes in the movie can be rather disturbing (one is hard not to turn away from) but that's what makes this movie so powerful.  I don't see how anyone can put down this film and say it is not great.  Even if you hate David Lynch's other movies you'll probably still like this one. If it didn't win any of the eight academy awards it was nominated for it would have been an injustice.  You have to see it to believe it.  ",

46,12 January 2005,grahamsj3,9, Magnificent film,"This is a more or less true story, from what I understand. It is the sad story of a man named John Merrick who was horribly deformed by a disease. He spent a large part of his life as a circus or sideshow freak attraction. Shunned by nearly everybody, he was beaten and mistreated in nearly every imaginable way. Merrick is masterfully played by John Hurt. He is eventually discovered and rescued from that awful existence by a physician named Dr. Frederick Treves, played beautifully by Anthony Hopkins. The film deals partly with deformity but also partly with Merrick struggling to regain some sort of identity as a man instead of just a freak. Dr. Treves is a great ally. However, even as a man who can now move among an abbreviated clique of people, Merrick discovers that his disease is still a terrible affliction. That it was produced in black and white adds to the sad ambiance of the film and helps draw powerful emotions out. IMDb users have voted this film a spot in the top 250 films of all time and it certainly belongs to be in that company. This is Director David Lynch's finest work to date.

All the pieces come together here for one of the most bittersweet true stories ever put to film.  Anybody who thinks Lynch can't make a coherent and meaningful film need only look at this.  Horror and beauty are beautifully contrasted here and Lynch gets to the roots of our humanity.  One of the view films that made me cry.  A masterpiece.",

Right now it resides at the second spot on my Top 150 list. http://www.imdb.com/list/ls056382763/ In my opinion this is David Lynch's greatest work. I get called a Lynch fanboy quite often because of my fascination for almost all of his short films, television shows, feature films and even his music. But goddamn this man is a genius. A script and a story just waiting to be made into a Disney movie but put in the form of a dark twisted movie that still shows such happiness. Great acting from Anthony Hopkins, which is as to be expected but the performance from John Hurt, an actor who's filmography before 1979 is somewhat lackluster, is outstanding. He becomes John Merrick physically and emotionally and his performance is better than any I have ever viewed in a film.

It has several brilliant performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins, great art direction/editing/costume design and such, but there are three things that stand even farther out. The direction is just perfect. David Lynch manages to disturb us without making us stop caring for his characters. The screenplay is one of the greatest ever. It helps a lot in the area mentioned before disturbing us while making us care deeply about the characters. The original musical score is however the strongest point of the film.

53,24 August 2009,rowmorg,5, A Victorian morality yarn with a thin story and thick make-up,"Choosing monochrome for his foray into the smog age and Jack-The-Ripper back-street London, director David Lynch does everything to place his freak-show action far in the past. However, he is exploiting the Elephant Man (Hurt as John Merrick) no less than his ""owner"" was in the fairground. He offers no explanation for the man's condition, not even from the eminent surgeon Treves (Hopkins) who got the unfortunately deformed man admitted to the London Hospital. Apparently, plastic surgery was far in the future when Treves practised medicine. Not even a dental surgeon was able to sort out Merrick's mouth for him, it seems. Once this is established, the medical dimension is removed from the story and it shrinks into a little morality tale that can barely support a 90-minute feature. There's no sub-plot, for example, to change the tempo, and the civility of Merrick's entry into society is laboured while we wait for the janitor to bring in his paying crowd, along with the wretched, drunken 'owner', and wreck Merrick's life once again. Anne Bancroft's walk-on appearance as an improbable West End actress speaking American and doing a reading of the love scene from Romeo & Juliet is poorly handled as the story clunks along in ""and then"", ""and then"" mode. The Elephant Man is a rather tiresome and poorly constructed bio-pic that fails to transcend the age in which it is set, and succeeds only in making a banal point about the gulf between appearance and inner nature, something that Charles Dickens would have handled in one paragraph.",

57,13 July 2005,jboothmillard,10, The Elephant Man,"I remember seeing this during my time at college, and when I got the chance to see it again, that was when I realised what a masterpiece it truly is, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director David Lynch (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive). The film opens with a flashy scene seeing a (pregnant) woman being attacked by an elephant, before it moves to the main time of 19th Century, Victorian London, England. Dr. Frederick 'Freddie' Treves (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is exploring the urban carnival freak show, and he pays owner Bytes (Freddie Jones) for a private viewing of the most hideous of all of his ""creatures"", known only as 'The Elephant Man'. He pays him also to allow him to examine him for the Pathological Society, and after returning back to Bytes, being beaten severely and suffering bronchitis, Treves takes him back to be treated in the hospital. Knwoing his true name, John Merrick (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated John Hurt), Treves finds out slowly that he does not need to learn to speak, he is already able to read, write and speak already, he was just afraid. Merrick's tragic condition of deformity is caused by 14 overgrown tumours on his body, face and hands, and he can only sleep sitting up or he will die suffocating from the weight of his head. Most of the hospital staff, including Governor Carr Gomm (Sir John Gielgud) and matron Mothershead (Wendy Hiller), accept him being a permanent patient, and slowly Treves introduces John to London society. The starts with a meeting with Mrs. Treves (Hannah Gordon), and the local newspaper report allows John to meet famous stage actress Madge Kendal (Anne Bancroft). Then one night, the greedy Night porter (Michael Elphick) has many drunk people paying him to see the freak, and amongst the people is Bytes who kidnaps John taking him to France. So once again, sick and neglected, John is put on show as The Elephant Man, but Bytes' son (a very young Snatch's Dexter Fletcher) and the other carnival performers release him. John is happy to return to the safety of the hospital with Treves, and they both know John doesn't have long to live, so they go to the theatre where Mrs. Kendal dedicates the performance to him. The final scene sees John's finished castle model, before he discards all the pillows to sleep lying down where he dies and his Mother (Phoebe Nicholls) welcomes him into Heaven. Also starring Helen Ryan as Princess Alex and Star Wars' Kenny Baker (R2-D2) as Plumed Dwarf. With reliable and magnificent British talent like Hopkins, Bancroft and Gielgud you can't go wrong, but this film obviously belongs to the superb and unrecognisable (apart from the voice and eyes) Hurt. Lynch makes sure that this biographical drama pulls at all your heart strings, with the great atmospheric music, great special effects make-up, and even the black and white colour adds something, it is one of the only films I know that makes you feel sympathy for a (real) character the whole way through, that's what makes it a masterpiece. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Morris, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Production Design/Art Direction, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Sir Anthony Hopkins was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, John Hurt was number 27, and Hopkins number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Hopkins was also number 1 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 3 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers.

58,16 March 2023,I_Ailurophile,10," Exquisitely writte, crafted, and performed; a must-see classic","Even when dealing with straight drama, David Lynch has a curious knack for introducing a sense of the fantastical and otherworldly into his films. Nevermind dashes of outright surrealist imagery, or the subject matter: subtle touches like Freddie Francis' vivid, smart black and white cinematography, the director's particular, mindful orchestration of shots and scenes, and the vibrant, rich performances of the cast are the real source of that feeling of the extraordinary. The exquisite production design and art direction feed into it, as does the stirring, original music of John Morris. Before we even properly consider the core of 'The Elephant Man,' this is a very pleasing, rewarding experience. Consider the real-life story within, and it's no wonder that the film has been regraded so highly all in this time - this is a beautiful, warm, heartfelt piece that's as sad and tragic as it is inspiring and hopeful.

59,30 April 2010,Red-Barracuda,9," A heartbreaking and horrible story, beautifully told","Who could possibly have thought that the young director David Lynch would have made a film like The Elephant Man? The director's only previous feature film was the utterly bizarre Eraserhead. There are similarities or course – the grotesque subject matter, some surreal details and the black and white presentation – but it's the differences that are so incredible. Unlike Eraserhead, The Elephant Man is a character-driven biopic with a clear narrative and powerful emotional core. It has a string of world-class British actors and strong production values. It certainly seems like producer Mel Brooks took an incredibly risky gamble in his choice of director for this project. History has shown, however, that it was a gamble, to Brooks's eternal credit, that paid off handsomely. The young avant-garde director proved himself to be far more than a one-note merchant; he in fact showed that he was an artist of incredible skill, capable of not only astonishing experimental weirdness but also linear story-telling of the highest calibre.",
60,16 October 2007,moonspinner55,7," Somber, graceful, eloquent--if not always moving","Filmmaker David Lynch sees the beauty in misfits, whether it be a disfigured saint such as David Merrick in ""The Elephant Man"" or the bizarre carny folk who make up the traveling sideshows, though he shows no interest in plucking our heart-strings over them, or in being emotionally prodding. While this is often a big plus, Lynch's non-sentimental take on Merrick's story keeps the movie grounded when it should soar. True story of a horribly disfigured British man at the turn of the century who is rescued from a freak show by a sympathetic doctor is layered with a dreamy atmosphere but also anchored by serious, intelligent performances by John Hurt as Merrick and Anthony Hopkins. However, once Merrick is brought out into a curious high society, one feels that the director's dramatic resources have been tapped out, and the last act plays like an afterthought. Certainly this is a fine piece of cinema, adapted by Lynch and others from two books on Merrick; it is graceful and deliberately downbeat (appropriately so), though its technical finesse ultimately presses out the emotion. *** from ****",

Anthony Hopkins, who would rise to fame a decade later in the chilling 'The Silence of the Lambs,' is brilliant as Frederick Treves, a doctor who initially exploits Merrick's condition to advance his career, but inevitably falls in love with the man. Likewise, John Hurt is so perfect as John ""The Elephant Man"" Merrick that I feel I don't even need to express how good he was! The famous scene in which Merrick, unfairly cornered at a train station by a mob of angry men, desperately cries ""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man!"" is one of the great moments in cinema. I would consider this film to be absolutely perfect, but for the very end. As Merrick lays himself down on the bed, determined to sleep and die as a normal man, I would have been blissfully content with a brief pan to his mother's photograph, a pause of several seconds and a soft fade into black.

I was already a fan by the time THE ELEPHANT MAN saw release: I'd seen ERASERHEAD at several Midnight showings and had hunted down and seen on a college campus two of his shorts, THE ALPHABET and THE GRANDMOTHER. Going in, I was pretty sure I knew what to expect. I was wrong. Eschewing the surrealistic touches that made his previous endeavors so quintessentially quirky, he opted this time around to tell a straightforward tale of the Human Heart. ""Abominable things, these machines,"" Hopkins as Treves says when first we meet him, treating a burn victim: ""You can't reason with them."" In ERASERHEAD, the dark, industrial landscape through which Jack Nance as Henry moves is every bit as uncompromising as the Industrial England of Merrick's time. This integration of the Industrial with the Human would continue full blown in DUNE and, to a much lesser degree, in TWIN PEAKS- which boasted an ""industrial soundtrack."" David Cronenberg pioneered Biological Horror; Lynch, a type of Twisted Industrial Surrealism. (I wanted to see a Bernie Wrightson black and white comic book adaptation of THE ELEPHANT MAN, but, alas, 'twas not to be.)

78,21 February 2013,ironhorse_iv,9, Let's talk about the Elephant Man in the room,"'I'm not a animal, I'm a human being!' screams out John Merrick surrounded by a crowd looking at his face at the train station. One of the most powerful lines in movie history was born and it's just heartbreaking to watch. The onlookers, so stifled by the conformity of their Victorian age, gather around in their top hats and well trimmed mustaches for a rare glimpse of ""abnormality"" that evaded the circus, the hospital and the madhouse. The prudish judges of normality are still everywhere even today, judging by and how some people still look down on deformities. John Merrick was human, and not only that a truly great intelligent man. The movie starts out with London surgeon Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) discovers John Merrick (John Hurt) in at freak show where he is managed by a brutal man by the name of Bytes. Frederick Treves tries to help the man, with not only his condition, but also to escape from the exploitations of Bytes. On the way, Merrick is both love and look upon by the public. Merrick is so deformed to the point that he must wear a hood and cap when in public due to Merrick's most life-threatening deformity, his abnormally large skull, which compels him to sleep with his head resting upon his knees, as the weight of his skull would asphyxiate him if he were to ever lie down. John Merrick tries everything to try to be normal. He talks in a sophisticated and articulate matter, he appears at operas, does art, reads, makes model and every looking for true happiness. Directed by one of the greatest directors, David Lynch, the movie works in every level. The black and white gives the film, its serious tone, while also giving the film, it's creepiest. The dream like scenes are chilling reminds me of his work on 'Eraserhead'. As clichéd as it might sound, about an hour into the movie, I didn't even really notice Joseph's deformities. At first, I was somewhat intimidated, but after a while, I focused more on who he was as a person and David Lynch makes you see him more like a human being by giving him depth. It would have been an astonishing act if the writers decided to show the true reaction of complete submission and self degradation of the Elephant-Man. I think David Lynch could have easily directed this alternative twist as well. The music of the film is ground-breaking. Adagio for Strings by Samuel Barber or Andre Previn gives the movie, its tragedy ending, while the theme song composed by John Morris gives the film, it's haunting score. The Victorian sets are has never looked so convincing on screen, yet with that nightmarish quality that defines most of the movie. Anthony Hopkin are well-acted, but I have to give it to John Hurt, You could only see his eyes behind the layers of makeup, but those expressive eyes does a masterful job in creating a sympathetic character out of a man who is at first glance a monster. I think ""Elephant Man"" not getting an award lead to the creation of the annual award for best makeup. Prior, makeup awards were given rarely, I believe. Just on special occasions. But when ""Elephant Man"" didn't get any nods for it, people rightfully complained and the academy then created the annual makeup award the next year. Still, the movie has it faults, first off John Merrick is really Joseph Merrick in real life. Dr. Treves' reminiscences mistakenly names Joseph Merrick as John Merrick, an error widely recirculated by biographers of Merrick. The film was based on Treves memoirs, and in them he crosses out ''Joseph'' and writes in ''John'' above - hence the confusion. No one knows the reason for the ''deliberate mistake'', because everyone knew Joseph was called Joseph, plus its written on his birth certificate,and he signed his only surviving letter ''Joseph Merrick'. There are many things that did not actually happen in the movie. Such as the beatings from Tom Norman AKA Bytes who treated Joseph Merrick with great care and respect in reality. Why would they beat him if they are making a lot of money off of him? We are also to believe that Joseph's mother never did love him in the film, in true, he was rejected by his father and stepmother, not his mother. John suffered from a rare, degenerative and progressive disease (Proteus Syndrome, I believe), and Merrick told Norman that he no longer wanted to be examined at the hospital. According to Norman, he said he was ""stripped naked, and felt like an animal in a cattle market' by Treves. So there is a lot of information that is left out. Period films are hard to pull off convincingly and here we are plunged into this utterly alien world but the story is never depressing nor preachy. Still poignant , deep,﻿perfect illustration of human flaws and human kindness. Such a gentle soul filled with deep inner beauty and not a mean bone in his body despite all of the painful horrors inflicted on him by a so called civilized society. There is a lesson to be learned about the dignity this one of a kind man maintained in a world that judged him on the texture of his outward appearance such so that he went through life with his head held up high even when he was sleeping. Bless you Joseph Merrick your inner beauty trumped all.",

In the Victorian London he's a freak who's been used at carnivals for people to have a look at. One day Doctor Frederick Treves sees the man and decides to take care of him. John Merrick got a room in the local hospital but soon we'll see that the doctor invites all types of persons from the high society who want to see the freak, even if they all can cover it up like some tea-parties. Anyway, it looks like John Merrick got a sort of life in where he seeks the little pleasures of life. The real tragic is that there is a sort of battle going on who owns the freak, is it the freak show-owner or the doctor? What Lynch is showing us is to see who actually the freak is : the poor creature or the crowd who are so curious that they forgot there is actually a human being behind the tragic body?

Only the women in the film empathize with Merrick, they are the only ones that can truly understand him and love him.  The scene where Mrs. Treves breaks down after Merrick tells her about his own mother is simply beautiful.  You can read it all in her eyes, as she thinks about her own children and feels genuine empathy and love for Merrick.  Bancroft's reaction is also without judgment and is purely love, as is the nurse (even though she may have disdained him at first).  I beleive that this film gives one a deep insight into the female characters in Lynch's other productions and is necessary viewing before any attempt to understand his art can begin.",

That freshman effort is perhaps Lynch's most pure expression of cinematic artistry—a fiercely idiosyncratic, absurdly inscrutable gesture of audio/visual mischievous of the most masterful kind. Contained within Lynch's debut feature length movie can be found the bulk of the sublime ideas and ingenious cinematic techniques which infused all his later films with such shockingly vivid & visceral emotionalism. Eraserhead is such a powerfully effective bit of cinematic wizardry that upon witnessing it—no, upon being assaulted by it!—Mel Brooks was convinced that its mad genius creator had to be the director of the unusually odd film which he was producing, and thus David Lynch was hurled into the gaping, yawning, voracious orifice that is Hollywood film-making.

The audience is allowed or even forced to confront its own flaws, its numerous shortcomings. Yet the undertone is more often than not the one of hope, that we still have the chance to learn. Some could even claim that in some respect this film is educational. It certainly has a moral lesson. That pity rarely is the right answer, as it is nothing more than the grudging nod of a supposedly superior being towards a lesser man. Rather we should learn to respect and accepts others as equals, worthy of our time and their own individuality. It is a difficult lesson to teach without preaching or pointing fingers, but I rather think that this film accomplishes just that and it accomplishes it with beauty and grace.",

Abandoned by his mother, he became the slave of a vicious entrepreneur who lived by displaying him in a freak show.  He was rescued by a doctor (Anthony Hopkins) who wanted to study him.

The story is sad with the way John Merrick was treated and no one could have played him better than John Hurt. I believe Robert De Niro's performance in Raging Bull was superior and I am glad he won best actor. However, I believe the Elephant Man should have won best picture. The direction is great, I believe it was a great choice to film in black and white. I love the cast starring Anthony Hopkins, John hurt, and Anne Bancroft.

As the movie evolves, he becomes more than we think he will, actually attaining celebrity. But, like Eric Stoltz, in ""Mask,"" society is there to pull him back. He can't be what he wants to be, try as he might. There is rampant cruelty throughout the world and Merrick lived it every day. I know that Roger Ebert leveled a charge of manipulation and sentimentality against this film. This is probably true. Filmmakers can't seem to resist the rather trite emotional tricks at times. The fact that Merrick was rebuilt to some extent for the film may be worthy of criticism. Maybe they did him a disservice by making him a bit more palatable for the movie audience. I don't know. We create fictions in film all the time. If we have a cancer patient, should we show them with pustules braking on their bodies. Perhaps we should to create an accurate portrayal. Perhaps today, the Elephant Man may be more graphic, more difficult to look at. Perhaps that would make a better film. I just know that sentimentality aside, this is a pretty good one.",

It was nominated for eight Oscars, but did not win any of the categories. The director is David Lynch and if I say that this film is a contender for being his most famous work, then this means quite something with everything else he has worked on. The film is about the actually existing man John Merrick and this probably helped the movie as well with its awards ambitions. It is not the first and by far not the only time that Lynch directed a film based on actually existing people. ""The Straight Story"" comes to mind too for example. That was much later though. Lynch is also one of the three writers here, which is not unusual as he may not have worked on the screenplay for all his films, but for the majority it was the case that had did. For his two co-writers Bergren and De Vore, this is surely also the most known work of their career as it got them the Oscar nomination. And was just seen by so many. Still is in fact. The room was quite packed when I watched this movie the other day. I am glad it was and that old films like this are still getting the recognition. The thing you will recognize first perhaps from those over two hours is that this is a black-and-white movie and given the fact that it was shot in the late 1970s, it hadn't to be one of course, but it was definitely a stylistic choice from Lynch as the actual elephant man lived in the 19th century still, actually during the years when moviemaking pretty much began back then, even if Merrick had no connection to it and also wasn't filmed, but drawings and photographs exist apparently.

It may sound strange, for a director, wanting to make a movie about a so profound disgrace happened to a man, and maybe inappropriate, but the portrait furnished by David Lynch of this unusual gentleman is one of the most touching, deepest, yet most impressive figures the history of cinema has ever displayed. It's presented in a wonderful b/w photography which helps you get into the dramatic reality, into the sadness of its story. Anthony Hopkins is simply amazing in the role of doctor Frederick Treves, a man whose intents of study and knowledge of the strange disease he's witnessed will soon bring him so close to the very soul of the Elephant Man, and yet he's not really sure if he's acting in John's or in science' interest. The carachter impersonated by John Hurt has nothing to envy to the most tormented heroes of Tim Burton's flicks, but the actor's performance, his suffocated voice, and deep artistic sensitivity define his beautiful soul much more than his appearance.

In particular, there's apparently no evidence that Merrick ever met ""Mrs. Kendal"" (played by Ann Bancroft) although she did take quite an interest in his case.

Hopkins and Hurt gave the performances of a lifetime and played them with such passion and feeling.The movie broke my heart and broke it even more when I learned it was a true story! I was horrified when we first see John but then as we went deeper and realized what a kind, loving, and intelligent man he really was...wow. My favorite part had to be when he and Bancroft were doing Romeo and Juliet, although it was disappointing that Bancroft got so much credit for such a small part. Seeing John being treated so inhumanely infuriated me on so many levels and it's hard to watch those scenes without yelling at the screen. It also made me realize that there are still Elephant Men and Women in the world today and I hope they're not treated like John Merrick was. I sincerely hope we can all learn some- thing from John Merrick and Dr. Treves. Was he attractive to look at? No. Was he a wonderful human being? Absolutely. Watching him remove the pillows and quietly slip away made the tears start all over again. In all, this is a beautifully haunting movie that stays with you and makes you think! A definite must see!",

Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft play their roles with engaging sincerity - very ably supported by Sir John Gielgud and Dame Wendy Hiller. Prosthetics aside, John Hurt captures both the despair and optimism of Merrick with empathetic style; and Freddie Jones is just downright evil as ""Bytes"". His son Toby was at the screening and I couldn't help but wonder when he watched this portrayal by his father whether the pride in the performance must have been tempered by a disgust in the character, itself!! This film doesn't seem to do the rounds very often, nowadays, but it holds up very well after almost 40 years and is really a gem.",

What really was shocking was when he got kidnapped and was brought back to the circus again. Then of course, the most shocking part of the movie was when the gang with their women just tormented him by making fun of him and lying to him that they weren't gonna hurt him in which they were very much. I felt I just wanted to kick the hell out of Bytes gang and treat them on what they did to Merrick. It was deeply unfair and awful, I felt like I was going to cry because I just couldn't believe it!",

Frankly, I thought this movie might be childish. The film reveals that dark and evil side of humanity in its most naked form. Maybe the evolutionary structure of nature is about such bullying. Excluding the different is a fact that humanity lives in every period. I felt compelled to fast forward the movie while watching the scenes where John was tortured and bullied. I don't know how realistic the idea of sustainable goodness is, but encountering this evil side of humanity makes me hate my own self.

John Merrick is a mystery, shown first as an anonymous silhouette and revealed only in small doses. Many of the characters in the film are also visually represented as if they are menacing monsters themselves. The quiet soundscape adds to the constantly eerie feeling.

191,11 January 2006,missmarty,10, very interesting movie,"I appreciated this movie. It was a very moving story. The thing is that they don't show you John Merrick's face until about half-way through the movie. By this time, if you're like me, you've got all sorts of pictures and horrible images running through your head. But when he finally is shown, he's not that bad. He is deformed, and rather repulsive, but as the story goes on, you begin to warm up to him, and feel for him. I still cannot believe how cruel some of the people were in the story. It made me nearly cry. This movie is not for kids, as it shows the darker side of life. It has some startling images, and (if I'm remembering right) the part where the guys force Mr. Merrick to drink something, then pretty much murder him (I won't say how) was, for me, very hard to watch. THIS IS NOT A COMEDY OR LIGHT-HEARTED FILM! It's simply a very sad, and unfortunately true story of the struggles of a man with a deformed face and head who has to move through most of his life without hardly hearing a kind voice, and instead being beaten, laughed at, and eventually dying. I don't remember anything offensive in the way of language. This movie will remind you that even if someone is deformed, that doesn't make them less of a human being.

His loyal kindness, and understanding makes Merrick more of a man than a monster. All of a sudden, he hears John recite, ""The Lord is My Shepard, I Shall Not Want...."", Dr. Treves(Hopkins) is surprised. Being a Christian that he is, John Merrick is a amazing. He meets a variety of people in London, including a dancer named Mrs. Kendal(Anne Bancroft). This woman saw through his visage, only to find a very kind heart. Merrick is an artist as well. His works are a true classic. When the cruel Mr. Bytes(Freddie Jones) claims him back, everyone in the carnival, turned on him and helped Merrick back into society. It was a very strong point where John lashed out at the crowd saying, ""I am not a monster! I am not an animal!"" ""I am a human being!"" He proved his point down outright!

But it's doubtful many people would have anticipated the rare maturity he exhibits here, a combination of forthright compassion with an admirable sense of understatement. Lynch presents Merrick as the ugliest duckling ever, cultured and polite beneath his grotesque appearance, but resigned to a life of misery before his rescue from the freak show by Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) and his eventual introduction to London society. The true story may not have been so poignant, but this is still a striking film, with its empathetic cast, evocative music score, atypical editing scheme, and magnificent black and white photography (courtesy of old pro Freddie Francis), capturing all the soot and steam of England's Industrial Revolution.",

The same is true for ""The elephant man"". This is also a rather conventional film in the oeuvre of (this time) David Lynch. The narrative is easy to follow, unlike for example in some of his other films such as ""Mulholland drive"" (2001). The black and white cinematography of Freddie Francis is in my opinion very beautiful. It creates the ambiance of Victorian England, without the nostalgia so typical of a Charles Dickens adaptation by David Lean.",

I know this may sound stupid, but it was extremely hard, hurting, devastating to see all the abuse and discrimination a person can get just because of his appearance. Sadly, it made me think of how many feel dehumanized not only by their physical capacity, but emocionally.
By a lot of very sweet moments, the protagonist speaks and moves so tenderly I wouldn't think it's John Hurt behind a mask. There's just some deliciousness in the quality of the image in black and white that makes the film even more touching. This adorableness, in my opinion as a teacher, makes it a perfect movie for students to enjoy and learn the most valuable lesson I couldn't ever provide like the film can: everyone deserves respect, understanding and empathy, no matter how they look or where they come from.

I know they played a bit fast-and-loose with the truth when making this film because I went down a deep internet rabbit hole reading up on this man's life after watching the film. That is typically a good sign that a biopic connected with me, when I am so touched by the story that I want to know more. It's hard not to get emotionally invested in a tale like this, particularly when we see an innocent man treated with such indignity through no fault of his own.

221,7 July 2012,Artimidor,9, About monsters and someone with a human soul,"""The Elephant Man"" is not your typical eccentric brainy David Lynch flick, but it was the one that really launched his career as one of the most important filmmakers of today. It is also one of Lynch's most accessible films - realism and story go first. This highly commendable effort results in a very unusual biopic, following the true story of John (originally Joseph) Merrick, who lived in Victorian England of the 19th century, severely deformed from birth on. The picture steers a highly emotional course. For one it shows Merrick's life as a human curiosity, exhibited and exploited for his abhorrent looks, with his abnormality being celebrated, his helplessness greeted with violence to make the caged animal obey. Degraded to a mere creature, the abuse is physical and mental. But we also get to learn about a person named John, his other side, as one among others, who earns our respect as every human being does, regardless of race, belief, deformity, or any other prejudices. As with similar films where the horror is not merely a fantasy of its creators (take for instance Tod Browning's ""Freaks""), ""The Elephant Man"" is serious material one cannot recommend enough to watch, as it will undoubtedly leave an impression. The way the soul of John Merrick is carefully unwrapped is just heartbreakingly executed, helped tremendously of course by the endearing performance of John Hurt. Anthony Hopkins as the doctor who harbors the unfortunate Merrick, fully delivers, as do Hannah Gordon, Sir John Gielgud and Anne Bancroft, who complete the supporting cast. There are very few movies out there which can offer you life altering experiences. ""The Elephant Man"" might be one of them.",

224,30 November 2007,TheUnknown837-1,8, an absolutely wonderful and symbolic film,"Joseph Merrick, commonly referred to the media (this film included) as John Merrick, was a highly sympathized and intelligent man of the 19th century. He was notorious for the extreme disfiguration of his body. It was almost sickening to look at his bulbous head, arms where one was large and the other slender, and the horrible bumps down his back, as well as many other deformations in his skin. Yet, underneath, he was actually one of the most respectable and wise gentlemen of his age. David Finch's ""The Elephant Man"" is a somewhat fictionalized film that overemphasizes the suffering that Merrick went through during his career as a sideshow attraction, but still maintains the point that you should not judge a book by its cover, or in this case, judge a person by his appearance.",

226,27 December 2009,johnmschofield,10, This film should be viewed by everybody,"In my opinion it doesn't matter whether this film is based on a true story or not. It shows perfectly what all humans could look like if everybody suffered from the same condition(s) as Joseph Merrick and there will always be somebody who earns a living out of someone as unfortunate as Joseph and in 2009 it is no different. I have seen a number of documentaries shown recently on British TV where unfortunate people who happen to have an abnormality are paraded and poked and photographed purely because of the way they look. Granted most of these programmes and reasonably well made but all of them showed that if there is money to be made somebody will exploit the unfortunates, it is still the way of the world. What this film attempts to do is to show to the viewer that inside each unfortunate is a human being who has feelings and emotions like everybody else. I do not know if this condition is treatable now but one would hope that medical science could do something to alleviate the distress. It appears these tumours which Joseph had on his body were not malignant but they continued to grow and affect everything he did in his daily life. The film is a sobering look at an intelligent person who is ridiculed and taken advantage of merely because he doesn't physically conform to the norm. It is a testament to everybody who was involved in the films creation that the end result is not a travesty or a white wash but a study mainly of everybody else who came into contact with him and how they reacted to him. He was just a man who happened to look different to everybody else. The numerous people who laughed and stared at him maybe had something inside which was abnormal and that was and is sad. Having said all of this it is only my opinion and thankfully everybody will have different views. I would recommend anyone watch this film and would hope that everybody should watch it at least once.",
227,26 January 2008,Andy-296,9, One of Lynch's best films,"David Lynch's finest film, alongside with perhaps Mulholland Drive. John Hurt, under tons of makeup, stars as David Merrick, the real-life grotesquely deformed individual of Victorian England that was better known as The Elephant Man. Merrick is the virtual slave of a brutish man (a great performance of Freddie Jones) that parades him as a carnival freak until he is rescued by the sensitive doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins). Treves decides to put Merrick in a hospital room, winning over the initial skepticism of its director, John Gielgud. In the hospital, Merrick will start to talk for the first time, begin to regain his dignity, and eventually will become a curiosity of high society before his premature death. Shot in a delicate and expressionist black and white, the only flaw in the movie might be the performance of Ann Bancroft (producer Mel Brooks's wife) as a stage actress interested in Merrick's life. Except for the surreal opening and closing scenes (in which Merrick is born and dies, respectively), here Lynch is relatively restrained, opting for a style that could be called poetic realism. The film earned eight Oscar nominations in all, but left that race empty-handed, an earlier indication that Lynch's films would not be the typical Academy material.",

In this time and age when women strive to look like models and men toned products of the gym with perfect rippled torsos, maybe we should be more understanding and caring to each other and learn that every human is different.

233,20 February 2011,KnightsofNi11,9, One of Lynch's best,"David Lynch never ceases to amaze. The Elephant Man is his second feature film and it is indeed one of his best. It is more accessible than most of his films, but it is undoubtedly Lynchian with all of his style and substance rolled into one hypnotic experience. This movie is a biopic of John Merrick, otherwise known as the Elephant Man. He was a man who suffered from severely grotesque deformities. The movie opens with a doctor named Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) stumbling upon Merrick at a sideshow circus where Merrick was one of the attractions. Hopkins manages to get Merrick out of the circus and to a hospital where he is cared for. From there he makes his way into London society, proving to be intelligent with a great personality. This movie is such an excellent portrayal of what it means to be human and how we perceive being human. It is a heartfelt tale told in the most unique form possible a la David Lynch.",

A final surrralistically well achieved by the autonomous nuances that the same film is being built and used throughout it. Great denotation of the moral, ethical and scientific ignorance of the time. There is also the fact of how to make films of the time, which must be taken into account when analyzing the tape. A very good performance by the cast.

Here, in ""The Elephant Man,"" we are regaled with a stark contrast between the coarse, vulgar, grasping ""lower orders"" and the refined, courteous, compassionate upper class. Coincidentally, Jack the Ripper's most infamous work was performed against several ""Unfortunates"" in Whitechapel, 1888-90, during the last years of this subject's life. From the opening sequence suggesting the gang rape of a pretty young woman by a herd of roaring, rampaging elephants to her dissolving portrait in the stars accompanied by a Samuel Barber adagio, the cheap sentiment is unalloyed.

Among movie bad guys, he stands out as the personification of evil for the sake of greed. An actor of lesser skills playing this role would have done an injustice to the entire film. Bravo Freddie! With this flawless production, one can feel the moodiness and dreariness of Victorian England literally dripping off the screen. Add to that the acting of John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins plus the supporting parts of John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller and the aforementioned Freddie Jones and The Elephant Man is one for the ages.",
243,19 December 2009,jonesberney,10, Half elephant half man? It could only be David Lynch!,"Aside from what is generally considered Lynch's masterpiece 'DUNE' (the scene where Baron Harkonnen pulls out that ginger lad's buttplug and he bleeds to death had me wrapped in bad dreams for months!) this is my second favourite of his films just behind Mullholland Drive and neck and neck with Scanners. I always wonder when i'm watching a David Lynch film, ""Where does he get all his incredible ideas from?"" and my friend Carlton Jackson said that he only eats cheese all the time. Apparently he actually has a sculptor living with him who sculpts various cheeses into the shapes of other foods, and then another artist meticulously paints the cheese sculptures with edible paint, so they look like other foods but taste like cheese. My friend Carlton Jackson also said that David Lynch is a real prankster and has lots of things made of cheese that look like other things that he gives as gifts to his friends. Apparently he bought a new house for a friend of his years ago and his friend didn't realise but thought the house smelled a bit whiffy, and then when it came to summertime the house started sweating really badly and he woke up in the night and his house had literally melted around him and he had to be pulled out of a four foot thick layer of cheese by the local firemen, and Lynch was there laughing like the devil and took a polaroid photograph of his friend and slapped his knee, and said, ""I got you real good Charlie boy!"" But apparently the gag kind of backfired because his friend had been cocooned in the cheese all night and so much of it seeped into his system that it went straight to his brain and his friend has since been trapped in a perpetual nightmare state and cries all the time. My friend Carlton Jackson said that Lynch made a movie about it called The Straight Story but i haven't seen that so i can't comment on it. So to get back to the point i think the cheese helps Lynch's imagination a lorra lorra lot. I first saw this film at an arty cinema in Nottingham and i thought i wasn't going to enjoy it when i realised it was in black and white, but as soon as Elephantman came onto the screen i knew it was going to be a blast. There is a lot of intentional humour in the film, like the way Elephantman talks, and Pauline Quirke and Dexter Fletcher are in it so it definitely is a comedy movie, but i don't think the audience picked up on the comic elements of the film because no one in the cinema was laughing like i was, (i was actually rudely told to shut up or get out at one point) but i enjoyed it a great deal. I didn't think Elephantman should have died at the end, i thought that put a bit of a downer on the film, but it is a David Lynch movie so i guess you're supposed to expectly unexpected. My friend Carlton Jackson said there is a deleted scene from the film where you see Elephantman's mum having sex with the elephant but it was cut from the final edit because a lot of people were being sick on their popcorn when they saw it. Overall i give this film 6 out of ten because the special effects weren't very good, you could tell Elephantman was made on a computer sometimes and at one point you can definitely see it was John Hurt under the mask, so i would give this film about 5 out of 10. If you like this movie i recommend you see the film Mask with Eric Stoltz (Which is pretty much the same but in colour) or The Mask which is a Jim Carrey film.",
244,6 January 2018,oOoBarracuda,8, Humanizing the Elephant Man,"David Lynch and Mel Brooks sound like a cinematic partnership that teeters on the edge between the surrealism of a Lynch film and a gag from a Brooks film. Nevertheless, these two would work together in 1980 on Lynch's second feature, The Elephant Man. Simultaneously, yet separately, both Brooks and Lynch had interest in seeing The Elephant Man, a script written by Eric Bergren and Christopher De Vore based on the novel by Sir Frederick Treves. Treves book highlights the heartbreaking existence of John Merrick, whose severe disfigurement relegated him to a near imprisonment as a circus freak show exhibit. After making a film as polarizing as Eraserhead, Lynch wasn't exactly having to sift through many offers for work. Thanks to Stuart Cornfeld, a film producer who enjoyed Eraserhead, he picked a project that he thought Lynch might be interested in. After Lynch confirmed interest, Cornfeld, who was also an associate of Mel Brooks, took the idea to him thinking it would be a good venture for his newly founded Brooksfilm production company. Needing to be sold on the relatively unknown David Lynch, Brooks was advised to watch his debut feature, Eraserhead. Perhaps surprisingly, Mel Brooks took enough from his screening of Eraserhead to hire Lynch on the spot and put his full confidence in him to direct The Elephant Man. The chance Brooks took with David Lynch was monumental and put Lynch on the map. The Elephant Man was a huge success, nominated for eight Academy Awards, paving the way for Lynch to be able to continue his career in filmmaking. The partnership with Mel Brooks also allowed Lynch access to such a phenomenal cast including John Hurt, Anthony Hopkins, John Gielgud, and Anne Bancroft, Lynch had come a long way from selling newspapers to pay his cast. Despite many Hollywood producers being ill-prepared to properly respond to a film like Eraserhead, the artistic integrity was not lost on all, and the opportunity for David Lynch to flourish had just begun.",

247,16 February 2021,hoernkeem,9," The Elephant Man (1980, David Lynch) Lynch's beautiful black & white homage to the beauty and grotesqueness of humanity","The Elephant Man (1980, David Lynch) SPOILER REVIEW
After his breakout cult film 'Eraserhead' David Lynch's second feature tackled the real life story of Joseph Merrick colloquially known as The Elephant Man due to his intense disfigurement. Lynch's weird sensibility does creep in a bit, but for the most part it is a pretty straight forward directing job. He does shoot it in gorgeous black and white really capturing Victorian London. Interestingly I think 1980 was the last time more than one film in black and white was nominated for best picture with the other being 'Raging Bull'. 'The Elephant Man' was nominated for 8 Academy Awards but wound up winning none. This film actually prompted the Academy to add a category for makeup and hairstyling.
Frederick Treves, played excellently by a young looking Anthony Hopkins, is a doctor in London and stumbles upon Merrick at a freak show. Merrick is played by John Hurt who is unrecognizable under all of the makeup and prosthetics. He did receive an Academy Award nomination for the performance. He is basically being held captive by a sadistic carnival barker named Bytes. At the time he is found it is unknown if Merrick can speak or if he has any level of intelligence. Most assume he is just some form of mute, idiot dullard. In reality he is more like an abused pet so indoctrinated by the whip that he doesn't speak. The doctor steals him away and secrets him in the hospital where he works and when Merrick is discovered it causes a fervor. Some are scared and others are shocked, but as time passes Merrick reveals a tender, gentle soul beneath the grotesque form he inhabits, and he has a spirit that hasn't been destroyed even though it easily could have. He becomes somewhat of a star in Victorian society winning the friendship of the actress Madge Kendal, played by Anne Bancroft, and even Queen Victoria herself who, in her stead sends Alexandra to treat with him. Treves fears this is just another version of the side show he wrested Merrick from. Merrick, thanks to a drunken orderly, is stolen away by Bytes and is displayed again, however, the side show freaks all help Merrick escape who makes his way back to London and leads to Hurt's iconic scream as he is harassed by a mob, ""I am a not an animal. I am a human being!"" Eventually he is taken back to the hospital. One day he decides he wants to lay down and sleep like a normal person knowing it will kill him, but in a way he will also be free and never at the mercy of those who would do him harm again.
It is a brilliantly insidious film that contains an obvious theme of humanity. In Merrick we have the physical form we deem to be monster, but time and again it is the run of the mill ""normal"" people who display the true monstrous and cruel behavior. There is light and humanity for society as well though embodied by Treves, most of the hospital staff and Kendal. It is quite a resonating story based on Merrick's real life story. The script and actors are amazing and in it is shot beautifully by David Lynch. The cinematography, script, acting, makeup and set design are all exemplary. It is easy to see why this film was deemed to be one of the best of 1980.

But, its humanity depends only on the initiative and the unselfishness of ONE man, played sublimely by Anthony Hopkins. This doctor faced stubbornly the denigration, the jealousy or the pure misunderstanding by his colleagues, thereby risking his reputation and even his job. The 'Elephant Man' is physically a horrendously 'painted bird', whose deformed features are cynically exploited by 'businessmen'. Being 'abnormal', he is hounded by racists and fiercely attacked by the mob. Psychologically, however, he himself is the most generous of men. Of course, this movie doesn't brush a very 'bright' picture of mankind. Its harsh and violent scenes are nearly unbearable and go straight to the heart of a 'conscious' spectator. 'The Elephant Man' is a horror movie, but not in the normal sense. The horror doesn't come from a seriously misshapen man, but from his treatment by his 'fellow-creatures' and their barbaric slogan: individuals who are not normal have to be slaughtered.

Inarticulate and abused, Merrick is the virtual slave of a carnival barker (Freddie Jones) until dedicated London doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins in a powerfully understated performance) rescues him from the life and offers him an existence with dignity. Anne Bancroft costars as the actress whose visit to Merrick makes him a social curiosity, with John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller as dubious hospital staffers won over by Merrick. David Lynch earned his only Oscar nominations as director and co-writer of this somber drama, which he shot in a rich black-and-white palette, a sometimes stark, sometimes dreamy visual style that at times recalls the offbeat expressionism of his first film, Eraserhead. It remains a perfect marriage between traditional Hollywood historical drama and Lynch's unique cinematic eye, a compassionate human tale delivered in a Gothic vein.

Now, 30 years later, I decided to watch it again. Nothing has changed. It's almost too powerful to watch. I well up every minute. Finding out so long after that A. Hopkins is one of the lead character and that Lynch was the director is just a cherry on the cake. Never a movie has stayed with me for so long, and I am certain it will stay for ever engraved in my memory and my heart. Unforgettable.",
277,11 May 2020,krational66,7, He's not the elephant man.,"David lynch's expression is still experimental, had seen years before Japan stage version of the elephant man, more attention to the psychological description of characters, then don't understand why emphasize looks like people dies slowly lie down, see the understood because of his spine deformity, like normal person lie down and sleep become his dream, he is more a way of taking.
In the film, John self-imposed isolation from the start to have the friendship, and the doctors put him as their friends, and the doctor, but because of heart guilty can't respond to his friendship, dare not look into the eyes of his. Until in the end, also did not respond to his friendship, just say, see you happy I am also very happy. He knew he didn't do friends. When the doctor's position is out of curiosity, later see John at the moment of being touched, but everyone just sympathize with him, to feel sorry for him, that's right, the circus owner locked John and monkeys together, beat him, regard him as a beast, and he finally because doctors, has been treated as a person. All he wanted was to be human, to be able to walk, to be able to go to the theater, to be able to go to church, to be able to work, to support himself, not to depend on the handouts of others.
Why does the person who contradicts the doctor begin with, ""you and your elephant man?"" Is not John himself, he was ""like a man"" label on the champions league, and this label is posted on his face. The hands, body, is obvious. He need to cling to, a person is not his own is does not have its own role in the society, so he is the boss of the circus, he is a doctor, he is just an attachment, a property, a clown.
John was admitted to the hospital through the mercy of the doctor, the stage moved from the circus to the hospital, and the audience moved from the third class to the first class. In stage plays, like a person can't see myself, so you can't see the mirror, he can't face myself, ""he is like a mirror"", however, he is always ready to appreciate other people, ""you are beautiful"", ""crutch is very good-looking,"" people find affirmation of the self through to his mercy, ""look at this poor man, so alive, I can be a lot better"",
Ironically, however, is so ugly appearance of John, in faith, in 21 years to recite the bible, is at the top of the house just looked down at the cathedral to sincerely to build up to the church, his spirit was not tainted by the reality, he have no hatred, he is just with gratitude, he always say thank you, for all the damage, no hate.
Finally found it, he said he felt himself, he finally don't have to hide in a dark place, finally is not like a person, but to a man called John. He built a church, ""said the"" end "", as if all his desire, not caring. His wish, is no longer a symbol, is no longer like a person, he is just an ordinary man, he knows that he is not the ordinary people, also is unable to be ordinary people, he can't through the normal sleep and to prove himself, but he finally completed the wish, too. So, as human being's heart, he need not to think he is like a person, he finally like personal living, like a So the story of man is over, and he is not finished as a man, just like so many other people, the day is eternal.",

279,4 January 2000,Afracious,10, A moving and touching look at compassion and acceptance,"The film begins with a hazy scene of a woman being trampled by an elephant and a baby crying, then quickly switches to the dark and dreary location of Victorian London, and a freak-show where there is a commotion. We see all the faces of spectators, aghast and appalled by their viewing of a particular freak. A doctor passing by notices this and investigates further, and eventually sees the freakish man. That scene is one of the best not only in this film, but in all of film. The tear rolling down the cheek of the doctor, played brilliantly by Sir Anthony Hopkins, is very touching. The doctor decides to take the man to his hospital to look after him and teach him. The rest of the cast are all exemplary, with Freddy Jones as the freak-show owner and Sir John Gielgud as the head of the hospital, and John Hurt Oscar-nominated as the Elephant Man, with also the make-up effects being excellent. The Oscar-nominated direction by Lynch is perfect, too. Some of the early scenes have a feel of Eraserhead, with the film being black and white and the drab location with all the industrial steam, and the sound also being perfect. The ending is like a salvation with a look into the stars and the heavens. It is an exquisitely crafted, touching tale of human compassion. A masterpiece.",

In this movie a young spry Anthony Hopkins plays a doctor seeking to better the living conditions of John Merrick but also discover the reasons behind his baffling medical condition. Though he is most likely the most redeemable character in the movie, one must question if he shows hospitality to Mr.Merrick merely out of kindness or wish to further his career in the medical field.

Except some deviations which probably don't affect the main theme, the movie in general sticks to the historical facts. Anthony Hopkins displays a superb performance as Dr. Treves who finds himself in a moral dilemma: his humane approach to help Merrick from the cruelties of outside world is counterbalanced by his scientific curiosity which drives him to study Merrick's abnormal physical condition and exhibit him in conferences reminiscent of despicable freak shows. In comparison to the pictures of actual J. Merrick of his time, the makeup artist does a phenomenal job on John Hurt to recreate Merrick's disfigured appearance. The fact that all this happens in a pre-CGI era further adds to the value of the work.

306,12 October 2007,gentendo,8, Taking Merrick in Complete Context,"One of the predominant themes the director portrays in this film is in teaching the viewer not to be an ""offender for a word."" Given the loglinea permanently disfigured man is freed from the debasing life of freak-show entertaining and is given an opportunity to feel and be treated as a human beingthe viewer is taught not to cast unrighteous judgment onto another by not taking offensive of their outward appearance (Merrick's disfigurement). Instead, they are generously taught to embrace the inward appearance of people, in this case the spirit of John Merrick, and to treat him with just as much respect as a ""normal"" person would be treated. In short, it is a film that hones in on the importance of observing internal rather than external beauty.",
307,11 December 2002,Cherubin,7, good but not great,"""The Elephant Man"", rather than being all around great, is actually a mixture of good and bad. The good is that  , well, first of all, the cinematography is nothing less than amazing, feeling like a series of cutting edge paintings. For example, all the dark passage ways utilized really do seem scary and mysterious, the extended shot of the pipework is art at its finest, and the dream sequences are some of the most disturbing ever committed to film. Otherwise, the film has all around excellent acting (Hopkins as Dr. Treves is especially memorable, presenting the character as a gentle but realistic hero with self conscious doubts about his own virtues) and no punches are pulled in presenting the deformed main character being abused or making others feel uneasy. Indeed, in most of the scenes where Merrick tries to interact with people in a normal way, you can just sense how awkward the ""normal"" characters feel in spite of trying to act like his deformity does not matter. And when he gets bullied, he REALLY gets bullied (you´ll probably cheer when Dr.  Treves gives the abusive hospital worker a serious a-kicking in return). Otherwise, though, the problem with the movie is that Merrick is not really a well fleshed out character (no pun intended). The basic recipe for him is ""take a deformed person and make him stereotypically innocent and slightly socially retarded to show how isolated he was"". John Hurt conveys this quality well under a heavy makeup job but that´s pretty much the beginning and end of the character. Also, David Lynch, being David Lynch, usually focuses on getting the most violent shock value, absurdity, surrealist weirdness, or odd awkwardness out of most scenes. Plus, 1940s style melodrama and ""Eraserhead"" style surrealism, as good as they are on their own terms, are uncomfortably combined here. Hence, it sometimes even feels as if Lynch is making fun of the screenplay. All in all, though, it´s worth a look if you want to see something different.",

Personal to Lynch and exploring his key themes of dreams and the effects of society on the individual, The Elephant Man is a beautiful, haunting piece of film-making. Although a simple story on the surface, as expected of Lynch films, it is also psychologically complex. Here he explores the effect of industry and class in society and draws on dark themes deriving from Bakhtin's notion of Carnival in his exploration of the marginalisation of difference and the quality of life in the developing post-Industrial Revolution world. The script is both heartfelt and precise and Lynch's direction remains taught and accomplished, enhanced by some beautiful black and white wide-angle cinematography and effective linear editing. The acting, particularly from John Hurt, is completely faultless, with every emotion hitting home.

Despite this, the 'elephant man' surprises & triumphs in his attitude towards his predicament by demonstrating the only human quality that really counts, inner beauty. There are so many moments in this film that had me noting comparisons with the prejudice and attitudes towards physically challenged people present in the UK today, that I wonder if this film is more relevant today that it was when it was made.

The double personality of John Merrich, who goes from a gentle and refined man in the day to a poor beast that can only scream in the night, reflects the tension and evolutions of the power relations of that time.

While ""Eraserhead"" is nightmarish, cold, highly disturbing and surrealist, ""The elephant man"" is dramatic and more stylized; and very dark; a somehow rare combination: dramatic and dark; it aimed towards a totally different direction - drama and biography. In ""Eraserhead"", Lynch shocked the audience with unreal nightmarish images and events, cold and emotionless characters and dystopian-ish images; here, his purpose was to leave the audience drowning in tears - there are characters full of emotions, emotional scenes, extreme sadness, sadness and again sadness and everything is marked with stunning and exquisite imagery related to the industrial revolution (+ symbolic imagery).
Probably Anthony Hopkins' first real big performance; John Hurt has also done a really good job here.
A movie that questions humanity and the principles of morality.",

But what matters is this film is based off a real man who suffered with his tumour deformity who was mistreated and displayed at a freak show until one kind man, Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) took an interest in him and bought him into his own care at the hospital.

This is a very sad movie. John Merrick is bullied and harassed by many characters. This will probably make you cry if you get sad easily. I didn't cry, but I just don't cry from movies. It did get sad though.
This movie is in black and white, so people might think it is boring because it is in black and white. But if you have any common decency, you won't care about the graphics. In fact, they made this movie in 1980 when color movies were possible, but they made it black and white on purpose to make it feel old, because this events on which this movie is based was a long time ago.

One should watch it simply for those two aspects alone. Hopkins puts in an average performance as his character feels far two dimensional even with the depth they try to give him. Lynch does Lynch things when it is unneeded, though at the time they would have looked avant-garde today they are Lynch things meaning someone who tries to be different but ultimately keeps doing the same thing. Thankfully he did not do too many of them and the movie keeps a steady grasp on reality. The script seems a little heavy handed in its sentimentality, it also feels like it was punched up so that the audience does not ""get bored"" which ultimately leaves a piece meant to discuss the nature of humanity but a brief glimpse at the strength of the human spirit.",

If you do not feel something, sadness or anger, while watching this film then i'm sorry to say, you are heartless. David Lynch directs the story of John Merrick (Joseph Merrick was his real name), unfortunately known as The Elephant Man because of his deformities. Unfortunately, this film is all I know about the man, but it has inspired me to find out all I can about his life. I had heard an unfortunate rumor that he was considered a suspect for Jack The Ripper. But if this film holds any truth, then it could not even be a possibility. I hope at least that this film captured the true John Merrick, which is a man with a heart. Not many films make me cry but this one most certainly did. It shows how cruel people are, especially towards those who are different from themselves. But it also shows people with heart who treat him with the utmost respect and who truly do feel for him, unlike those who abuse and use him for a buck. I can see this movie in life itself with all it's beauty and cruelty. David Lynch directs seemingly using inspiration from classics such as Freaks, Frankenstein and his own, Eraserhead, all in black and white such as this. If I have any problem with this film it would have to be, and i'm sorry to say, Anthony Hopkins. His acting in this I find rather odd, and this coming from a fan of David Lynch, who i've seen just about everything by, so having the knowledge of Lynch's odd characters. But something seems off by Hopkins performance that I can't quite put my finger on. He seems tired, confused and upset even, as if he and the director did not get along well. It's not that his performance is necessarily bad, otherwise I would have given this 9 stars instead of 10. But it's John Hurt that does an amazing job with the character that he portrays. The make-up is incredible that I was surprised to see that it wasn't done by either Rick Baker or Stan Winston but rather by a man named Christopher Tucker. In my opinion this film should be mandatory viewing for all and used as a ""life skills"" course on how to be and how not to be as a human being. This world would be a much better place if we all treated one another equally, differences and all.",
338,2 August 2013,LLinus,8," If you can't help someone, at least don't hurt them.","What is most outstanding about this movie is the directing, David Lynch being able to capture the details of the time that it's set out to be, a moderate feeling of how judgmental and how cold our society are capable of and shows us who the real monsters very well could be. It's were everyone tags along, kicking the outcast while he's down and no one will be pointed out or blamed since they are hiding behind each other, metaphorically speaking. It's a great cast you can't deny that, what I loved about it was that I actually felt that I was watching a movie from the past, it didn't feel like it was from the 80s, just make the picture and sound quality inferior and you could fool anyone. The great idea behind the black and white picture gives us a dull, yet magnificent indication of what kind of mood they are trying to distinguish. ",

David Lynch's directorial follow up to Eraserhead couldn't be less predictable- this is every bit a mainstream film, with the occasional flash of stylistic Joi de Vivre' that occupied the entire narrative of Eraserhead (industrial noise, abstract/nightmarish imagery of deformed faces).  The film loses a hint of perfection on account of its' slightly choppy editing (and too many fade outs) which makes it feel incomplete, but otherwise, this portrayal of a human being doomed to a constant freak show' attraction by exhibitionists (those who care for him are just as guilty as those who don't) is likely to reduce the most hardened viewer to tears 9/10.",

Several scenes in this movie are shocking to realize, although there may be something horrific of it. Not horrific as in gore, but that of a story that you find true and you want to avoid it. In plain words, it is how mean, cruel, and cowardly we can be when there is something unknown. This story reminds me of Edward Scissorhands, in that something unnatural is introduced into a stable environment, and chaos breaks out. But wait!! This film also introduces a grandness played by Anthony Hopkins, whose character shows us a better, kind side of humans.

This film is a beautiful melding of director david lynch's first feature, eraserhead, and a perfect sense of commercial mystery history swamped in surrealism. Not only does the elephant man stand out for his looks, but it seems all others in the film are so affected by him that their movements, pace and strange sense of fear are affected by the elephant man. Its a bizarre but digestible story about a once circus freak, and its loaded with custonm lynchian industiral eerie spooky factory ambiance...perhaps a reminder of hearing the outside filtered by being in the womb. I feel throughout the film that the audience become a type of elephant man themselves. The story surrounds a surgeon from london hospital who takes on the elephant man to study him and tryo to integrate him within society as best he can. The core to this story is humanity...being human despite oddities. This 4k uhd presentation is the best black and while 4k restoration i have ever seen. Virtually no grain...it was shot by master freddie francis with low asa film stock and its been preserved fantastically. The blu ray version is not too far off in terms of compariable quality. The 2.0 sound is dynamic and you can get enveloped by ambiances(the spooky ones) while finding the dialog flloating in front of you in 3d (kinda like how that sea dream 3d movie of the 70s had that jellyfish virtually floating in front of you), the extras are merely complimentary extras, but some of the interviews give some depth.

What was so sad was that the ""Elephant Man"" who was not even known by his name, was expected to live as an outcast because of his disease. All who he was as a person or all that he had to offer was discredited. It broke my heart when he said that he was a human being, not an animal.

355,25 January 2008,buonanotte,10, Excellent,"I think it's a pity David Lynch abandoned the path of a traditional screenplay in his following movies. ""The elephant man"" is like ""Eraserhead"" with the benefit of a realistic pattern. Basically what happens around John Merrick is a process of cleansing. At the beginning he's dirty, oppressed and isolated. Then he gets through a recovery period, while he receives assistance and increases his knowledge. At some point of the story (more or less 30 minutes before the end) he's left alone in order to double-check his new abilities. Then, obviously, we end up in a triumphant happy ending. I wish to see a film like that, instead of another ""Inland empire"". I've heard that it was considered a sort of sequel for ""Mulholland drive"", but I slightly disagree with this view. If you don't have a character, you don't have a story. If you don't have a story, you have an artworks gallery. That's what David Lynch is when he writes his own films.

Dr. Treves as Henry Higgins, takes the circus freak, teaches him how to speak politely, dresses him in nice suits, and makes him presentable to society. The Elephant Man is even allowed to attend the theater. The only problem is, as the film reveals, his life in society is not that much different than when he was in the circus--either way, because of his deformities, people want to come see him because of their curiosity. He is still viewed as a freak of society. Very few characters in the film really seemed to care about John Merrick, even though he seemed to believe that they were all his ""friends."" Everyone seemed to be using the Elephant Man to advance their own careers, or to make money. The only character, besides Dr. Treves, that seems to really be interested in the Elephant Man as a person is the actress, Mrs. Kendal.

Elephant Man is experiencing an unfortunate abduction, but he returns in a short time, is admitted to the hospital and begins to live happily ever after. They fill in between scenes that will have a smile on the faces between the doctor and Elephant Man. You never get bored while watching, but you don't feel like watching a big plot.

380,28 January 2008,avijit_n,10, Very nice movie,This is one of the nice movie I have ever seen. Nice acting. The story is great. It tells the agonies of the disable person. Many times we laugh at the physically challenged person but seldom we feel their pain.,
381,5 June 2018,viabilityfer,10," Beautiful examination of the ""appearence"" social stigma","Lynch's second film succeeds on every level it intends to. It is a bleak and uncompromising look at how society judges others based on appearance, or really based on any social stigmas. Being a Lynch film, there is the classic Lynchian dream sequence, as well as flawless cinematography and great performances. John Hurt plays the ""Elephant Man"" perfectly, and the makeup effects are truly haunting, while at the same time evoke pity and strong sympathy for how this man is treated by society. There are plenty of insane, morally revolting characters, as is common in many of Lynch's works. At the end of the day, this may be the most sad and powerful Lynch film. As while his other works may examine the human condition very successfully, none come close to the uncompromising cruelty and mean spirited-ness as seen in ""The Elephant Man."" At the same time though, there are genuinely good people that want to help improve his life. All in all, the film is a phenomenal expression of the human condition, and should be taken as a warning to avoid applying social stigmas and barriers to individuals.",

383,11 January 2009,angus1878,5," scary, or is it just me","i am so glad i read lots of comments on this movie particularly the ones that hit the nail with me...i read reviews on this film,beautiful,heart wrenching, moving,is it just me i thought,the best review i read on here was ""its not black and white"", ""its black and grey"" I'm haunted by this film, yes it got me interested,but it also put me off living, sleeping and eating for about a month, till the vision went away.........so i guess you could say job well done...don't get me wrong its a brilliant movie,but to me its horror,but it also got me interested in the subject,apparently he was a famous icon in 1900 england and yet before the film no one was really any the wiser,i also read that the mentioned Joseph Merrick wasn't as dumb as it seemed stories of him renting out a shop to show himself off to make money from his own appearance,so a keen business brain too,i too have seen the allegedly real cap of his,they had an ELEPHANT MAN exhibition in Madame Tussuad's in Blackpool,why i went i don't know cause i knew it would throw me for a while but all the same i went...recreating the dark streets of old London town, very romantic, and there he was in the corner in all his waxed glory, bloody terrifying,the one thing that sticks with me on a lighter note is English comedian frank skinner had done routine talking about the elephant man and was saying how while watching the movie he noticed that he didn't look like an elephant but his head looked more like fresh ginger,but obviously it would be bad business to be paraded around various cities as the ""AMAZING GINGER MAN""",

In my opinion it was realist but some parts was absurd.In example his kind of die wad absurd.I did not like that part.I was reading to story. I didn't like this part.In contrast, The Queen's visited him.I think it was nice and kindly.Everyone understood.he was good and friendly.The Elephant Man died at the end of the story.

386,20 June 2000,Count Orlok,10, The Greatest Example Of Courage,"I have always had unusual fascinations, and Joseph Merrick is no exception. At the time the film was released in 1980, I was but a mere second grader. I was enthralled by the mystery and spook factor of such a dark and dreary film. Today, I am a film student/director. My films are mostly in the style of David Lynch, David Fincher and Ridley Scott - dark and eerie. The mood which low lighting creates is unsurpassed in its ability to create a dreamlike atmosphere. Furthermore, the majority of the stories I write and the films that I intend to make one day, all revolve around persons whom have had to overcome seemingly insurmountable struggles. While as a boy it was the esoteric 'creepiness' which interested me, I look back upon such experiences as being instrumental in shaping me artistically. I feel there is no better story to tell than that of people who live in a world of intolerance and have the ability to create for themselves a life despite their outcast status. My compliments to you as well for dedicating yourself to such an endlessly interesting subject as Joseph Merrick. His is a lesson to be relished not only from the perspective of disabilities, but from one of self-respect, steadfastness and determination; Very unique characteristics in a situation which might daunt the average man.",
387,22 December 2013,corruption101,10, Nothing More Than Life Changing,"I'll be honest. I looked at other reviews stating how emotional and heartbreaking this true story. I disregarded such descriptions and came to start watching ""The Elephant Man"" for pure enjoyment. Though what I quickly realised throughout and by the end of the film was this was a piece of art, a masterpiece, that was not supposed to be made for one's own entertainment. It personally made me question the ideals of society, even though the film was during Victorian times, it made me question the curiosity and harshness of current society's in their upfront disgust to those who are different, and not considered 'normal'. This is the one film that has REALLY made me question. I urge everyone to watch this movie at some point in their life as I promise that this is an experience that will be eternal and ultimately life-changing.",

The most sensitive and sweet film I've seen in a long time. This film should be seen by any David Lynch fan or any fan of film, to be honest. It creates a dreamlike reality of vulnerability and innocence which adds to a moving performance from John Hurt in this true story of a man who forgives and overcomes the hardship forced upon him by societies ignorance.",

395,11 February 2016,contaminatedpictures,9, Lynch at his least confusing,"I've always been a big fan of David Lynch and his surrealist films but I never got around to watch Elephant Man. I didn't know what I was expecting but I got a lot more of this film than I originally thought I would. It's a sad portrayal of the cynical nature of man and John Hurt's portrayal as the deformed man is at times heartbreaking yet brilliant. Lynch takes a step back and delivers a film that is a lot more narratively coherent to the average viewer and he also offers some of his best work. From the beginning when you the viewer is straining to see the 'freak' in its captivity to when you are sympathizing for his unfortunate treatment, there is never a moment that felt forced or unbelievable. This is definitely a film to see for not just Lynch fans but for people who appreciate film in general. It's a must see.",

398,1 November 2008,cpt_caveman25,10, Truly a timeless classic...,"One of the greatest films of my time. There are so very few films that can achieve greatness on every level. It is simply remarkable that this film was made in 1980. It holds the charm of a film released in the 50's. I have to say it is a true masterpiece of cinema. It is a gem that will be cherished for all generations to come. A true tale of the cruelty and beauty of the human race. It will force you to rethink which crowd you would be part of and which you would want to be part of. Would you react and judge the way most did, or with the greater, higher moral ground that is taken at the end of the film. The hope that most would react with the latter is proof of the indomitable human spirit to provide good will to all men. The greatness on every level achieved in this film is to include: cinematography, make up, Direction, camera work, human story and acting. It will remain as a testament against the belief that mankind is a failed race. Every human being throughout time can relate in part to the emotions of ridicule and disconnection from his fellow man suffered by The Elephant Man. However, very few can truthfully claim to have the heart to not hate after enduring such. That is truly the greatest woe of man. Thank you.",

402,1 April 2007,Winter85,10, I'm Not An Animal!!!!,"1st off..let me say that The Elephant Man, is a film that will stand the test of time. Sir Anthony Hopskins, and John Hurt, and other terrific actors did a tremendous job on this film. The 1st thing I noticed was that, this movie was in black&white. At 1st I was very skeptical if that would work..To tell u the truth it did. Having the movie black&white gave this movie some deep feeling and powerful emotions..since this movie was based in the 1890's, it was the perfect fit for B&W film..Casting John Hurt as John Merrick, was the perfect choice because, he is a tremendous actor, not well known to the audience, so that gives it a more punch for the money.Because after the film ends. You wanna know who was that actor that played John Merrick so well..Anothny Hopskins.WOW what can I say, what compassion this fellow had.This movie really brought a tear in my eyes. The transformation of John Hurt..UNBELIEVABLE..To bad back then the academy awards didn't have a category for best make-up design.and the only reason that john hurt didn't win the Oscars is because I think that the audience never saw his face..BUT WHAT A JOB WELL DONE!!!I would give this movie 100 Stars, but the Max is 10....",

404,21 May 2007,Demondreamin,10, A true gem in cinema history,"The elephant man is an almost immediately engaging movie based almost entirely on true events and people (and is fairly accurate as far as my knowledge of the actual story goes). The story is indeed quite a sad one which the fact that it was shot in black in white, and just the overall feel of the movie doesn't help. If you upset easy have tissues handy. I thought the acting was right where it should have been and was overall really good, especially for the elephant man. The only thing I could be somewhat skeptical on is that for some it may seem to move a little to slow and not really pick you up as the movie does draw a lot on having empathy and sympathy for John Merrick (the elephant man). Its a very emotional movie and to me you kind have to be in the mood to watch it. So if your not up for an emotional drawing movie it may not be for you, or at least not at the time. The meaning and undertones of the movie is a statement about society and how we react to things, the true meaning of beauty, how we think of things, and to me how terrible people can be to others who are different. It simply is a great movie, a classic that really should be sat down and watched at least one good time.",
