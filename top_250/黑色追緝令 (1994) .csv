0,17 November 2005,kylopod,10, The masterpiece without a message,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.",/

2,12 November 2020,SebMoz,10, A masterpiece of screenwriting,"This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. The movie doesn't seem to be about any spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. The characters and preformances in this movie are practically perfect. This is still one of the best performances I've seen from Sam Jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an Oscar. Each scene has its own unique flavour and charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. The comedy is great, the serious moments are great, every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist. This movie is just such a great time, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time.",e
3,24 July 2014,gogoschka-1,10, The rebirth of a genre – and film history,"I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.",v
4,10 April 2020,gautammayya,10, The most rewatchable movie of all time,Possibly the most influential movie made in history since the first movie ever made .Even after 25 years and a countless number of copy cats this movie absolutely holds up and feels fresh.,i
5,13 January 2021,hockeydog-75085,10, Not overrated at all,Before I saw this I assumed it was probably overrated. I was wrong. It lives up to and surpasses its reputation in pretty much every way. I would definitely recommend.,e
6,6 November 2020,jaaanmerz,10, My Favourite Movie,"Pulp Fiction is the most original, rule breaking film I have ever seen. Instead of following the widely used 3 act structure, Pulp Fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first, once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share. Anyone who says that the movie lacks focus or has no meaning hasn't analysed enough. I highly recommend this film since it is number one on my list of my favourite movies of all time.",w
7,20 April 2020,Jeremy_Urquhart,10," Always has been, and always will be a personal favourite","Perhaps before I start talking about why I think Pulp Fiction works on so many levels, I should mention briefly how I came to watch the film. Pulp Fiction was a film I had heard of at a very young age, and I'm not quite sure why. I had also wanted to see it for a very long time- again, I'm not quite sure why. Maybe the mere fact that it was R-rated and notorious for its violence perked the interest of my 14-year-old self. Nevertheless, I got round to watching it about a month before my 15th birthday- incredibly late at night on an occasion where I found myself home alone. I recall being blown away by the film, but also somewhat overwhelmed and confused. I had never seen anything like it before, and walked away from it being kinda sure I'd enjoyed it. I couldn't say for sure though.",/
8,4 January 2021,auuwws,9, Pulp Fiction,"One of the best movies I have ever seen is a fun and enjoyable story, as most of the film's characters were excellent, and it brought back the character of Butch and his girlfriend, Vincent was the best character and his death was shocking and I did not. Expect that, the interconnectedness of the film's stories was excellent, the direction in the film was excellent The film, the acting in the movie was very cool, I recommend it, and it is the best film by Quentin Tarantino",r
9,7 December 2009,Hitchcoc,10, One of the Funniest Movies Ever,"It took fifteen years and a subscription to Netflix to finally get around to seeing this film. It was well worth the wait. If all one were to see is the byplay between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, it would be worth the price of admission. But this is only part of the incredible effect this film has. I don't even like gore in movies; I avoid it. But Tarentino weaves a culture of violence where there is actual humanity. We care about these bad guys. There is scene after scene of people being pushed to the limit. The very idea that the boxer, played by Bruce Willis, would risk everything to retrieve a watch that has been transported on two occasions, shove up someone's ass, is amazing. And very, very funny. I can't begin to list all the wonderful scenes. The opening dialogue is incredible as Trovolta and Jackson are on their way to do a hit. They have virtually no respect for human life, yet they, themselves, are very human. The date scene with Uma Thurman with the adrenaline shot. The crazy's in the pawn shop. And, the effort to clean up the car after blowing away a kid in the back seat, the issue being that a guys wife would come home and be very unhappy to find a dead body and a blood filled car in the garage. It sounds horrible and makes me sound sick. I found Fargo to be a hilarious film as well. Is there something wrong with me?",w
10,22 August 2022,Stefan_Loves_Movies,6, I didn't get it,I heard so many people claim that this movie is a masterpiece and it also has high ratings. So I was intrigued to give it a go. I didn't get much enjoyment out of it. Maybe you have to watch it multiple times to enjoy it. As for the first viewing it didn't satisfy me.,6
11,20 January 2000,Quinoa1984,10, One of the Best Film's I've Seen In A LONG Time... and still is,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. ",0
12,27 June 2014,Rainey-Dawn,7, A Bit Over Rated But Good,"I did like pulp fiction to a degree - that is mainly because I love the casting in it: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman.",5
13,17 April 2020,marcferrantejr,10, Perfect Movie,"This is my favorite film of all time. Every second of this film is engaging, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that. Tarantino's direction and script is brilliant, and every role is perfectly cast. Everything that happens in this movie has a purpose, and you don't realize it's hidden in plain sight until the final moments",7
14,13 February 2012,hitchcockthelegend,10," Ah, so by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal. Is that true?","It kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for Pulp Fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. As a film it needs no introduction, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, won a BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Tarantino), and garnered a whole host of other awards and nominations. Box office beef was meaty and its reputation even now shows no sign of waning (it currently sits at number 4 on the IMDb top 100 list), it is by definition one cool MOFO of a movie, a picture loved by a cross section of demographics. But why?",5
15,26 July 2020,flopezgraziano,10, this is a fantastic film,"Quentin Tarantino demonstrated to the world the powerful ingenuity he possesses, and of which he boasts in every minute of this one, his best film, of 2 and a half hours of duration. The real magic of the film is that its viewing is short and leaves you wanting even more, despite its length. Another particularly attractive aspect is its black humour and ordinary situations.
Everything is incredible in Pulp Fiction, but without a doubt the most charismatic thing of all is its script, dividing the facts into chapters that were later imitated in other films by other directors and repeated with other films such as ""Kill Bill"". These chapters are not even exposed in a chronological order, which forces the viewer to fit the pieces of the plot, which would be difficult to describe.
The next strong point is the very famous cast with brilliant performances that raise the quality of the film to unattainable levels. In particular I want to express my admiration for John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in their roles as thugs/collectors (Vincent Vega and Jules, respectively) with unforgettable dialogues and discussions that are present almost at all times in their joint performance.
Another ingredient magnificently introduced is his soundtrack, with great themes, besides the mythical title song, including pop, rock and soul themes (I find especially elegant Travolta's dance song with Uma Thurman, by Chuck Berry).
In short, I can only say that I find no fault with this film and that I do not bring anything new that anyone already knows about this work. Unless Tarantino does something of this magnitude again, this is one of my favorite movies of all time",6
16,13 March 2010,planktonrules,10, Brilliantly constructed.,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a brilliantly crafted film. The many separate vignettes all are quite compelling and fit together wonderfully. And, on top of that, the script and acting are exceptional. And, most importantly, the film is wildly original and very, very stylish. The only reservations I have are minor. First, while this is a very, very good film, I can't see why it is ranked #5 all-time on IMDb. This seems wildly overrated and too often more recent films seem to dominated IMDb's Top 250. Second, this film is certainly NOT for everyone, as in spots it is tremendously violent (like any Tarantino film) and should not be viewed by kids or the overly sensitive.",0
17,25 October 2022,Xstal,9, Poetry in Motion...,"A pair of assassins in search of McGuffin, unclear what's inside but it's probably nothing, employed by Marcellus to recover his debts, in the course of their work, people lose their assets; one hitman's called Vincent who likes to shoot up, not just firearms but with needles close up, when out with the wife of the boss cuts it close, as she snorts all his gear and then goes overdose; a boxer called Butch throws a fight the wrong way, Marcellus sends Vince to reclaim the foul play, but events take a turn, there's a bit of a twist, as the boss and the boxer are caught in a tryst; a cleaner called Winston removes every trace, of all that remains when you're shot in the face, and a pair of till robbers with new openings, help Jules to consider, should he do other things.",/
18,19 January 2005,discoelephant64,10, Unbelievable.,"Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it.",?
19,21 April 2020,TheHoodOfSwords,8," Fun cult film, tad overrated","Conflicted on this one. I like a lot of elements of it, the characters are (mostly) really compelling and interesting. I think some of the ""Segments"" are a lot stronger than others. I think that the first part of Bruce Willis's story is just... bland. I didn't find it very interesting or compelling. It gets interesting though. The first and last are by far my favourite, but for the most part it's pretty strong. I do think this film is slightly overrated. That's not to say that it isn't good, but I think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. The film is acted well and I enjoyed all the action, not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. I found it really hilarious. I see why everyone had/has a crush on Uma Thurman now, she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. I also remembered how much I like long shots. I think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. Overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10.",r
20,30 December 1998,Luke-20,10, One of the best movies of the century!,"If you think ""Pulp Fiction"" is brilliant, you're wrong. It's more than that. It's a milestone in the history of film making. It's already a classic. But why? Because of the many ""f"" words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't get it). Tarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of the movie is ""cool"", he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about ""Pulp Fiction""? It's the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece.",e

22,12 October 2020,aljabman,10, Pulp Fiction Is Not A Film,"It's not a film it's a experience. The characters are very memorable The story of nonlinear dialogue and action no the whole movie is fast and fun there's no down time or anything boring the movie is long. There's more then 10 memorable scenes that is referenced in any type of media. I like to think of pulp fiction as resvoir dogs another film by the genius tarrintino as a better version of it. I thought resvoir dogs had the coffe scene at the start and mr white hurting the police officer. I thought the movie was stretched out more then it needed to and the ending gave me such a poor taste in my mouth. I still like it, like I would get a poster or t shirt of resvoir dogs to show my opinion. There did you see that I lost focus that's what pulp fiction does it makes you forget about the world but remember about the experience. The scene where butch reclaims himself in the eyes of walleces is a redemption story in itself about how we can all get together without fighting and being greedy. The part where 2 scenes ( tiny bit of a spoiler but watch Pulp fiction now if you haven't) where somehow at point blank range a revolver didn't shoot Jules and vincent and somehow Vincent shoots one of the guys in the head on accident. Thats a message life is like a box of chocolates the things you never expect will happen. Another part of the idea is the violence and sex violence plays a big part in this movie these are horrible people that everyone loves when I see this film I feel like it's a LEGO set controlled by tarrintino everything goes together like cause and effect yet while still being random sex is not that big in the film expect for the epic scene where butch remdeems himself and when butch is making out with his girlfriend but that scene was still great because he had to find his watch holy crap. This movie has dialogue lots of it and that's fantastic he is known for dialogue the tarrintino himself said that dialogue is a major component in his films and it shows, other films have such poopy dialogue where all they do is talk about nothing like get on with it. Pulp fiction is the story of 3 as 1 and should be hands down the number 1 film of the millennium .",_

27,9 January 2005,wolvesrug,10, Simply The Best,"To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.",u
28,9 December 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10, One of the best films of the 90s,"What can I say? This film is amazing, and I would go further and say it is my favourite Quentin Tarantino film, and one of my favourites of the 90s. The cinematography and scenery are spellbinding, and the soundtrack is brilliant, one of the best soundtracks in a Tarantino film actually. The plot is every bit as compelling as that for Reservoir Dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. The direction is superb, as are the performances. As excellent as Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are, the film's best actors are John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson who are unforgettable. Pulp Fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox",r
29,9 April 2020,ChubbyChecker,10, If you only ever watch 1 Tarantino film make it this one,"I like to think that any Hollywood director who dedicated their life to making movies can look back at one film and think ""At least I made my mark"".

31,19 April 2020,jamiedarlow-37510,10, 'And you will know my name is the lord!! When I lay my vengeance upon thee....',"An absolute classic in every sense and a must see for anyone even vaguely interested in films! A non-linear narrative following various characters including two hitmen Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield (John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson) a mob boss Marcellus Wallace and his wife Mia (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a boxer named Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). They all have stories that are seemingly unrelated but come together subtly through their lives intertwining. It's masterful cinematic story telling, holding buckets of style while also making time to explore its characters and delve into their personalities underneath the crime plot lines. The dialogue is insanely good and the lyrical flow of it keeps you enthralled throughout. I remember when I was a young kid fascinated by the grown up world of Tarantino's films. My fantastic mother let me watch all of his catalogue apart from this one until I was older (due to the distressing gimp rape scene) and there was so much built up for when I became of age to finally watch this masterpiece. It certainly didn't disappoint and it was my favourite QT picture to date. It's rightly become a huge staple in pop culture while also maintaining serious rewatchability and classic status.

41,15 April 2020,saadanathan,8," I dare you, I double dare you if you don't love this movie! 8/10","First thing's first, this is tarantino's most original and famous script ever written. the diffrenet storylines of the characters in the movie are so great you would watch them again and enjoy them just like the first time. all diffrenet story arcs clash togeter in unexpected ways. one of the main advantages of the film is the narrative that goes all upsite down, the narrative doesn't go from start to finish and it's better that way, it's a way of tarantino to tell his story in all sort of ways and directions. the characters were well written and my favorite character has to be jules, he had most of the unforgetable lines and was a key member in the movie. the soundtrack was terrific and definitely great for the tone and genre of the movie. the actors were fantastic with samuel l. jackson and john travolta at there best in thus masterpiece. so if the movie is so perfect why give it a 8? maybe it's not perfect in all categories and maybe some people consider it only to be one of tarantino's greatest but not THE greatest. I for once disagree cuase it is perfect and surtely the best of all.",
42,16 April 2020,DemonKiki,10, Popularity and gameplay victory,"The postmodern discourse of the film, because it is in the post-industrial society era, is driven by the commercialization of the consumer society, thus embodying commercial, game, and popular colors. Jameson pointed out that the old (essentially advanced modernist) boundary between the advanced culture and the so-called popular culture or business culture has been abolished, and new texts have emerged that are full of forms, categories and contents of cultural industries. Bourdieu believes that the film has got rid of the shackles of classic art and has become a popular culture or a postmodern culture and has become a cultural capital. The purity of aesthetics and the self-discipline of art have been impacted. The tower of pure aesthetic ivory has collapsed under the impact of popular art and its aesthetics. The ensuing is the appearance of popular aesthetics, and it has increasingly gained its own aesthetic legitimacy.
Attracting audiences with popular themes, flattening the depth, everything is flat, this is what distinguishes the serious attitude of postmodernism from modernism. The result is to give the audience leisure, fashion, relaxation, surprise, and no tears. Violence, crime, sex and other generally considered vulgar themes are the themes of postmodern movies. Especially in terms of violent style, Tarantino became a single family. Violence has always been the unshakable theme of Quentin's works, and formed his black violence aesthetics. Violence is bloody, cold, game, and does not carry any moral and political responsibilities.
""Pulp Fiction"" thoroughly stylized and gamified violence. It makes the audience realize that at this moment, you are watching movies for entertainment, so Tarentino will turn violence into joke, sex into joke, politics into joke, and history into joke. It does not ask about the meaning, does not reflect, does not touch politics, not to mention resistance. The ""Bible"" quotes before Jules' killing were not intended to legitimize his murder. Similarly, the scene of Mia's overdose did not have any intention of exhorting drug addicts. ""Black"" has also been treated as a piece of joke. Both Vincent and Jules drove around the city in a car full of brains and blood. In order not to let the police find it, but also in order not to add trouble to their friends, they had to do it within 40 minutes. Cleaning the car is a very technical task, so that they have to hire a special problem-solving expert from the headquarters to guide them in their work. When the two big-hearted men finally washed themselves and the car Afterwards, while wearing two exaggerated and somewhat funny T-shirts standing in front of the camera, a scene full of blood and terror was transformed into a humorous sketch, and the popularity and gameplay are most vividly displayed here. So some people say: ""Pulp Fiction"" completed the transformation of violent movies from modernity to post-modernity, showing that post-modern violent movies have completely lost the power of social criticism, the depth and the profound connection between old movies and the real world. No longer carries the meaning of cultural symbols such as national mythology, heroism, social resistance, political complaints, etc. Some other similar cultural commitments are also taken out, leaving only the image itself. ""And the frequent scenes of violence in the film are echoing Its ""circular structure"" clearly states that the occurrence of violence is cyclical and never stops. ""Pulp Fiction"" tells us: In life, violence, including wars and boxing, is omnipresent. There is no justice in life and death, right or wrong in front of it.
Although Quentin Tarantino has never talked about postmodernism, he knows its essence. He seems to tell us that life in the 20th century is developing rapidly, changing fast and worthless.

This story is divided into four parts which is hard to conclude it with several sentences. Mr. Tarantino did an perfect job on characterization. Every person was vividly portrayed. For example, at the begining of the film, Marsellus Wallace didn't show up, but we could know from the conversation between Jules and Vincent that he is such a powerful gangster and nobody who knows him dare to mess with him. And Vincent was also shaped in different angles and details. In the movie, he is a man of humer, a good partner, and the spot in this movie which is dramatic when he killed by Butch. The movie was full of black humer and it might wants to say, nobody would be the 'righteous man' in the world of violence, but their character is vividly brought to your attention by Quentin, which makes up this high-scoring movie",

'Pulp Fiction' is Tarantino's carnival of funny, but equally abrasive nihilism. This is a film which has a surprisingly firm backbone of morality beneath the crazy and deranged surface. Tarantino is constantly on the lookout for characters who make a choice to turn their back on their meaningless lives of nihilistic violence and look for honour and a purpose. The characters who make that choice are allowed to ride off into the sunset, while the characters who decide to not change and stick to their meaningless cyclical lives of never-ending crime and violence are burdened with unenviable fates. There is a method to the madness. Tarantino makes the film and the characters infinitely rich. However while doing all this, he never stops having fun. There are endless film references, pop culture references and other stuff that signifies the film's self- consciousness which constantly make the viewer feel the fact that they are watching a film, a piece of fiction through Tarantino's eyes and not anything attached to reality.",
58,28 October 2001,cutter-12,1, A One line summary is too much for this overrated piece of #&#@!,"The movie that defines the sensibilities of Generation X. That is to say its values are worthless, the story is lurid and over extended, the writer/director is overwhelmingly self-indulgent and tacky (any revelations to do with Christianity are twisted by Tarantino to fit his obscene sense of morality), the violence is absolutely incredulous, and the originality to do with non linear plot lines and everything else is greatly exaggerated (Try watching some early Kubrick to get an idea where he ripped it off. -- hell try watching 50 other trashy independent exploitation flicks from the 50's and 60's to see how much ""originality"" Tarantino has.) I'm not going to make any friends here, as this film has obviously snowed everyone who's commented on it, but who cares. Despite some extremely intelligent and powerhouse acting from Samuel L. Jackson, Pulp Fiction is a n experience not unlike having your face smashed into a urinal by a criminally insane biker in the bathroom at a race track between race four and five. It is an offensive and disturbing trip through the mind of a filmmaker who is as far from being a genius as the Earth is from Neptune. Quentin Tarantino is NOT Orson Welles. And Pulp Fiction is a film which only speaks to a generation pre-occupied with body piercing and anti-depressants. Make no mistake, I am more of an atheist than a Christian, but even I am outraged that people find deep meaning in a killer seeing the light and turning over a new leaf by letting the piece of garbage petty crook snake out the door with everyone's wallet he has terrorized at gunpoint along with his wigged out nutcase of a girlfriend you'd just wish Tony Minero would ice. If he truly was making a spiritual point and sincerely trying to do the right thing he'd have given Tim Roth his wallet, told him to leave the bag and apologize to everyone on his way out. Off to a flawed start as a Christian. And the fact that Tarantino lets us see that Roth and Plummer's characters aren't terrible people but just actors before they pull their heist is also a load of crap. Then there's the completely sickening LA underworld psycho scene (a personal Tarantino fantasy?) to do with sodomy and a couple of hillbillies which was done much truer and to better effect in Boorman's Deliverance. Does anyone truly come away finding this scene to be entertaining? And if so , if you're ever in my town please keep driving.",

Like all great directors, Q.T. lets the film and its subsidiaries stand on their own. A lesser director might employ cheap gimmicks and plot devices to move the story onwards at a brisk pace, but ""Pulp Fiction"" is a dark action, comedy, and/or drama that clocks in at two hours and thirty-four minutes.

Today I want to write about one of my favorite and many times revised American crime thriller 1994 ""Pulp Fiction"". The director of this film is the incredible Quentin Tarantino. The duration of the picture is two and a half hours, they fly by as one minute. The cast is very strong: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis and a lot of other great actors that I love and respect. A bouquet that is necessary! I really like the work of Quentin Tarantino, his style is always very different from others, it is difficult to confuse with someone else. Perhaps this picture of all his most cool. The film has everything you need to have fun. Bright actors-stars, atmosphere, humor, dynamics, music and much, much more! This film is memorable from the first time, but you still want to review it. Everything is unrealistically cool, romantic, unusual and interesting. I look and take my breath away. I know all the dialogues by heart for a long time, they are simply incomparable! All the movements of the dance Uma and John have long learned and danced. Who hasn't tried to repeat them? In general, it is very difficult to find fault with something in this film. In my opinion, the picture is perfect! I don't see the point in retelling the plot, everyone knows it anyway. And if there are those who have not seen the picture yet, then I strongly recommend it to raise the mood and get pleasure. I hope that those who love this film very much, I just decided to remind you about it just in case. I wish you all a great mood and a lot of positive emotions. Thanks for your attention.",

style of of story telling which is virtually a Tarantino invention ! yes it is true of course, every director has his or her unique
style of moulding and honing their story , Tarantino aims his tails in a unique mix of his own well thought out concoctions .
I cannot think of any examples , but anyone who loves cinema will have seen some films that failed in their attempts to
copy Tarantino. Therefore, that statement , it seems to me , is clearly indicative that this director has always triumphed
over all attempts to either go one better than him or out fox Tarantino in the hope of overpowering his style of sculpting .
That is how uniquely brilliant Tarantino is, similar to Gaugin or Michael Angelo he is a true artist in his creations
As has already been said, to try and get some level of comprehension of this film , it needs to be seen a number of times.
The same appreciation and more clarity of understanding is precisely the reason we continue to learn more and acquire
more depth of real academic learning every time we return to the National Gallery in London or the equivalent American ,
Italian or French art galleries . Every viewing of the Mona Lisa we see something previously overlooked, or did not previously
fully understand ! The first page of training for a successful film director comes from his or her hours and hours of intimate study
of form, substance, and colour , of photography also. Kubrick began his career as a monochrome photo journalist , thereby learning
about framing and all the artistry that follows that ! Tarantino i suggest either had a natural eye and sensibility of form, or ( possibly and )
studied from a very early age, as much as he was able with regard to form, framing and colour hues ? And only at a slightly later time in his younger days started writing story lines and ideas ?",

It generally mixes ideas from lesser known films and used irrationally to create an ambiance of cool. Though this film is wonderfully cinematic, it must've been tremendously exciting back when it first premiered. I think its exploitation of violence and drugs is a tragedy, and although these consequences do lead to something bad, it doesn't disencourage them. I can't help but resent the film for the fact it's usually the film that gets people into film (can't disagree that it was one of the films for myself, but it has been 7 viewings since) since it offers absolutely nothing new, it just doesn't have a point nor is it a realistic representation of anything - not that I'd like to know, to be honest.

To say that sitting through it was painful would be an understatement, but if that isn't bad enough, it is also incoherent and confusing (at one point the Samuel L Jackson character dies, if memory serves, only to show up alive later with no explanation given).

Over the last couple weeks, with Steve Jobs and the like, we have examples of platforming failing. But it can succeed: this film is a prime example of that.",

153,3 June 2019,VS132,10," ""Did I Break Your Concentration?""","Where do I even begin? Even after twenty-five years, Pulp Fiction still remains my favorite movie of all-time. Why? Because it takes the all the aspects of what makes an excellent film in my opinion. The characters are all so interesting from the smooth hit-man Vincent, the voluptuous Mia Wallace, the intense boxer Butch, the mysterious Marsellus Wallace, the criminals Honey Bunny & Pumpkin; and the greatest performance for any character; Samuel L. Jackson as the interrogate hit-man, Jules Winfield. All of the actors shined because of the fantastic screenplay Quentin Tarantino wrote to make these colorful cast of characters come to life by their dialogue that makes you glued to the screen even if what is presented ties to the non-linear narrative or not. This is best shown nearing the end when it is shown that neither Jules or Vincent are good men by any means because they go to people's houses, interrogate, and kill them without cause; but that doesn't mean that they have heart as through their hit-men skills, were able to stop two criminals from robbing a diner. That's ingenious writing as Tarantino knows that society are full of people who aren't heroes or antagonists; there is a division and altercation within cinema and reality. Coupled with throwbacks to classic films, and an unforgettable soundtrack, Pulp Fiction will remain to impress audiences and one that I and many others; will continue to enjoy for years to come. It has such a high re-watch value despite its length!",

Everything about this film is annoying, (the presence of the ubiquitous Sam Jackson and Steve Buscemi, the weak attempts at shock value, the cameo by the director) but the one element that makes this number one on my all time worst list is the obnoxious dialogue that tries to be hip and funny.  THREE'S COMPANY reruns have better dialogue (and I hate that show). It's such a shame though, because QT and I do have a lot of the same obscure tastes in movies.

I've never seen anything like it, and I hope I never will again. This is one slop of a film, and I'm disgusted to know that it has so many high reviews. It was a confusing ball of goo that amounted to nothing. I didn't care for the characters and never will. What a hopeless bunch of freaks. I don't jump on the ""freak bandwagon"" unless they're natural ones, not arrogant embodiments of deranged entertainment. The glorification of smut is worse than the smut, and that is exactly what this movie is. The sad thing is, I don't believe that some of these actors were acting at all. They were just being themselves. Travolta and Jackson in wigs??? That was scary! The only interesting thing about the movie was the sequence of events. I like the way that it started at one point and ended in the same, but dislike everything in between. The problem with this film is that it tricks the audience into giving it great reviews. It uses the ""peer pressure"" method. You know, ""this movie is for intelligent and cool people"" CRAP!! Well, I'll gladly stand among those who know that this was nothing more than a ""shock flick"". It was produced to see if the letter could be pushed a little further. Unfortunately, it drags what little respect that Hollywood has with it. I'm afraid that this is one of the major stepping stones to a pathetic industry that only produces films for vulgar lust.",

The movie is cool and it makes you want to be cool too. One thing I have noticed about Tarantino is that his movies are very cool.

Best performance of Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta's careers as well as an amazing addition to Quentin Tarantino's Filmography. The film is darkly comedic and makes you laugh hysterically over moments that you would otherwise not find amusing. The dialogue is sharp and witty yet feels very realistic for most of the film (occasional monologues aside). The film can make characters seem like total bad-asses just by having them eat food (in this case a burger) and can make you sympathize and care about horrible people. The film is extremely entertaining with no scene feeling like it goes for too long and every moment serving a purpose in the overall narrative. It is widely inventive and there is a reason people give this movie so much praise. All fans of movies and general cinema goers need to give this film a watch at some point in their life.",
177,29 May 2019,jackamccallum,10, Deserves all the praise.,"Let me however extrapolate, embedded in a Pulp Fiction review which I couldn't care less for - on my film review style - from someone who has a media degree in film studies, and began their career wagging school at fourteen to watch French Cinema; and you know what they say about people who have experiences at an impressionable age - it sticks! I gave up on Hollywood in approximately the early seventies after Easy Rider and Zabriskie Point. I even walked out on Five Easy Pieces, even though in retrospect, that wasn't the film's fault, in those days we were keen on life and not on introspection and reflection. Though retrospection, tells me that was a good film. In fact it is the kind of film that the baby boomers now crave, good writing, and good characterisation from a period in history when just being alive was an entertainment, and not bogged down with crazy little computer screens and cowards with their wise-arse messages tweeted because they are too afraid to speak, possibly because even the modulation of the voice has been colonised by trendoids, who are so post-modern and wise-arsed they know everything; but at the head of the pack are a bunch of no-talents who have clamoured to the high ground. And that list is endless in entertainment, now: Quentin Tarantino (highlight-dialogue in Pulp Fiction, ""In Holland, they have mayonnaise on their fries."" - conclusion - lame) Johnny Depp (the guy can't act, get it? That's why Australians get Oscars now, as Hollywood is beyond knowing, who can act]; Russell Crowe (just because Hollywood couldn't get anyone else to fill out a Roman general's tunic except maybe some wooden ex-wrestlers), he wins the Oscar-but in his next movie, A Beautiful Mind, everyone gets an Oscar except him, because basically, when you play a screw-loose professor, exchanging walking around in circles for walking around in squares, it is not acting! It is a guy walking around in squares cos he worked out that was a riff on walking around in circles]; Saving Private Ryan, though I hate to admit it is a brilliant film - through its depiction of my grandfather's generation, who when I was growing thought wasn't cool; but mine who made every piece of furniture in their house to a French polished standard; as well as, the P.A. system for my Uncle's successful band including the foldback cabinets-which even The Beatles didn't have-as well as keeping a 200 acre dairy farm as a hobby. Cool, I don't think I knew the meaning of the word; but the Juden angle in Saving Private Ryan which is shoved towards the POWs by a man brandishing - a Star of David (on his dog-tags?)-as the POWs march past-I'm not buying because usually and in that war in particular - it is the politicians, the military hierarchy and their bureaucratic underlings who systematically entrench racism as a tool of their propaganda and the common soldier is generally ideologically neuter as they have to follow orders or get shot - otherwise on the western front in 1915 both sides would have turned around and marched home. But that was the only glaring error in my opinion but this ethno-stereotyping, though understandable has spilled into his other films, especially the Star Wars epics, wherein Cowboys and Indians in Outer Space in the early films becomes metaphoric American foreign policy in latter films... to be continued...",
178,4 January 2021,Trey_BigTime_Film_Critic,10, My Reviewing Style discussed via the lense of Pulp Fiction,"Simply put Pulp Fiction is the silliest film I have every seen, it puts  Battlefield Earth and The Long Kiss Goodnight (spookily starring the  two leads from this film) firmly in the shadows, they look like rare  vintage wines next to this cheap plonk. The fact it is so highly  revered by so many, and even considered profound, makes me fear for the  very existence of modern society.  There are some fundamental reasons I dislike this film with a passion,  the first being the pacing and substance, the film really mirrors it's  director to perfection, yapping and a mumblin and a stumblin from start  to finish, enthusiastically about....Nothing! If Qentin was not such an  untalented, cretinous buffoon I would call him the new David Lynch. The  only substance in PF is of the white powdery verity, the film is just a  collection of sick images splashed on screen willy nilly strung loosely  together by some sharp but pointless dialogue. The film was too crude,  made purely for shock value. When violence, male rape, drug abuse,  accidental shootings and other such fun filled things are packaged as  cool and even as comedy in the hands of an immature director you get a  highly irresponsible film, and to sell it as some sort of 'smart art'  piece is doubly irresponsible.  Then there is the complete lack of character development and depth.  There are no characters, only 2 dimensional machines created solely to  perform acts of severe violence and drop in a few wise cracks, they  perform actions in one scene that seem to have no effect or relation to  what happens in their next scene. Not one of them is even slightly  likable or in possession of any redeemable characteristics apart from  perhaps Butch (Willis), did I mention he is a violent thug, murderer  and a thief? Then there is Mia who seems to have little purpose in the  film other than an excuse to include the very uncomfortable scene where  an over weight Travolta boogies on the dance floor. Yes she is in the  'famous' needle scene as well, but what else? The section featuring  Vince and Mia was just dropped and barely mentioned again like Mia  herself, so what was the point? A question I asked of the film  throughout. I quickly realised that nobody in the film was there to be  developed, any one of them could have been dropped (apart from Butch)  or their actions performed by a completely new character without making  a spot of difference to the film, their actions were not to be the  subject of scrutiny. That would be asking too much of the Tarantino who  is clearly only interested in attempting to make stuff look cool. He is  the most unoriginal man on the planet only capable of tacky 'homage'  (ie, he is a thief) action films. Don't believe me? Watch Kill Bill  where he even pays homage to his own film, this one! I do give credit  to him in one respect. He realised that if he re-jigged the order of  plot events he could not only look artistically swish but he could  disguise the fact that the story is not worth the toilet paper it was  written on, impressing upon many the fallacy that the hack job  narrative structure enhanced the story.  The direction is experimental but quite frankly tacky and laughable at  times. One scene featuring a near comatose Butch in particular comes to  mind, the camera is stuck dead still on him while Marsellus (Rhames)  uses the m-f word 100 times in about 5 minutes, totally amateurish. The  only memorable performance is from Jackson, who could make the  ingredients list of a packet of cookies sound fun, he is offset by a  flat performance from Travolta. That brings me to the 'witty' dialogue  which, apart from the violence, is the crux of the piece. It is  unfortunate then, that this dialogue basically consists of idiots  talking a load of nonsense about such deep things as cheeseburgers,  milkshake, foot massages, cleaning up skull and brain chunks and some  coffee that is described as gourmet s**t. Some dialogue was witty but  mostly it was just utterly pointless, the characters deliver it with  such perceived style and coolness despite the fact they were talking  about, frankly, a lot of BS. Add this to the fact there is (barring  brief moments in Butch's story) no plot, no emotion and especially no  substance and you have one worthless film. ""Ah you don't get it"" they  all scream, don't make me laugh, the circular narrative and the  ham-fisted attempt at redemption at the end does not equal substance.  The ending was hilariously cheap, obviously a desperate attempt to  justify a pointless 2 hour string of images in one strike. Is it meant  to be profound? Well after sitting through the whole film which  consisted of characters that were never developed adequately, where no  actions or events were properly tackled, challenged or explored with  any great thought or depth during which I was never required to care  even once, I was presented with one of the most cheesy, pointless  monologues in film history. Oh and a parody of QT's fans - the  briefcase is opened and they stare at the shiny thing and go ""ooooh, it  beautiful"". It is all a hollow gesture when you consider the character  that delivers the speech and his actions directly following it,  combined with the entire sequence of stupid events that precede it.  Many movies these days suffer similar problems at their conclusion  because of obvious limitations in plot structure and development, some  have endings that invalidate the rest of the film, others have endings  that are invalidated by the rest of the film, with Pulp Fiction QT has  somehow achieved both simultaneously. You'll figure out what I mean. As  a rule I don't usually let a film's director put me off the film itself  but, after Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, Tarantino films are now the  exception.",
179,7 June 2005,Mighty_sheman,1," Pointless, immature and excessively crude glorified action film from the world's most pointless, immature and excessively crude man!","Pulp Fiction doesn't have a plot. Or, it doesn't have a linear and evolving plot. Instead, it is just a collection of relatively unrelated stories that include some of the same characters. However, what makes this crime movie special is these stories aren't about the dangerous life and business of a gangster, but instead about just the day to day life of people who happen to be employed by the mob. Now, at first this may seem boring and pointless, but after a closer look, you'll realize that there is one thing about these stories that stands out. The dialogue. Every conversation is unrealistically realistic. People will go on long debates and monologues about everything from french burgers, the metric system, foot massages, tasty burgers, refreshing beverages, why some guy got thrown out of a window because of a foot massage, divine intervention, good coffee, comfortable silences, and just walking the Earth. Every conversation seems like an exaggeration of a conversation you might have.

180,7 June 2022,s0apt0ken,10, The greatest movie about absolutely nothing,"Pulp Fiction is mildly amusing in parts, and in all honesty relies completely on the scene that makes the movie, from where Bruce Willis walks past the clothesline to where he makes up with the hilarious crime boss. Much like the log scene makes a King Kong movie. The scenes with Willis are livelier than the scenes with the two dull, obnoxious hit men who get way too much screen time, and put the viewer to sleep. The surface plot of this movie is pretty dull, and it's tough to care with the poorly written characters, but it relies on its ""iconic"" style of trash talk and actions. The hidden plot of this movie is the title itself of ""Pulp Fiction"". This movie has mixed allusions to different eras. Sometimes, it is the late eighties and early nineties, but more often it is the late sixties, early seventies, with the rotary phones, clothes lines, rarity of billboards, and the songs people tapped fingers to in those days. What we have is essentially a make believe world in which kids from the seventies think the world is like outside, where everyone carries a gun and is either a boxer, gangster, killer, or lunatic. The ""modern"" images are all imagined by the seventies kids thinking they'll be in such a world when they grow up. A decent idea, but it could have been done better with more interesting hit men.

Cheap imitations of Tarantino's hit began to be seen, films with more stylized dialogue, harsher senses of humour usually coupled with brutal violence became much more commonplace and acceptable in the mainstream cinema. (a prime example being Tony Scott's 1993 hit ""True Romance"", also written by Tarantino) Yet if Reservoir Dogs was a hit, than Pulp Fiction was something entirely more, snatching up the prestigious Palme D'Or award at the Cannes film festival and making a huge smash impact on movie viewers and the film industry on the whole, spawning generations of cult followers and would be imitators.

The angles are nice, the cinematography is strong, the acting is good, the soundtrack is unmatched but the most important thing this film offers is its storytelling. The story pushes itself in a way that differs it from the other Hollywood movies made at the time. It doesn't really follow a normal ""Guy wants something, gets it"" kind of storyline. Instead it barricades a more Leonesque technique. The kind of storytelling which one would see in old and mostly forgotten pictures like ""The Trio"" or ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" where the story is much more complex than a guy wanting and getting something.

When I awoke the story was back on the hit scene with Vincent and Jules still talking about quarter pounders and Big Macs. I thought the tape had rewound itself and so turned off the player. I didn't finish the movie until a few months later. Then I realized Tarantino was merely playing with time. In lesser hands ""Pulp Fiction"" would be too episodic, but Tarantino makes it all work. In the end we have a happy closing knowing that tragedy lies ahead because we have already seen that part in the middle.",

I have to say that all of the hype didn't really add anything. It wasn't very violent (or it could be that I'm just desensitized to violence, but besides one scene, I've seen worse on TV), the language just seemed to flow normally (or maybe it was because I had seen Bad Santa the day before and it had about the same concentration of language), and the drug usewell, I expected it for it is a movie about drug abusers.",

205,23 May 2022,margineanvladdaniel,7, Will the overrating stop?,"Probably Tarantino's best film, Pulp Fiction is a self-sidetracking and highly combustible film that out-does itself at every turn. Centered around several people who's individual arcs all meet at the fork in the road, the film does a masterful job of developing characters and telling a story about people striving to keep and flaunt their power. The performances by the star-studded cast are absolutely stunning and are only augmented by Tarantino's whimsical dialogue, with almost a twenty-minute sequence with just Vincent and Jules talking about nonsense. Every scene only enhances the depth of these characters, providing great insight into the personalities that make up people like Butch or Marsellus by providing a window into the way they think and interact with others. Although the jumbled time-frame can cause confusion at first, it all eventually falls into place and wraps itself up in the end, making for one interesting film. Probably my favorite aspect of the film is how it treats every character like a normal human being, foregoing the heroics and the pretense of a ""primary protagonist"" - this leaves the viewer with a film where they observe the initial position of a character and watch that character go through a set of struggles completely unique (and in some cases absolutely mental) that put their personalities and beliefs to the test. All in all, this is Tarantino's best film and shows how ditching the traditional film setup creates a film with an unprecendented form, all only to aid in its success.",

Vincent drove to the dealer house and he had to inject the adrenaline shot into her chest and she woke up and they came back and promised it'd be their secret. Butch the boxer cheated the boss and killed his opponent at the match and went to his girlfriend fabienne with an exotic Colombian cab driver. They had fun and in the morning he had to get back to their flat before escaping because fabienne forgot his fathers watch. At their flat he just saw a gun with a silencer in the kitchen and Vincent came out of the bathroom and he shot him dead and left. On his way back to the motel he saw the boss by the lights and hit him and had an accident. Butch took a refuge in a guitar shop and the boss came after and the owner dominated them and called a friend over and they turned out to be some sick guys into bondage and rape. One of them raped the boss while their slave was watching butch. Butch untied himself and knocked the slave out and wanted to run away but turned back and killed one of the guys with a sword and the boss shot the rapist in the crotch and would call people over to torture him to death. He also wanted butch to leave town that day and they're fine. With the chopper in front of the store he got back to fabienne and they left the motel. It was even better than what I expected it to be. When they killed the young men who stole from their boss Vincent and Jules killed the guy that tried to kill them but failed miserably and Jules thought it was divine intervention. They spare the black guys life and took him with them. Vincent accidentally shot the guy in the face and stained the car. They went over to jimmys house (Tarantino) and their boss sent Winston to help them out. They cleaned the car, they were washed naked and wore jimmys tshirts and shorts. At the coffee shop the couple wanted to rob the restaurant while they were having breakfast and Vincent was at the bathroom. Jules wanted to quit the job because he felt gods touch when they miraculously missed the bullets of the giant pistol. Jules said he tries hard to be the shepherd and repeated the quotation from the Bible confessing he's no idea what it's about.

217,17 March 2006,rebeljenn,7, great method of story-telling,"Quentin Tarantino presents his masterpiece: interwoven tales of a washed-up boxer, some bodyguards to powerful crime kingpin, and others who cross their path on this fateful day. Featuring an all-star cast: John Travolta in his best role (relaunching his dead career), Sam Jackson in his defining role (still trying to outdo himself fourteen years later), Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth and more. (Many of these being Tarantino regulars, who work well with his idiosyncratic style.) How do I review a film so many people have praised, including my hero Roger Ebert? I could be a detractor and say its a bad film, but I'd be lying. I love the story and how it all plays out. I still prefer Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"", but this comes in a close second. (Sadly, I don't think he ever recovered after he became famous. Subsequent films -- ""Jackie Brown"", ""Kill Bill"" and ""Death Proof"" -- all have a certain charm to them, but are not close to being on the level of ""Dogs"" or ""Pulp"".) Although I've seen this movie, or at least bits of it, a dozen times, I think the most recent may be the most interesting. I watched it with a young woman who saw Bruce Willis and asked who he was. I said, ""Bruce Willis."" She asked who that was. I listed a few of his bigger films (""Die Hard"", ""Armageddon"", etc.) but she said she had not seen them. How a woman in her 20s does not know Bruce Willis or any of his movies is beyond me, but it got me wondering: would ""Pulp Fiction"" be a different film if I didn't recognize the majority of the actors? Walken, for example, appeals to me because he's Walken. Would his monologue be as good if delivered by someone else or by Walken when I didn't know him by name? Curious thought.",

Also one my hands down favorite parts in a movie ever is when John Travolta's gun goes off in the car and he's just like ah man I just shot Marvin in the face like it was just a little slip up.

I realized how clever this movie is by watching the last scene. There is a lot of interesting dialogs which may appear pointless but they are not.

Two hours and thirty minutes just flew by and I didn't even notice it's been an hour when the first part was over. This film left me in awe and I feel like watching it again and again and again. People say this is overrated; well it sort of deserves it! So this is all opinion and the only fact is an event in the movie. -------------------SPOILER LINE---------------- So our main characters are Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson). These characters are two of the best in the whole history of film and they deserved the Oscars they got. Our villain is umm... Since there's no exact villain, this film gets the bonus. Our supporting characters are Butch (BRUCE WILLIS!), Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman), Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer), Pumpkin(Tim Roth), and Marcellus Wallace(Ving Rhames). All these characters play into the film perfectly. The genre of the film is crime, black comedy, and thriller. Well there was crime, at parts I was laughing my ass off, and some parts, my heart was beating so fast. There were no boring moments in this film. The story is told out of order. We start in a Diner and end in a Diner. So I'll summarize the story in its real order. Vincent and Jules get a case containing ....... and then they accidentally kill someone in their car so they have to clean it out. Jules thinks about retiring while the diner they're eating at is held up. Jules stops the robbery and go to a bar where Vincent gets his assignment from Marcellus Wallace. He takes Mia Wallace out. She gets overdosed in drugs. And the rest is spoiling the story. So, I give Pulp Fiction, one of THE GREATEST FILMS OF ALL TIME, 95% AWESOME! The highest rating so far!",
225,29 June 2009,ryanaustinf,9, An example of a cinematic masterpiece.,"There's just something about Pulp Fiction that makes it great. It took me a while to figure it out, but I think I found it. This may sound weird, but I think that it's the upbeat message found deep within the movie. What is so upbeat about a story involving 2 hit men (Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta) who kill at 4 people during the course of the movie, a crooked boxer who promises to take a dive (Bruce Willis), and a drug pusher (Writer/Director/Average-at-best Actor Quentin Tarantino)? It's not what they do, but how they come to their decisions, the major decisions that they make during the movie that a hopeful vibe comes about. Take the characters Vincent (Travolta, in an Oscar nominated role) and Jules (Jackson) as two under-armed hit men. After the two whack 3 rookie drug dealers, then accidentally shoot their inside man, each goes off their own way and ""save"" someone, both metaphorically and physically, and in doing so, are saved themselves, again both in the physical and metaphoric sense of being saved. The aspect of Pulp Fiction most remember is the script. Things are said by Tarantino's characters that had not been said in movies in years. What would normally be cut out by antsy editors are left in here to give the characters depth, add humor to the movie, and gives the audience something to remember. Who forgets the first scene of the movie after the opening credits, where Vincent and Jules discuss hamburgers in Europe. Or the Bible verse sermonized by Jules before he goes through with business. And of course, the music selections made by Tarantino are almost as important as the script or the actors. It is said that Quentin will pick the music for his movies before he writes the script, it is that important to him, and he uses this extra ""character"" in the movie pitch-perfect. The opening credits employ the use of ""Miserlou,"" which has become synonymous with Tarantino and features songs from the 60s and 70s to add more depth to each character. We know the Jules is a funk fan, as he chooses to play ""Jungle Boogie"" in his car, and that Mia (Uma Thurman) is adding an undertone of sexuality by playing ""Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon"" while entertaining Vincent. This scene comes after ""Son of a Preacher Man"" welcomes Vincent into her home before the big date at the 60s restaurant where we get to see Mr. Saturday Night Fever dance again. The lure to Pulp Fiction comes from the sum of the parts. The acting is great, humor comes from unexpected places, notably in the final act with Harvey Keitel's man who cleans up problems, and the music all add up to a good movie. The underlying sense of hope is what gives Pulp Fiction it's stature as one of the great movies of the 1990s.",

As I said in my ""Reservoir Dogs"" review, the man is hopelessly plot driven, which means that he can't create a story in which events naturally happen, so he has to MAKE them happen any way he can. For instance, it's bad enough that in ""The Gold Watch"" he creates a pathetic excuse for Bruce Willis to have to go back to his apartment, but then how could he make it so that Willis is able to outwit John Travolta, who is waiting there for him? Have Travolta idiotically leave his machine gun on the counter while he is using the bathroom! Come on! And then in ""The Bonnie Situation,"" how could he make the accident in the car happen? Have Travolta completely unnaturally rest the gun on the car seat over his shoulder while he talks with Marvin! And Tarantino introduces the Wolf only for him to give Travolta and Samuel L.

Tarantino got Roger Avery and Tony Scott on board but after a few months of writing Tarantino realised that he had to direct the full thing. He adopted novelistic techniques such as non-linear structure and intertwining narratives to craft the astounding story of two robbers, two gangsters, a gangster's wife and a boxer.
The film is a glorious ""F you"" to conventional storytelling, there is no plot but somehow it manages to pull you into a world of witty dialogue and horrible violence. There isn't a moment in this film when I fell bored, after each rewatch it always retains the same joy I had upon my first watch.
Not only is the film great in of itself but opens up a whole different world of cinema I had no idea existed. It's because of this film I discovered Jean-Luc Godard and Federico Fellini, it's because of this film that I found the treasure trove of Roger Corman's Edgar Allen Poe adaptations which then led to me finding the cult classic Faster Pussycat...Kill Kill! This movie managed to have so many references, without every feeling contrived, that there's probably still some ones only known to Tarantino himself.
Although the directing is top-notch there is no doubt that writing is the star of the show, Tarantino manages to go off on tangents about burgers, feet and five dollar shakes without ever making a dull moment. Tarantino says the Sicilian speech in True Romance is the best of writing he has done, but for me every line of this film beats that speech.
Not only did this film have a profound impact on audiences, but it also greatly affected directors and writers at the time. Pulp Fiction did for 90's and 2000's what Easy Rider did for the 70's, stuck the middle finger up to ""normal"" films and decided to go in a completely opposite route. Pulp Fiction completely changed movies after that. Guy Ritchie came about,adopting the same intertwining story technique and the same sense of humour and we must not forget Amores Perros and 21 grams all amazing films influenced by Pulp Fiction.
The affect this film has had on the audience and film in general is why I value it as one of the greatest movies ever made (and is also why I watch once a month, I just can't help myself).",

I suppose I was expecting something along the lines of ""Rashomon,"" which was probably setting my expectations too high.  There are three story lines (two and a half really--the Tim Roth-Amanda Plummer story is not sufficiently developed), only one of which is really interesting: the final story, revolving around Bruce Willis.  And that story takes up maybe one-quarter of the movie.  The remainder is filled with the John Travolta-Uma Thurman story line, which would have been interesting in the hands of a more talented writer or director than Tarantino.  The most interesting character is Keitel's--a great movie could be made of him, but he is on screen for only about ten minutes.  Tarantino does a nice job of exploring the ""banality of evil, but the ""hard-boiled"" dialogue is more often artificial and embarrassing, and when he runs out of expletives, he resorts to violence.

It is long before the film takes off to a new never before level of movie making the visual brilliance of the scenes and stories The intertwining of the different tales into each other the choice of order and the eventuality of being let back to the beginning makes this for me one of the all-time greatest films and from the very first viewing knowing this is going to be one of the worlds greatest directors. so many amazing performances career defining roles for stars at the top of there games actors aided by an amazing script. which still to this day is timeless like Reservoir dogs before it how to tell when it was supposed to be set what year? which just helps to make the film still perfect 30 years later.

It's a very fun watch, hence the 5 points out of 10 I will concede it. But yet it is void of any meaning whatsoever and benefits from a contemporary society that will erect any piece of meaningless junk into a grande piece of art solely on the basis it is 'original'. Originality on its own is no virtue. There needs to be purpose, meaning, a particular sense of coherence and overall an intelligence to it. All things this movie surely lacks. The script is quite awful and tries hard at being edgy and memorable for how random and 'original' it is. This film is constantly patted on its back for being structurally and cinematographically complex and 'original', but that never makes up for how skin-deep and hollow inside it so clearly, evidently is. Acting is good, and it's pretty diverse; a succession of little stories somewhat interlinked. A good watch for purely entertainment purposes, but nothing more. And certainly not a masterpiece.",
300,18 May 2016,Horror-yo,5," Extraordinarily overrated, but a fun watch","Pulp Fiction: Quentin Tarantino's second film. Is it just as rich and mighty as Reservoir Dogs? Yes. This time, a budget and a cast come along for the ride, a ride that's chopped up into four stories circling a handful of people. There's a mob boss, the mob boss's wife, a boxer, a pair of raucous gangsters and a couple who resemble the contemporary Bonnie and Clyde. Now, you need to look at Pulp Fiction as an adaptation of a comic, and less as a linear story. There's no broad plot, only a smattering of small stories linking the oddballs on display. Surprisingly its style works wonders. Its cool, edgy, bombastic and just as outrageous (if not more) as Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman make the biggest impact with personalities hard to beat. The dialogue is heavy, but witty and clever, the soundtrack glorious and the movie is wrought with memorable scenes. Mentionable moments include Thurman and Travolta's dancing, Jackson's reciting of a passage from the bible, and Travolta's accident. Tarantino proves that his first attempt at filmmaking wasn't a lucky one.",

PULP FICTION continues what Reservoir Dogs started, and proves that Quentin is indeed one of the best and most original directors ever. Who else could write three attractive totally different stories, and get them together into a thrilling 3 hour movie that will not even allow you to breathe? And probably the best part about the movie is the dialogue: fast, ingenious, exciting. Perfect. Two guys, John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson, almost screw up a job they have to take care of. A boxer, Bruce Willis, just before a fight in which he's asked to lose. Two thieves, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, deciding to rob a restaurant. Take these three stories, put them together in a bowl, and shake as much as you can. Result: a brilliant film. A big-size puzzle that will make you think.

I don't even find this movie very cool even though it might be worth a watch just cause it's like no other movie. But the story, the substance of the movie is very thin. Tarantino is for me not a very good director. Sure, some of his movies are OK, but mostly he overdo it on many occasions, which makes it hard to takes them seriously.

When I went to a Film Production class I eventually dropped out of, the professor and a classmate where like how can you want to be a film critic and have not seen Pulp Fiction and would always ask me you seen Pulp Fiction yet everyday. Pulp Fiction is set in the early ninety's and tells three stories of characters played by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis to name a few. As the film started I didn't get it but as we went through the first two stories I started to get the gist of it. If it weren't the first few weeks I was in that class I wouldn't have noticed the shots in the second story where John Travolta and Uma Thurman sitting down in the diner how the shots are equivalent to each other and don't change too often. The films a product of the nineties with its music but my favorite scenes is those silent moments like in the diner or in the last story where a man in the bathroom comes out starts shooting at Vincent(John Travolta) and Jules(Samuel L. Jackson) and it stops they look and you know whats bout to happen. I love how all the stories leave on a note like whatever happen to these two or whats going to go on next, it doesn't just give you an answer. Pulp Fiction is one of the great giant achievements in filmaking and in film history and I can see why. The stories are fun to sit through and all the shots from director and star Quentin Tarantino are amazing and the cast is very memorable.",

There are 3 stories, each revolving around L.A crime.

Yet others took the bizarre line that no film should be made about such 'worthless' characters. Yet others called it 'plotless' and 'formless'. However, a careful viewing of Tarantino s film should reveal that , like most of the ""pulp fiction ' on which it is based, it is indeed profoundly moral.

Why does Quentin cameo in the movie? Why are there gay cops. I've seen Death Proof, and thought it was SPECTACULAR. I don't know why everyone thinks this is so great.

Anyone can string together a bunch of violent, disjointed scenes, designed to shock and disturb the viewer. Violence, in and of itself, without context and pertinence to the story, is the tool of no-talent scoundrels masquerading as filmmakers. Such, unfortunately, is Tarantino. What a shame for Travolta that this was his 'comeback' film. For me, the only watchable part of this film was the sequence featuring Bruce Willis. Even that, though...how Willis was convinced to be in this film is a mystery to me. Cameos by Emil Sitka, Christopher Walken's brief part, and Harvey Keitel's appearance cannot save this self-indulgent and troubling example of a director gone wild, suffused with the sense of his own talent.

I saw this movie three times in the course of one year, and I still have such fond memories of watching it. It was around the time I got serious about cinema (about two years later) that I felt I needed to give this another go. I'd discovered the works of Bergman, Tarkovsky, Godard,etc, and felt a connection with film in ways I hadn't before, and I wanted to see if the movies I loved before still held up. I had every intention of loving ""Pulp Fiction"" just as much as I did back then, but I didn't. There was nothing there, no core. All the things I'd loved about it were gone. That clever dialog? Referential nonsense that gave no insight into who I was watching or attempted to expand the narrative. The great characters? Indistinctive cardboard cutouts that act as mouthpieces for Tarintino. Fantastic storyline? A pseudo throwback to film noir that can't decide whether it wants to take itself seriously or be intentionally stupid for the sake of irony. Gripping violence?

What is the fascination with seeing ears cut off or needles jammed into people? I sat through it and must admit there were some positive things worthy of note. I did laugh at some scenes and John Travolta's performance was his only good one since the 70s. My 3 pts out of 10 are for: 1)Samuel Jackson with the hamburger 2)the absolutely ridiculous story by Christopher Walken and 3) the absurdity of Keitel coming in to clean up the mess.

358,9 April 2005,Science_Fantasy_Guy,10, Tarantino's masterpiece,"Pulp Fiction is one of the worst blights on American Cinema anyone could conceive of. Tarantino's enthusiasm for the awful films he loves to rehash is amusing, and his dialogue snappy and funny, but he is not a great filmmaker and his films are not great films. Him and his films get by on retro-mania, smugness, and arrogance, and will date as horribly as his source material has. Tarantino is symptomatic of everything that is wrong with indie filmmaking in the nineties, and nineties youth culture in general. Cinema, and the world, could have done without him.",
359,9 January 1999,mick-30,2, F this movie.,"Sam Peckinpah is a movie director from 1970s known for the strong dose of violence in his films. ""Dirty Harry"" series from the same era played by Clint Eastwood were not deprived of a good dosage of brutality either.So are ""Scarface"" and ""Body Double"" of Brian Da Palma from the 1980s. In all the above however, there was either a plot or a theme or at least some atmosphere with a musical score. On the other hand, lacking the essentials of cinematography, the violence in all Quentin Tarantino signed stuff is so excessive and over exaggerated that it becomes simply pointless and void. A young couple takes on a journey and start a spree of serial killings just for the fun of it as in ""Natural Born Killers"". One of kidnappers approach teasingly the abducted cop and slowly slices off his ear while singing and making dance gestures as in ""Reservoir Dogs"". Still in this one, a big fat black man is being forcibly raped by an effeminate looking blond man while in the next scene a man entering the room carves up one of the captors with a sword. Still in another scene, having been shot in the groin, a man groans with pain holding to his blooded genitals. Now I don't see where is the fun of in all these. More important, where is the art in all these so that almost all Q.T brand films have earned such high ratings ? Apart from the frequent humdrum dialogs such as ""yep"", ""yeah"" , ""right"" and a lot of profanity and abusive remarks, what is the idea behind? That violence and sordidness have become an integral part of American society ? Well, after all that is their choice and they have to live with that, but at least don't sell this crap to elsewhere. If you watch historical or war films or genuine mafia/mob genre by masters such as Scorcese or Dilaurentis or Coppola, blood and gore unavoidably creeps in. However, there is a lot more than simple violence in them unlike the vulgar and infamous Q.T make. I might sound a bit outdated by our modern society standards, but somehow I don't fancy that type of meaningless brutality and gore committed by tacky small town psychopaths in confined settings such as warehouses or obscure small shops or drab U.S highways.",
360,24 June 2008,cem92003,1, Excessive violence to cover up artistic default,"""Pulp Fiction"" is an American film from 1994, so this one has its 25th anniversary this year and the director here is of course Mr. Quentin Tarantino, who made this film around the age of 30 and it was his 3rd filmmaking effort already, although most people have not really heard of his first work and only know Reservoir Dogs from his very early years. Anyway, this one here is the one that not only brought him a Palme d'Or, but also introoduced him to and kept him at the Oscars for years, no decades to come. Until this day, in fact. So lets take a look at what is most memorable about Pulp Fiction. I think last night was maybe the third time I watched this movie and the first time at a theater. It's a really long film at over 2.5 hours, but it does feel shorter for sure and that is almost a given as this film is still in the imdb top10 hightest-rated movies, currently at #8, but it was even top5 a few years ago I think. Anyway, by now it's been rated by 1.7 million voters. Enough said about the movie's popularity. So many have seen it.",

In this novel overall structure, every story in ""pulp fiction"" is told coherently. What's neat about pulp fiction's narrative structure is that it overturns the conventional notion of linear time and space without losing a large audience by being too experimental.
In pulp fiction, violence often goes hand in hand with black humor, and black humor can be surprising and unimaginable, but what makes pulp fiction unique is that it depicts the Christian faith. The film was cut to pieces by the director to cover up the truth that people should have faith.",

I first saw it when it came out in 1994 and as I watched, couldn't understand why the other people in the room (my friend and her parents) were not outraged like I was.

My least favorite is the one centering on Vincent (Travolta) and his ""date"" with Mia (Thurman), the boss's wife. In my opinion, it detracted from the crime-related tones in the other storylines, yet it was still wonderful. The acting from the all-star cast is perfect, all around. I only had one problem: Travolta. Several other reviewers state how wonderful he was in this outstanding role. Personally, I didn't think it was that remarkable. I've never really like Travolta and that may have been a factor. The real actor in this movie is Samuel L. Jackson, as a philosophical hitman--but then again, he's good in everything.",

So many people complain there is no storyline. Bullshit. If you were actually paying attention to the film you would find that this picture was divided into different segments and switched around. Just because it's something different than what you're used to doesn't mean it's bad. It's called a ""non parallel plot."" Famous authors and filmmakers do this all the time, you just may have not noticed. Quentin Tarantino just takes it to another level because he has a very unique style where he likes to give you major cliffhangers and start the next substory, making you crave for more (an you do get it, just later on.) If anything, its a series of several stories, and the film is edited the way it is to show how these different stories intertwine.

377,24 April 2016,El-Kapitoshka,9, Mashes the viewer to a pulp.,"Thiz movie is known as the most talked about movie of the decade. The movie receives a lot of good reviews from most critics. You must see it yourself then you will understand why. ""Pulp Fiction"" is starred by many famous Actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and many more. It's directed by Quentin Tarantino who is known for his eccentric works. The plot is unusual, but very intriguing in a strange way. The script made by Tarantino himself. It's kind of confusing in the beginning, but it becomes better and better as time goes by. It moves forward and backward along the movie with attractive flashback sequences. The thing that made thiz movie so special is simply those elements. You must see it over and over to understand the idea. However, actually the plot is just an ordinary plot, but the editing made it extremely extraordinary for overall. The other factor that make thiz movie unforgettable is the dialogue. The dialogue is mostly long but colorful, rude but exciting. Thiz movie is actually made with limited budget, but it's still loaded with many big stars. Thiz has proved that the Actors know for sure there is something very special in the script. The other memorable scene that you will never forget is when the dancing scene of John Travolta and Uma Truman. The dancing is phenomenal. Most people remember Travolta for his 1980s musical movies such as ""Saturday Night Fever"" (1977) and ""Grease"" (1978). Today, when we see him dancing again with his present figure, you can feel in that very moment, something magical is happening. That is the fun part. If you like indie movie, you certainly must go to see thiz one.",

So let's start off with the one negative which is likely the most common issue for those who don't like the movie. It's not action packed and it's not gory like kill bill or django. But what this story lacks in action sequences it more than makes up for with unique dialogue, completely original story (and story telling). When this movie ends and you turn off the TV it leaves one pondering about life and the choices we make. Everyone in this movie learns a lesson; whether or not they get lucky or learn them the hard way. You'll be able to sympathize or empathize with a vast majority of the characters (a few stragglers aside). The non linear chapter set up for this movie might leave one confused at first, but you have to observe each segment as their own movie then try to connect the dots (harder to do than it sounds). To this date there has not been a role that fits Sam Jackson as well as his character in this movie. And even though the last chapter is technically not the ""ending"" it works much more as such. I would not consider this an action suspense film; I would feel better calling it a very dark comedy. But if anyone reads this review all the way through and hasn't watched it yet.

And people here and there would mention the title pulp fiction to me and not sure why I just didn't bother to watch it till it was free on demand with comcast and was finally left in awe pondering the meaning of life for probably 30 minutes afterwards with the tv turned off. The dialogue is what sells this film along with the acting. And there are those that claim it is ultra violent and while there's some moments it's nothing like some of his others. The acting is amazing and I realized I wasn't watching a movie it's truly just an experience. This is the type of movie where you don't pop it on with a group of friends or a loved one just hanging out, it's meant to be observed, listened to, digested.
