0,1 December 2017,classicsoncall,10," ""...it's not how you fall that matters. It's how you land.""","After watching this film I reflected back on a whole host of films I've seen produced by Warner Brothers back in the Forties and Fifties, having to do with the subject of poverty and how that can lead to crime and lost lives. In a lot of cases, civic and moral dilemmas could often be resolved with right winning out over wrong in the end. In today's world, 'right' often comes up empty handed, and often there's a fine line between differentiating the good from the bad. In many cases, moral equivalency enters the picture, and we're left to distinguish between bad and less bad. It doesn't make for a hopeful situation.",/
1,22 December 2013,gogoschka-1,10, The most relevant French film of the last 20 years,"'Mean Streets' in french - and so much more. While there are so many references to Scorsese that you could almost call it an homage, this French milestone deals with the disillusioned youth who live in the outskirts of Paris in such an elegant - and honest - way, that I would go so far as to call it the most relevant French film of the last 20 years. But it's also a cinematic masterpiece and great, often hilarious entertainment. Everything fits: the musical choices, the outstanding performances by the 3 main characters, the beautiful cinematography and flawless direction. And, perhaps most of all, THE perfect script. ",r
2,18 June 2020,kosmasp,10, Circle of ... hate,"This was released 25 years ago, but still feels relevant. Especially with what is going on in America (once again), with the killing of George Floyd. Now the movie does not concentrate on Black Lives Matter (the movement did not exist back then), but focuses on police brutality, a seemlingless inescapable path french youth in certain areas was facing (probably still are facing).",e
3,17 May 2002,Bogey Man,10, Great achievement. One of the most unforgettable Euro movies of the 90's.,"La Haine aka Hate is a story about three friends living near Paris in France (one Jew, one Arab and one black) who have nothing special in their lives and try to live a day at a time by drinking and having a good time and also working (at least the black character, who owns a boxing hall). Their friend, however, is captured by a police which tortures and maltreats him so badly that he is sent to a hospital in a critical condition. This makes the youth gangs in city including the three protagonists start a war against the police and authorities for the horrible wrongs they and their friend have suffered, and suddenly they notice the whole society is collapsing, and all there is is hate and need to revenge...Violence and mayhem is almost everywhere, including authorities which should do nothing but fight against it..",v
4,2 May 2006,dbdumonteil,8, the most important thing isn't the fall but the landing,"""La Haine"", probably one of the most momentous French movies of the nineties caused a stir when it opened in 1995 so much so that it became a big social phenomenon. It heralded a genre: the ""film De Banlieue"" whose backdrop is high-risk French suburbs and in its wake, other movies emerged like ""Bye-Bye"" (1995) or ""ma 6-T Va Crack-Er"" (1997). ""La Haine"" remains Mathieu Kassovitz's best moment. Afterwards, he didn't cease to disappoint me. ""Assassin(s)"" (1997) left me uncomfortable and queasy and ""les Rivières Pourpres"" (2000) was an absolute turkey. I haven't seen ""Gothika"" (2003) but he shot it with the Hollywood presence on his back and I fear the worst.",i
5,6 August 2007,Sergeant_Tibbs,10," ""La Haine""; Mathieu Kassovitz' stark social study of violence, fear and hatred, remains the powerful masterpiece it was in '95.","In 1995, Mathieu Kassovitz wrote and directed a film that showed the controversial truth; ""La Haine"", which translates to ""Hate"", a film deemed so important the then-prime minister Alain Juppé arranged a special screening and ordered his entire cabinet to watch the film. Kassovitz rightfully won the Best Director award at the Cannes festival for his film that had and still has a huge impact on French society. La Haine mixes ethnics to emphasise the overriding importance of solidarity against the police. In my opinion, the greatest film ever made. A cinematic phenomenon so close to my heart.",e

7,14 February 2002,hard2xplain,10, this concerns everyone,"Moviemakers when filming French based films have traditionally tended to sentimentalise the people' through the celebration of les petits gens, the little people of Pagnol and Clair as well as more recently the fantastical Parisian wonderland environments of Amelie and Moulin Rouge. With La Haine, young director Mathieu Kassovitz took the flipside of this and gave an illustration of the awfulness of life in the depressed blue-collar areas of Paris",/
8,30 May 2002,The_Wood,10, Blew me away 10/10,"Out of nowhere this film came along, blew me away, and left me begging for more.  A totally original and brilliant piece of work by writer/director Mathieu Kassovitz -- Hate is one of the best films I have ever seen. Vincent Cassel gives a draw dropping performance, but the real star of this film is the dangerous screenplay.  Few films have left me in as much awe as Hate.  A must see.",r
9,7 May 2007,zetes,7, Didn't do much for me,"Good, but somewhat overrated. It's a French Do the Right Thing, which is its biggest problem. It apes Spike Lee so much that I don't think it ever finds a voice of its own. Plus, its three protagonists, Vinz, Saïd and Hubert are all pretty despicable. Am I really to feel sorry for these guys when they've been insulting and assaulting every person they run into? Kind of reminds me of the American film Kids, too. Sure, the film is, I assume, steeped in honesty about its characters. But that doesn't mean I feel sorry for them in the end. The film is very well made, if a little self-conscious about its freshness. Doesn't surprise me much that director Kassovitz went on to make Gothika.",w

There have been at least 300 ""accodental"" deaths at the hands of the French police. The current President of France considers the minorities in France to be ""scum.""

12,10 April 2002,Mat the masta,10, how can you sum up a film this beautiful & slick,"I first saw this film in 1997, after seeing and reading reviews about it on tv and the net for a couple of years. I never thought a film could actually make you truly think about things around our world, not just how bad it can be in places like the projects set in the film. I could truly see this happening where I am from(Rochdale,Manchester,UK).",1

15,5 September 2008,Quinoa1984,10, best film of its year; pure urban horror filmed in unflinching and poetic eyes,"Matthieu Kassovitz shot out a wad, so to speak, of the kind of ""issue"" movie that had brawn and balls and didn't back down from showing the truth on all sides, and how it's all ultimately ugly and screams for change to happen. How much the film might have changed things in the ghettos of Paris I'm not sure, and possibly it didn't do much. But as an act of cinematic awareness to a grim situation with bravura drama and humor and in the guise of a ""youth"" movie, it's completely captivating. What's strong about it is not just that Kassovitz wont turn away from the cyclical nature of violence between the young citizens brutalized and the cops 'battling' them back causing the ensuing riots, but that nobody is shown as being really right or wrong... Maybe that's not entirely true; La Haine was made for a purpose, through visionary direction and outstanding performances, which is to shed light on something that without any awareness would go on unabated. It's basically like Mean Streets meets Battle of Algiers, if that makes sense.",2

17,12 October 2022,loganschainker,10," So Far, So Good","La Haine may just be my favorite foreign film of all time. Right up there with City of God and Oldboy. La Haine is a very hard film to categorize. It's serious, but not too serious to the point of calling it a drama. And It's funny but not funny enough to be a comedy. It is my number 1 recommendation for anyone trying to get into foreign cinema. Or ""French New Wave"" if you will. Because it's short, yet thematically rich and masterfully filmed. There are so many homages to Martin Scorsese and Spike Lee. La Haine has remained immensely relevant every since it's release in 95, with its beautifully haunting depiction of a crumbling society. Remember, ""It's not how you fall that matters, it's how you land.""",/
18,10 June 2020,zzhhhqing,9, Cruel Story of Youth,"In fact, they are not bad. They still have the same simple language and peaceful behavior as their ordinary people. Except for their bravery, they rarely take the initiative to attack other people except the police, even if they are extremely extreme. disdainful. They also have a lot of cowardice in the face of the police pursuit, they are also fleeing, and when they are caught, they also try their best to suppress their emotions. Even after holding the gun against the little bastard's head and trembling and struggling, he still lowered the muzzle rationally. If there is no policeman in the end, the shot of the policeman is just a gesture of gestation and fantasy in his mind. They also don't want to go to jail, they are afraid of killing, and the anger that spews out thinly has not been transformed into a hot-headed impulsive behavior. They must burn everything in an instant.",?

The movie depicts a day in the life of three young friends from the French suburbs, who experience the aftermath of a violent riot.

I put on the TV and all the scenes reminded me off the best movie ever made in Europe, and the best on the subject...La Haine The first time I saw the movie in 2003, we was gonna watch it for school. At first I thought it was gonna be another french movie about a young french girl that got pregnant(we watched a lot of those in French lessons)...but what followed was probably the most defining 90 minutes in my life.",f

Why do things become so pent up, that the only solution to the ill-feeling is a violent eruption of chaos and violence? In post-war Britain, probably the worst of what immediately preceded the events that unfold in ""La Haine"" occurred in 1981 and 2011, when communities and often entire cities burnt for several days with conflicting explanations as to why. Conclusions are often reached along racial; economic and moral grounds - might all play their own part?",=
24,2 September 2008,jzappa,9, High-Quality Delivery of a Story of Significant Cultural Importance,"Since his hard-hitting debut, Mathieu Kassovitz seems to have become caught up in Hollywood and Hollywood-style action adventure projects, entirely unlike his debut. However, this entrance, La Haine, is an intense time-tabled portrait of three very identifiably characterized young friends in an impoverished multi-ethnic housing project in the aftermath of a great riot. Exceedingly powerful French flamethrower Vincent Cassel, who plays a Jew, is filled with rage. He sees himself as a gangster ready to win street cred by killing a cop, and molds himself after De Niro in Taxi Driver. Saïd Taghmaoui is a cheery and chatty Arab who attempts to work as peacemaker and tries to find a balance between his two friends' reaction to the world around them. Hubert Koundé is a black boxer and drug dealer. Most quiet and sensitive of the three, he sorrowfully contemplates the ghetto and the surrounding spawn of hate, wanting just to escape the degenerate atmosphere of brutality and hatred but lacks the resources. The three actors play characters who share their first names, which is an interesting touch because it is a quick and easy way for them to familiarize each other to the extent of being tightly bonded friends, as they address each other reflexively even in front of the camera. A friend of theirs has been brutalized by the police after a riot and lies in a coma. Vincent finds a cop's gun lost in the riot. He vows that if their friend dies from his injuries, he will use it to kill a cop.",t
25,4 February 2012,RaveReviewerzzz,1," Dull, dreary and pointless","After all the good reviews and as a fan of European films I was so much looking forward to this film - but I ended up being so disappointed. The film was supposed to be set in the aftermath of the Paris riots but for all the film portrayed it could have been after a bit of rain. There was no sense of anger, loss or hopelessness - just a bunch of young men moaning and brooding. These men were so unsympathetic I lost any kind of concern for them very early on. To me they just seemed a bunch of me, me,me victim-mentality that is all too common now. The dialogue was trying to be real and urban but it just came across as stilted. Anyway this film drones on and on without any plot twists, change of pace or building of tension. The obvious ""tragic"" ending couldn't have come soon enough for me. I am sure this is a case of ""emperors new clothes"" and most of the people who say they like it are just saying it. Not a patch on ""irreversible"", ""City of god"" ""Im not Scared"" etc",t
26,7 August 2005,remko_theking,10, Excellent,"This film is in my top 3! it is that simple... I have seen this movie over and over again, because it's just that good. the 3 characters (Vinz, Saïd and Hubert)act superb. even tough the movie is in black and white, it enhanced the movie. the main story of the film is just great, a real sub-urban style. furthermore it is a very powerful non-Hollywood film and that is an extra bonus. watch this movie and you'r hooked for life haha :).",_
27,24 September 2003,rbverhoef,9, A great movie,"'La Haine' is a great French movie, a lot better than most US movies that deal with this issue. The movie is strong and feels like a real story with characters that could exist. The acting and direction is terrific, the story is very good (we follow the three main characters for only 24 hours) and especially the black-and-white cinematography is great. 9/10.",u
28,22 February 2006,MaxBorg89,10, French cinema at its most shocking!,"Bold, violent, provocative, La Haine is a remarkable, mesmerizing achievement, a raw punch in the face. Few other movies are this socially relevant, and if you want to learn something valuable, I suggest you watch this film. It was made in 1995, but has lost none of its strength.",r
29,31 October 2015,Seraphion,6," Great bits and pieces, but not solid as a whole","This movie nicely presents great elements one can find in a movie. The cinematography proves to be a great treat for the eyes, displaying nice plays of pan and zoom at time and also genius camera angles, especially at the long shots. The scenes also prove to be really strong, although in essence they actually depict only simple and everyday life activities. Yet as a whole I feel that the movie didn't present a solid story. Yes the theme, proclaimed vividly in the title, gets to be ever present all throughout the movie. But between each scenes there seem to be less coherence and lack a bigger picture to connect them as a whole. Furthermore, the ending comes very much abruptly with the subject being stretched just prior to it coming. The acting overall feels very nice. The trio of Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kounde and Said Taghmaoui presented a very nice acting work. Their relationship seems very natural and fluid, especially with those long dialogs. Also their interactions with the surrounding look convincing.",v

More relevant than ever, it has not lost any of the power of its message and having been shot in black and white it has maintained a timeless character. Highly recommended.",
31,19 July 2017,pere-25366,10," A film that bristles with style, authenticity and a general bleakness","For all the violence and despair shown in ""La Haine"", the film doesn't offer any solutions nor hope of improvement. As Vinz, one of the three ill-fated men at the centre of the story, says: ""it's (the story) about a society on its way down. And as it falls, it keeps telling itself: ""So far so good... So far so good... So far so good."" There must be conviction in such words and the characters in ""La Haine"" seem to know they're in such dire circumstances, which are presented to us as almost inescapable for them.",
32,20 December 2016,Leofwine_draca,5, Shines a spotlight on social issues,"LA HAINE is a well-regarded cinema verite-style French film that follows the misadventures of three youths over the course of a single day as they tangle with rival gangs, vengeful police, and various weird characters out on the streets. It's an entirely low budget production, shot in black and white, that's chiefly of note for being the film that helped propel Vincent Cassel to stardom. Certainly he burns up the screen here with his usual intensity and never disappoints.",
33,14 September 2017,aleksandarsarkic,5, A bit overrated,"La Haine (Hate on English) is definitely one of the most known French movies from the 90s. Directed by then very young Matthieu Kassovitz it shows one day in the lives of three young people from Paris suburbs. Somehow La Haine is considered cult movie in my home country Serbia. It is popular even to this day. I think that young people from Belgrade suburbs start to identify themselves with the life of characters from the movie. It was very similar here for young people especially in the 90s but didn't changed a lot to this day. I have watched a lot of movies to my now 30 years but i always skipped La Haine and watched something else, i think that is just because the movie is popular within my country and i never trusted the taste of my fellow country-mans. And i was somehow right, i finally watched it and my impressions were half-half. I like the acting by Vincent Cassel and other actors, like the movie is recorded in black and white, but something is missing, there is no deepness in the movie, director didn't show the real reasons why the people are living in that hard conditions, we only see how they kill their time in the hood and some of their small committed crimes, and of course there is constant animosity between people from the hood and police, but maybe that's it, the feeling of emptiness is similar to hate. If you want a movie about life in the hood and how three guys killing their time and fight with the police watch this one, if you want something deeper and with more atmosphere and character study watch something else. My grade 5/10.",
34,19 June 2020,h-28658,8," Seemingly about nothing, yet quite gripping.",There's a downside though - don't think the movie has the message it thinks it does.,
35,30 November 2009,film-critic,9, How can a film made in the 90s still resonate in the 00s? Ask Kassovitz!,"""La Haine"" is a political film. ""La Haine"" is a humanistic film about the realities of ghetto life. ""La Haine"" is a film about France, specifically the turmoil surrounding rebellion, honesty, and sacrifice. ""La Haine"" will anger you. It will make you cringe in your seat. It will make you question the values within your own community. That is why this film swept in 1995 when it was released, why other directors have attempted to recycle the story, and why even today - 14 years later - it still remains a relevant film, not just about French society, but a dedicated relevance towards American society as well. Director Mathieu Kassovitz has pulled this story directly from the headlines, taking the injustice of the police and the corruption of the streets and transforming it into the lives of three multi-national boys hell-bent on initiating revenge for the sake of their fallen friend. It is a dark story that uses drugs and violence off the scene to build the suspense within. Filmed in a stark black and white, Kassovitz takes away the glory, wealth, and American-ized culture of project life (see Baltimore's ""The Wire"") and allows us to experience one day in the life of these boys and their discovery of a gun.",
36,20 July 2020,MarcoParzivalRocha,9, To my top 5!,"24h in the life of 3 young men, from Paris suburbs, after a day of tumults. It entered my top favorites, it's just incredible. The narrative is the perfect example of a broken society, consumed by hate, racism, xenophobia and feelings of despair and exhaustion. Everything we see seems natural, the dialogues are as genuine as possible, and the build of the characters is almost flawless. The photography is revolutionary (for the time), especially in French cinema, that was more conservative. It transports the viewer to the action in an incredible way, and the black and white helps to reinforce that feeling. The fights between friends and the tension helps to reinforce the friendship and love that keep these guys together, no matter what.",

This is not Mean Streets but a couple of lame dudes who would have been beaten with bats had they lived in Brooklyn or Bronx.

Why is that so ? The decision to exclude La Haine from DVD space is due to the fact that France is the only nation in the world which relies heavily on its past glory.In our modern international world,it still talks of Moliere, Balzac etc knowing fully well that no one (at least French youth) is interested in them.France has nothing latest,recent,modern, contemporary to showcase to the whole world.French language books are always devoted to its writers,singers,new wave cinema etc.There is no chapter,no description of its immigrants,ghetto life and racism. Whatever that has been depicted in this film is the naked burning reality.Such was the impact of this film at the time of its release premier Alain Juppe had to call for a special screening to know what all the fuss was.One final word:three male leads:one Arab, one Jew and one Christian, isn't that bit intentional as well as obvious.May be Kassovitz wanted to reach as many communities as possible.",

Inspired by other masterpieces such as, Do the Right Thing and Mean Streets, La Haine is a French film taking influence from American, urban cinema. Just like the two films I have previously mentioned, La Haine is a ferocious film, fuming with a controlled rage which will resonate for hours after your viewing. To this day, I can still vividly recollect my first-viewing of La Haine. I was completely taken-a-back by the experience and left in awe at what I had just viewed. Not only this, but I quickly realised I had watched one of the most poignant social-commentaries to hit modern cinema, a film which was so honest and reminiscent for today's society.",

Don't you just HATE it when some arty Parisienne decides to remake KIDS without the sex, and REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE with bad hair? Isn't it particularly galling that an American cable TV network prefers to show this pale fictional precursor of FRUITVALE STATION instead of the real thing? What's not to HATE about a flick shot on grainy 16mm black-and-white reels from Grandpa's attic with some random thugs forced to do ""community service"" in front of the camera? Didn't Albert Camus say that Hell was when some hack doodler tried to ride piggy-back on the Tragedy of our Times by splicing stock footage between thick slabs of improvised gibberish, then calling the result a fish sandwich (if you get his anagram for ""carp"")? Is there really any ""bleeding nun"" joke that a decent person could hear without scornful HATE?",

What appears to be spontaneous and natural, is actually carefully conceived and executed. To top off this great technical achievement is a cast rendering memorable performance.

Because this film isn't just looking at the situation in Paris or in France it's asking what happens when a country ignores a whole mass of people. The answer is presented through our three lead characters, Vinz, Said and Hubert each from a different background but all living on the same estate in Paris. Neither of them are bad people, but with no one to guide them, the only things they are know are drugs and violence. The situation is exacerbated by the brutal actions of the police which further alienates the three from society.

If 400 Blows is about how society has failed children, then La haine is about how society has failed its teenagers and young adults. The protagonists of this film are played by very talented actors, who expertly convey the desperately aggressive poor suburban youth. This portrayal might have gone too far though, as their attempts to make a name for themselves leads to many moments which make them unsympathetic. Despite the hostility of their surroundings, it is still hard for me to connect with characters who would probably steal my car if I ever met them in real life. The nine stars are for the skillful atmosphere, with bleak cinematography, dirty mise-en-scene and talented actors contributing to a realistic portrayal of a society falling to its death. Its major weakness is its plot, as it seems like a lot of meandering that does not really go in any particular direction until the end.",

65,27 August 2022,garethcrook,8," A damning account of a violent, ignorant society fuelled by male insecurity.","La Haine is the first French film I remember watching. When released in 1995 it was a genuine underground hit. It was seen as cool and edgy. I've seen many French films since and many much better French films, but La Haine still remains a cinematic triumph. It's brutally hard hitting. A bunch of young men in the midst of Parisian riots and unrest, a premise set up with archive footage in the opening credits as Bob Marley sings of ""burnin' and lootin'"". It does have an almost documentary feel in places, but what makes La Haine so engaging is truthfully a long list, one that's probably poured over by film students, it's that kind of film. Social commentary spliced with gorgeous cinematography, razor sharp shots knocked back in a high contrast black and white. It's beautiful, especially considering what's been depicted. Riot vans, callous police, graffitied sprawling estate walls and three friends bursting with vitriolic energy. Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui), Vinz (Vincent Cassel) and Hubert (Hubert Koundé) are the drivers of a narrative packed with male bravado. Hanging out, idolising gangster films, angry and eager to riot against the police brutality that's put their friend in a coma. Hubert is a boxer, but he's also largely the sensible one. The balance to Vinz and Saïd's more posturing nature. Saïd is mostly all mouth, but Vinz, well he's hellbent on earning what he sees as respect and when he finds a gun lost by a cop in the riot, he sees his chance. Cassel was the breakout star of La Haine and it's easy to see why. He commands the screen in a way that really overshadows the others, which is saying something as there's no weak link here. This might be down to Vinz being the loose cannon. He's the hardest to read. The tension very slowly ebbs and flows throughout the day as a ticking clock graphic keeps marking the time of trigger point events. I can't say it's an enjoyable film or even that it plays as well nearly 30 years on, but it's still an arresting 90 minutes and sadly still feels as relevant as ever, with the sort of finale that feels perfectly fitting if not satisfying. A damning account of a violent, ignorant society fuelled by male insecurity. DSome things don't change.",

69,11 September 2006,karl_consiglio,8, A French bomb,"A French bomb that blows a hole through all the images of berets, baguettes, cancans, cafes, Deneuves, Delphys, Depardieus and French film from Jean Renoir to Jean le Florette, which has at times rather tiresomely persisted in projecting. This is France's answer to Scorsese and Spike Lee. ""This is the story about a guy who falls off the top of a 50 storey building(or the Eiffel Tower),"" recounts one of the film's heros.""As he is falling, he is telling himself,'So far, everything is fine....so far, everything is fine' But in the end he has to land."" Kassovitz tells the story of that descent through 24 hours in the lives of three friends, a symbolic trio of Black, Arab and Jew. Hubert, Said and Vinz are homeboys for whom home is one of the countless suberbs outside Paris, The housing estates, shoe boxes or pigeon holes if you ask me. They are members of that singularly exclusive class which Presisent Chirac labelled les exclus: unemployed drifters who hang out, get high, steal the odd car, deal the odd deal. Their friend Abdel is on death's door after being beaten during a police interrogation, a night of rioting has ensued and now the cite is in a state of siege. And now it is Vinz not the Cops who have the gun, lost by one of the riot police during the insurgence. Stumbling upon it has transformed atimid teenager who ""feels like an ant lost in an intergalactic space"" into a swaggering Titan, rumescent with power, a rebel with, at last, a cause. This is black and white cinematography, bursting with rhythm, almost schizophrenic in its scope, this is La Haine and a hugely effecting film it is. Frozen in boredom and slow motion shots of Hubert hitting a punching bag, all gleaming sweat. An accelerated montage of the frantic mob backed by Bob Marley's music that turns banal televised violence into a massive mournful, comunal dance. the rappers do a different kind of dance, and the camera ups the tempo chasing jumps and pirouettes of such energy and artistry that seem to resurrect a thousand lost hopes. edgily it follows that the three friends who play, joke and provoke because although they are street wise, finally they are only boys and there jokes are about farting and sex. the gags dry up when the boys arrive in Paris. The city's famed charms are lost on them, they are hopelessly alien as the hordes of American tourists, scorned by the girls they try to pull and finally brutalized by a sadistic interrogation officer whose hard-on swells with every blow. The screen screen fills up with a terrible close-up of a face rabid with hatred. It is Vinz, tentatively, fondling the ever present gun, its a chrome-plated Smith and Wesson 44. Vinz is hallucinating about using it on the next cop he passes by. Vinz at the movies, holding up his face to raining images of violence, inviting them to drown him and at the same time empower him. Vinz and a recurring mirage: a lone cow grazing in the cite's concrete fields. In the end, it is Hubert - the trio's voice of reason, the mediator, the one with the most tolerance and faith and the greatest moral sense - who is most inhabited by hatred. the gun is in his hands. The shot reverberates. The screen goes black. The audience does not know who has been shot. and doesn't care. Because in the end, the audience too is inhabited by hatred. This is the story about that falling man....",

71,12 October 2015,nicolechan916,7, An intense atmosphere and story with good acting.,"I find it interesting that the film uses the names of most the actors as their character names. Perhaps by doing so, it adds more of an authentic feel to the film. The trio (Vincent, Hubert and Said) have good chemistry on screen, and what really ties them together is Said, as Vincent and Hubert are constantly butting heads; one the angel and the other the devil. Said plays the cheerful innocent young boy without much of a care and does not take sides with either, trying to maintain the peace. Vincent's expressions are really intense and though he does talk of violent acts, he does not engage in many. Hubert thinks of the bigger picture and with his calm demeanour is the image of morality in the film. The trio can be seen as gangsters by the way they walk and talk and the influence of American hood films is apparent here.",

You can tell that since the beginning. When you get a series of black and white images of riots, with Bob Marley's ""Burnin' and Lootin'"" as the background music (a perfect choice, certainly), you know you're into some serious stuff. Indeed, this movie deals with strong stuff: it's about a group of three friends who live in the suburbs of Paris, France. The word ""suburbs"" is certainly highly associated with constant crime, drugs, and riots. Our characters are in the middle of all of this, influenced by all of this. ",

If you've seen it before you know that you will watch it again at some point. I must have seen it five times by now and I still love it as it was the first time. Most of my generation saw the movie when it came out and now this movie is passed on from generation to generation. It's a movie that is at it's best when you fully understand the French language, aspecially the street language ""verlan"", that means à l'envers or backwards, a language that's been spoken by mostly youth thugs in the suburbs. The movie itself is a view of the harsh life in the suburbs in France, a life without many opportunities nor things to do except hanging around with your mates in the ghetto. The hate towards the police is normal and justified as they are seen as pariah. The movie, shot in black and white, is a must watch, even with subtitles, it still works. Vincent Cassel in his early years, it's something to watch. Like the rest of the cast, it all works perfectly to create that special atmosphere from La Haine.

78,7 June 2023,I_Ailurophile,9," Sharp, vivid, and all too bleakly relevant","It's not necessary to read anything about Mathieu Kassovitz's immediate inspirations for making this film, nor is it necessary to know his own stated history of having participated in riots and protests. To be an adult of any demographic in the latter half of the twentieth century or beyond, and even slightly aware and self-aware, is to recognize how this movie is all too realistic, not to mention stark, vivid, and underhandedly bleak. In fact, while I expected that it would be depressing, and it is, this is so in a slightly different way than I anticipated. For even though our chief three characters are undeniably hotheaded and boorish, mostly Vinz by far, the horrible truth is that any ""projects"" of public housing and urban development are all but engineered to fail, oppress, and perpetuate a cycle of poverty, violence, and incarceration. More than that, while 'La haine' is not kind in its portrayal of police, frankly I think it's safe to say that it's overly generous; so-called law enforcement in real life is characterized by even more brutality, harassment, corruption, irresponsibility, and abject cruelty than even Kassovitz deigned to show or suggest. The result of all this is that even for any tinges of levity that may crop up this 1995 picture is not one that's readily described with terms of positive connotation like ""enoyable"" - but seeing as that it's as sharp and biting in its construction as in the story it has to tell, it's unquestionably superb, and very satisfying as a viewer.",

80,5 May 2022,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, Hate breeds hate.,"Set in the highly-charged aftermath of a bout of police brutality, 'La Haine (1995)' tells the tale of three unruly teenagers who contemplate their place within the racist and classist system they're unwillingly a part of as they await news of their coma-stricken friend. The film renders its core characters incredibly realistically, affording each of them a distinct emotional reaction to the events around them and building their relationships with one another in surprisingly nuanced ways. The three leads feel like real friends, bickering and bantering their way through an anger-inducing situation. The flick builds its own unique brand of suspense, making good use of foreshadowing and an almost intangible sense of portent to constantly keep you on the edge of your seat. You feel immersed in its volatile world, as invested in its socio-political landscape as the characters who are most affected by it. It's remarkably realistic, its crisp black-and-white cinematography mimicking the news footage it opens with, and it's equally as compelling. There isn't a dull moment, which is all the more impressive considering that this is the sort of film that draws the oft-inaccurate criticism of ""nothing happens"". It makes you laugh, then it makes you cry; it furrows your brow, then it drops your jaw; it makes you happy, then it makes you sad; it warms your heart, then it breaks it in two. It really knows what it's doing, conveying and inducing a plethora of hard-to-express emotions while telling a simple but effective story. Thematically, it's incredibly resonant; it impeccably balances its subtext with its text. Overall, it's an affecting experience that keeps you engaged throughout. It's still keenly relevant to this day, which makes it all the more essential to watch. If hate breeds hate, love must breed love.",

82,26 July 2011,Red-Barracuda,8, Social-realism with cinematic style,La haine characterised a 90's strand in French cinema where there was a focus on depicting contemporary social issues. A particular point of interest was the banlieue; this is the suburbs of Paris where the working classes were moved to from the 1950's onwards. These housing estates in the outer areas of the city were made up of high-rise blocks and the quality of accommodation was poor. This segregation of the working people from the higher income brackets led to an alienation that was felt especially in the younger generations who only knew this situation. La haine looks at three young men from this very context.,

85,26 December 2022,dromasca,9, 'why do they hate us?',"'La haine' - 'Hate' is one of the most appropriate titles of movies I've seen lately. Many times, faced with violent social events, demonstrations and protests, we ask ourselves: 'why do they hate us?'. The question is not new. Written and directed in 1995 by Mathieu Kassovitz, the film can be considered a warning about the desperate situation in the Parisian suburbs and especially about the hopelessness of an entire generation born and raised there. If we are to go by the events that happened in France in the 27 years since the film was made, the situation only seems to have gotten worse and more complicated. The film's heroes, three young people from a lost generation (or one of the lost generations) seem to be animated by a declared hatred of the system, unadaptable and hostile to the world in which they live. What are the roots of this feeling that dominates them? Is there any hope or option for them other than the personal and social disaster that seems to be their destiny? Without giving definitive answers, 'La haine' suggests them. It does it with the artistic mastery of the fine filmmaker who would become Mathieu Kassovitz and with the sincerity and involvement of a young man who was only 28 years old when he made this film.",

Three male youths, Vinz, Hub & Sayid represent the multicultural aspect of poverty and desperation found in the projects. Kassovitz captures the boredom with amusement, aided by the creative use of the camera. When the going gets tough the camera jolts you to awareness. But you can never relax when the boys are having a laugh because anything may and can be around the corner, giving you a sense of perspective of their unpredictable lives hanging on razor's edge. Only when the boys venture to the outside world does the film lose its edge, slowing the tension down and showing how the other side differs no less than the projects when it comes to racial intolerance.",

They are, between run-ins with the police very entertaining: Said trying to get his hair trimmed was hilarious, his voice raising ever higher as he panics about how much has been shaved: The three guys trying to steal a car, with the aid of a drunk passer by are fine and funny moments. But these lighter interludes are shattered by hints of dire things to come. The cops roughing up Said and Hubert is horrid to watch and as the film progresses you can feel a sense of doom coming closer. The encounter with the skinheads for me was the moment you know the ending was not going to be good and then boom. It takes a lot for me to physically feel something from a film, but as that gun fired into Vinz, I shivered. The ending alone is enough to put it into that high impact category, but as a whole it is a still relevant piece about social conditions and the suffering caused by them.",

The escalating friction between these trapped civilians and policing forces notoriously allowed documentation of blazing riots to take place. Vandalism, bodily harm and even death. Society free-falling into violence that would shake, not just the country, but the world. Kassovitz' monochromatic drama may just very well be the most naturally realistic drama ever put to film.

Many people were scandalized by this film, stating it is too violent, too crude... neither is the case. It is one day in the lives of three teenagers in a dirty, dangerous suburb of Paris: Hubert (an African), Saïd (an Algerian), and Vincent (a Jew), and how they survive in a very hostile environment, where surviving for the next few minutes is the only thing you can look forward to. This is one of the greatest screenplays I have recently seen, and I think this film resembles many of the classics in many ways. Mathieu Kassovitz did a wonderful job directing, with shots that clearly resemble any major director (Hitchcock for example). Another great thing about the film, the editing... the story is very nicely put together through the editing.",

106,24 January 2002,ad_rock,10, The world is ours.,"The film La Haine is considered to be one of the most controversial, powerful and innovative films of the 1990's. It won the Best Director award in the 1995 Cannes film festival and won film of the year (1996) at the Caesar awards. La Haine (which in French means 'hate') was considered innovative because it is part of a very underused style of French cinema called 'Un Cinema de Banlieue' or 'Cinema of the Suburbs' which depicts the grim reality of France's run-down suburbs. Other films from this genre include 'Etat des lieux' (1995), and 'Bye Bye' (1996).",

The novel follows the life of a Igbo tribesman and his kin as they adjust to the arrival of Christian missionaries and struggle with the impact of British colonial rule. It's a great book that illustrates Western cultures' largely grim history towards ""less civilized"" societies. Better still, Things Fall Apart is not liberal white guilt shrouded in anthropological verses; it's a book that attempts to accurately portray things as they were and as they eventually became. The main character Okonkwo isn't a mindless barbarian nor a noble tribesman but somewhere in-between. Hubert, Vinz and Said, the main characters of La Haine (1995) (roughly translates from French to Hate), are much like Okonkwo.

If you like to ponder the metaphorical resonances of a film, this is the one for you. If not, and you'd rather watch something for pure entertainment, maybe give La Haine a miss.

The film was shot in black and white, on a very low budget, using many non-professional actors.

Basically, a plotless flick, which depicted this french underground very authentic and you're just enjoying the life of three guys, who want to shoot a policeman. That's it, but it's wild, it's very frenetic, and not a single second is useless here. The visuals are very nice and especially that drone shot with DJ in the background is incredible. I wanted maybe a bit more from the characters and their problems and struggles. I enjoyed it anyway, and that ending is mesmerizing - had chills everywhere, instant goosebumps. So yeah, very happy that I watched this because on Letterboxd, pretty much everybody loved it and I'm a bit sad that I didn't love it that much, but that's that.

155,10 July 2016,hikerhetav,8, Make sure you land up meticulously before catching your seats.... watch it for sure!,"Hate begets hate and ignorance leads to fatal. 'Hate' and 'ignorance' are two pillars of racism which we observe today while its foundation was laid far years ago. The main question arises while watching this story is, first, ""What exactly are we facing due to the effects of racism?"" and second, ""What urges us, we common people, to get trapped into the maze of racism?"" We have been living in the world of togetherness and unity with a motto of 'oneness for all', unknowingly of our society which is still diseased by the plague named 'racism'. We don't observe, while we are in our own peace, that someone superior to us is injecting a fluid in our hearts that is developing more and more hatred for the ones who are either of different casts or of different races. 'La Haine' translated as 'Hatred', directed by Mathieu Kasosvitz is very firm on the issue of racism and is by far the most occupied film ever made on the subject. The story set in the city of Paris is righteously motivated through its director and cast. Watching this, it rarely makes one feel numb and pity towards the crew; and it is as rough as it gets as emotional we feel in the end. I was stunned to see Vincent Cassel in his early days, how beautifully he has crafted his work in the form of acting. In ""Irreversible(2002)"", he was mature enough but less bold than in La Haine. Hubert and Said Taghmaoui have played their roles brilliantly. Said is another face to watch throughout the film if you enjoyed Vincent. Each of them being young, they have been so perfect and artistic, one may never find such acts in other French movies. Pierre Aim is another brain on whose shoulder, cinematography was staged. And guess, that leaves us spellbound to see very different angles of Paris. This is not all for we see this movie. We got to take something back after viewing this, we ought to apply positivity we gain from it.

Then again, we humans are extremely imperfect, our every decision needs some form of prejudice or HIERARCHY-al-lise-ing meant. But this film should be, and is, put at NUMBER 1! At least for younger people. This is the simplest, jew boy, black boy, arab boy parable ON THE BEST DOPE EVER SMOKED. BEST SHOT EVER - look for Edith Piaf mixed with NWA (YES, f*#$ the police) FLYING OVER THE FRENCH GHETTO. Did I mention the BEST FILM SHOT EVER, (not counting the entire 'Russian Ark'). This film also takes the distinction of making Black and White film not only worthwhile, but the best choice. (Those that singularly prefer B&W are sentimental fools - ""when men were men, and film making was FAR MORE ELITIST than it is, even today"".) La Haine is the ONLY film to see before you die. Unless you are gay and then you'd better also see 'Brokeback Mountain' and if you are super gay, 'Prayers for Bobby'. No kidding, certainly no Homophobia, I loved those two films as well. But am I being far too influenced by 'Family Guy', persistent gay jokes? Probably not, Seth McFarlane DEFINITELY has something repressed there, and me, I was the classic, ""Gay guy with a straight guy hiding in the closet"", post modern freak show: 'Mum, I like Trannies.' 'Yes son. See that you understand how difficult it is for her, with the operation, they suffer a lot of trauma.' 'YuuuuuuuuuuuK. OPERATION, Mum? No way!' Making a fist that comes from the elbow embedded in the pelvis. 'I don't want no ""girl"", post some mutilating operation, mum.'",

158,2 October 2020,meurernick,7, Other Countries Suffer from Police Brutality and Discrimination,"First things first, I find it very intriguing that this was directed by Mathieu Kassovitz. The first thing I saw Kassovitz in, was Amélie, a very happy film to say the least. Little did I know, six years before that, he made this movie about police brutality and discrimination in France. Being from the United States, I usually do not hear about other countries' issues with the police. That may be me just not paying attention/looking in the right places, or a lack of coverage, but this opened my eyes. People in other countries deal with the same issues we deal with in the states. I think this movie was fascinating in it's symbolism of the policeman's gun. At one point, Saïd says to Vinz, ""with that piece, you're the big man in the projects"". It is a symbol of power. Also, the character change in Hubert was also very good. He started out as wanting nothing to do with the gun, to possibly being the last one to fire it in the movie.",

La Haine is one of those movies that is flawless, but less talked about. Most notably, the ending is surprising, mainly because there are not many actions or twists prior to that.

Not to mention their tensions with the police, their dreadful living conditions in an almost dystopian area of Paris where crime is abundant and deadly riots have led to many places being burnt down and/or brutally vandalised (e.g. schools and a shopping mall).",

165,12 February 2005,Cineman187,10, Not such a Beautiful Paris,"From the burning intensity of Bob Marley's 'Burnin an lootin', up till the subtle yet painful ending, this film can boast with every right to be in a league of its own. French director Mathieu Kassovitz helped to escalate the growing problem of rioting through police brutality right up to the doorstep of leading men in the world of politics. The film has three main protagonist, all gelling their own unique personalities into the structure of the film to add a sense of diversity and interest. Following the routine lives of three disillusioned youths over the course of 24 hours, we are given a verite style insight into the social underclass of a Parisian housing estate or projects. This is a bold film that basically invites the viewer to watch just like Hubert describes as a ""drive by zoo"", and in return feel for the characters. The basic premise of this film is found within the tragedy a youth a few years before this film was made; a teenager who was beaten to his death in police custody helped to influence and propel this film's genesis. It is this event, which acts as the soul of the film, and is also the reason why it seems so real. Raging rap music by Cut Killer - Supreme NTM, allows us to see the inhabitants of the projects vent their anger at the loathed police, and the music also mirrors the personality of one particular individual; Vincent Cassel takes the role of Vinz, a French Jew who seems to be so exasperated all of the time we are simply waiting for him to explode. He is a vibrant character and practically epitomizes the term 'Hate'. When we see Vinz aim his Smith and Wesson in the face of a cop (simulating), he does it in such a cavalier fashion that we see just how screwed up his mind is by the social problems that suffocate him. His friend Said is quite the opposite of Vinz, while being quite a nonchalant character he does seem to accept his position in society with more composure and shrewdness - he doesn't go around flaunting a gun like his friend Vinz does. The final central character is Hubert, who is of African descent, and clearly being the wiser, more prudent of the three. Compared to Vinz and Said, Hubert's anger is inconspicuous, and he manages to channel his aggression. Vinz's hatred on the other hand is so perceptible that he usually brings trouble to his friends and Said never feels to intervene. The camera work of this film needs to be appreciated for it is quite stunning and every scene justifies its inclusion - to complement the hatred that is ever - present. The film culminates in the most provocative and powerful manner, where by the end of it you just know this film is on to something important. Kassovitz shows us that he is a rabid director and a dedicated man who simply wants to raise some serious questions. With it's Verlan dialect, daring, bold and imaginative cast and crew, this film delivers in the most fascinating depiction of police violence, ethnically diverse teenagers and social economic problems. I Strongly recommend this cinematic masterpiece of modern day film making.",

I attempted to watch it without subtitles as my French is usually good enough to enjoy TV & film without, but I soon realised that I was missing too much due to the rapid fire slang and Parisian sub-cultural references. I would say that the English subtitles are a great help for following the story, but they do not really do an adequate job of conveying the linguistic style, grit and wit of the film. This is a shame because this film should be appreciated by as many people as possible! One thing I particularly liked is the use of the background as plot elements.

177,2 November 2015,timothy_480,8, An original piece that pays tribute to its art form,"The story of La Haine is not so clear from the outset. What is this film about, who are these people, what are the rules of their world and why? These are questions that I was asking myself for the first half hour of the film and then I realised that the film is not going to blatantly give me the answers as I'd expect. Instead it's going to slowly unravel them, intriguing me every so often and making me feel smart when I work something out. And that's exactly what happened. I found the story and plot to be fairly original in the sense that we haven't seen this type of story telling before this film. The shape of the dialogue could have been inspired by the likes of Tarantino but it stands on its own. Although the film can deal with brutal themes at times it is very comedic. There are little references to other films as well allowing the viewer to feel clever when they recognize them. The only issue with the story is that it is obviously a story for a specific audience. Not much context around the world of the characters is given making it difficult for westerners to feel sympathy for what the characters are going through because they simply don't understand the gravity of the situation.",

180,20 July 2004,cameronclan57,10, A film Scorcese would be proud of to make - Exceptional,"La Haine for me was the pinnacle of how a film should be put over in it's true message of intent in a political sense. La Haine is a brutal, bold but simple film, which intelligently interweaves between three unique individuals.Highlighted throughout are the burdens and painful encounters with the much resented Police, but most of all themselves.The hatred that engulfs this film is found within one certain character 'Vinz' who breathes and speaks hatred everywhere he goes. The directors intention of this film was to give us the viewer a more prominent knowledge of the pain that many poor Parisians live in. Kassovitz does not want to confuse his viewer nor does he want to make us think simple thoughts of it. Instead he wants to make us think for ourself and let our imaginations see the anger and problems which face these people. In some peoples opinions La Haine is reminiscent to Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing', to me though La Haine is more. Lee's film is very one sided and although racial abuse comes from both sides the film does not give the viewer a concrete choice to follow. La Haine on the other hand shocks the audience into having no choice but to sympathize with Vinz and his peers. When you look around at their bleak and desolate existence you must think to yourself ""what would I do in their position?"". If you can see beyond the typical genre of mindless 'hood' films then you will come to realize that this film is a political statement that has the sole intention of changing this world. Once you have seen this film it is up to you to either carry on you're life not caring or actually feel some aspect of condolence for these people, if you do so then at least this film was not made in vain. While we interweave within each character we become manifested in the hatred and mental tiredness in which the films characters experience. La Haine gives a stark implication of how life really works for the less fortunate; Hubert had the chance to walk, Vinz was damn unlucky and Said was the helpless bystander. Vincent Cassel is vibrant and very believable as a man who is portrayed as a living time bomb. Hubert Kounde puts in an exceptional performance as a man intent on punching his way to freedom. Said Taghmaoui requires less ability in his role but he plays the character very well providing the balance between the other two characters. The finale to this film simply enhanced it's power over me as the viewer, intense and thought provoking it was. For this strong feeling I plead with you if La Haine has not yet been viewed by you make sure you watch it. It is brilliant masterpiece, which is amongst the most poignant films of it's nature to be brought to our screens. ""How you fall does not matter, it is how you land"" will always be something of a strong reminder that for some life is a never ending circle of pain and hate.",

What's really good about this movie is how close to reality it takes you. The characters are simple, they could definitely be your average neighbor, i.e. not especially good-looking or smart or with any kind of hidden gift. The storyline itself honors that: sometimes we see nothing happening around the characters, nothing at all, for minutes.

Mathieu Kassovitz faces deep themes concerning human identity in contrast with a degrading society fuelled by hate. the title haine actually means hate, throughout the movie we witness hateful actions, hate against the different, hate that flows like blood in our streets and our souls. The movie means to show that our society is auto destructive, in fact it starts with a spoken quote ""as a man is falling from a building he says to himself .so far so good, so far so good. the problem is not the fall, it's the impact to the ground:"". The director uses this idea and puts it in a metaphors which is the story . The story takes place in Paris's projects during an ordinary day in the life of three friends Vinz, Hubert and Said each with a different personalty that react in their own way facing Society. the plot's growth represents a time bomb, time after time events worsten till we arrive to the end when the bomb explodes...BOOOM!! Another theme in the movie is the contrast between dream and reality. the main characters face events out of the ordinary (cow sighting) that are opposed by reality surrounding them, reality brings them back to earth and their illusory beliefs such as the vengeance of Vinz and Hubert's desire to escape. the events that follow each other contain a great unofficial magical realism influence, After a whole day and a night pass away composed by a dreamy and mysterious atmosphere; the morning comes and the harsh reality hits back making the bomb explode with the sure death of Vinz and the presumable of Hubert that it is obscured by the ending. Behind Grumwalski's story another theme is hidden which is relativism; every belief and faith an individual has is completely useless cause this life does not believe in you, and it is a complete absurdity without sense.

214,26 July 2004,oscarpye_jeary,10, Get this film Kidz,"This is an excellent film and i would (and constantly do) recommend that everyone see this film. I saw this film 2 days after i'd seen Larry Clarks Kidz and the two are often compared since they came out at the same time and are both tragic tales about poor disillusioned youth. However i thought Kidz was utter cak compared to La Haine. La Haine had a better story, better characters and vitally a better director. La Haine, like all great films should be, is a work of art, written and directed by a man who'd decided that he wants to make every shot as good as it can be. I'm not one for gritty realism. The sort of dodgy hand held camera/ documentary look because i've seen it a thousand times an i can do it myself. Some claim that it gives the film more gravitas or that it makes the statement bolder but i can see no film that makes its statement bolder through great cinematography than La Haine. Its a nightmare shot like a dream. ",
215,9 September 1999,farzadb,10, One of the best (most important?) movies of the 90's,La Haine is a realistic and gut-wrenching look at life in a Paris suburb/ghetto. I have never been so bummed out at the end of a movie as I have at the end of this one. Every scene is tense and built up beautifully. I couldn't get myself to take a breath during the last sequence of the film.,
216,29 November 2008,edward-jost,10, Greatest film ever!,Really good film that I caught on accident after getting home from the pub. Vincent Caselle is great and the rest of the cast are superbly chosen. All in black and white plus subtitles but don't let this put you off (if this is the kind of thing that might put you off a film). Sound track is also grand.,
217,14 June 2013,mikael-ostberg,10, Intense and so very real! A Masterpiece!,"""Reality"", would be the simplest word for me to describe the main theme of this movie. Surely it depicts social, economical and racial factors but furthermore this is an analysis of human behaviour in its rawest form. Hate, anguish and sadness all correlate and it is my belief that these emotions have never been so clearly shown in a picture. I believe that any respectable, may it be American or European politician has to have seen this movie. It is filled with truths that are nothing but extremely valuable. It is relatable in so many ways; may it be because of the acting or simply because of the ""heart aching"" storyline. Contrary to preceding reviews I feel it is important to emphasize the way this film focuses on feelings of injustice, ""HATE"", and the power embedded in them. It is my belief that this movie is the most relevant of them all when it comes to portraying present realities and I challenge anyone to state the contrary. It is not only agonizing but revolting. I am myself of french, Swedish and algerian origins. Watch this movie and learn.",
218,18 October 2000,Julien-18,9, Is that this movie with a cow in it?,"This movie was, five years ago, when it came out, the most incredible snapshot of the French youth. The story is perfect : the heroes do nothing! That is exactly the point, French youth (I mean the one that lives in such buildings) has nothing to do, and this reality, that is quite sad, is frightening to.",
219,9 April 2009,chrisdenial,10, Rude Awakening,"What does one need to put a magnificent story into real act, to release a set of encrusted emotions and channel it to a vivacious flow? Passion? Love? A strong need to convey a message? Mattieu Kassovitz combined all those three plus a myriad of other motivation-driven tricks to embody the ambiance of a society torn by inner insecurity, grudge and hardly suppressed hatred. ""La Haine"" represents a 24 hours trip in the bowels of a modern decline fortified by volatile urge to express oneself, smothered in its formative stages by the uncompromising fist of a racist slogan: ""We don't need you, because you don't belong here..."" ",
220,6 March 2000,baida,10," Life in the ""banlieus""","I only saw this film recently and after watching I wondered what had taken me so long to get round to seeing it. The film was such a fantastic portrayal of the projects in France. La Haine has the all the ingredients for a classic, it is funny, tragic and extremely hard hitting. It combines police brutally with every day life, and highlights the hopelessness that young people in the ""banlieus"" feel. Talking about this film, I have heard mixed reactions, but if you can relate to what is going on then it is, to coin a well used phrase, ""a must see movie"". 10/10 in my books!",
221,11 March 2000,ral61,9," A tough, honest and human film thankfully not drenched in sentimentality.","At first sight, La Haine seems a film very much of its time. But it manages to break out of this accusation by focusing on the emotions of its characters. Set the day AFTER a Parisian riot (unlike most other films, which lead up to a riot as a kinetic, cinematic climax), the three main characters deal with the hospitalization of a friend by the police in startlingly different ways, despite their common background of prejudice and disillusion. It's the play between the three that makes the film, as over the space of 24 hours the viewer comes to understand their frustration - almost siding with them in the battle - before the denouement brings home the reality of the actions of both sides - the authorities and the protagonists. Filled with too many 'Oh no' moments for comfort, it's not a film that will make you feel warm and happy, but it still evokes a sense of hope that tough, honest and above all human films can be made these days without being drenched in sentimentality.",
222,17 April 2019,syedosamasami,10, In Love with French Cinema,This is a text book film for explaining the french cinema. Vincent Cassel is an extra ordinary performer.The film takes you through a roller coaster of highly relatable emotions at a very fast pace. I didn''t get bored even for a second,

227,12 October 2005,rdsmith-5,10, An Amazing Film,"I would love to procure a copy of this movie to view personally. I just finished viewing it in an African Studies Meeting and I simply adored the acting and film style. I can relate to the characters because I was ONCE a bit of each of them. I can also very much relate to Hubert and his struggles. Growing up, I have gone from the horrid conditions of Africa, to the ghettos of Arkansas,USA and New Orleans, USA to the horrid slums of Haiti, Republica Dominica and Burkina Faso. I found myself in numerous criminal enterprises because the so called ""good"" people were too busy to aid us poor, starving, low class ghetto youth. I have since cleaned my act up and thankfully never been caught and imprisoned. I have experienced many sides of the French and American colonial aftermaths and I know it is a sad place to find oneself in. The only way I see of beating this thing is by working very hard to overcome it.",
228,23 May 2002,lcpiquette,10," Real life, real emotion","This is one of the most powerful films I have seen to date.  The ending leaves you feeling raw and exposed.  This film isn't just about violence in France, or the problems of living in the projects.  It is about each and every one of us; about our world as a whole.  It reaches into your mind and heart and twists around everything you assumed about yourself, your life and your perspective.  Excellent film!  Not without it's humor, this movie is amazing!",
229,11 January 2004,melanie_ammer,9, Deeply impressed,"SPOILER After having watched the film at school, my pals and I were deeply impressed. Nobody had thought of that cruel ending of the film. Why did Hubert change his mind that fast? Who or what gave him the power to shoot at the cop? Was it his hate against the people who had destroyed his gym? Or was it the power of the gun he couldn´t resist? Nobody excepting Mathieu Kassovitz can say what´s the one and only answer to these questions. Indeed this thing should make us think about our way of living...",
