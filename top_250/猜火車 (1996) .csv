0,16 November 2019,Hitchcoc,9, Now I See Why,"I'm an old guy. I'm also a movie fan with an open mind. This is one of those films that is often referred to by critics as being very important. When I read the description of it, my first reactions was to totally avoid it. But it has in it some really great actors and I've been taken with the guy from Elementary. Well, was I surprised. While it was hard to watch as these young men dropped into the depths of addiction, I began to be fascinated by them. They were individuals who had aspirations and lives; they were good and bad. But were continually brought down by their mistakes. Those who say this glorifies drugs have totally missed the point.",/

The superb cinematography; the amazing cast of young actors (who have all gone on to become hugely successful in film and tv since); the iconic soundtrack: it all just fits together perfectly. 'Trainspotting' is as hilarious as it is deeply disturbing, but most importantly (and unlike many other films concerned with addiction) it's one hell of an entertaining flick and doesn't drag for a second.",e

8,25 March 2000,omophagia-2,10, One of the best films of the 1990s.,"In the aftermath of _Pulp Fiction_, much of the filmmaking of the 1990s thrived upon attempts to appear ""edgy"" within the constructs of independent films, or merely to provide empty shock value cliches. And no film ever came close to the sheer cleverness of Tarantino's masterpiece.",r
9,14 March 2021,briancham1994,9, Gritty portrayal of urban poverty,"This film is dark but also has a deep sense of realism. The subject matter of this film invites comparisons to Requiem for a Dream (2000). Relatively speaking, Trainspotting has more nuanced characters who seem to have more control over their lives and have more of an active choice in every situation, whereas Requiem for a Dream has characters driven by false hope and losing control over their lives entirely. The endings are still quite tragic in both cases though, as drug addiction ultimately has no winners. This film shows a wider view of the characters' lives and their hobbies, crimes, interactions and quirks, along with the environment around them. It's depressing as you'd expect, but has more of an ethnographic, ""chummy"" feeling compared to the hard-hitting rollercoaster ride that is Requiem for a Dream.",w

13,23 September 2012,classicsoncall,7," ""I'm cleaning up and I'm moving on.""","Where the glamorization of drugs comes in for some reviewers I just don't get. The early scene when Renton (Ewan McGregor) dives into the 'worst toilet in Scotland' makes drug users look like the vilest and lowest form of life on the planet, and his circle of friends a caricature of all the worst examples of humanity going. You look around and see the stark, disgusting flats they inhabit and there's no way anyone would want to emulate that kind of life. Unless you're a junkie I guess, and then it doesn't matter because the next hit is the only thing that does. I won't go to a lot of pains to review this film because for me it's a one off, something worth seeing as an insight into how low a person can get before figuring out that there's no solace in a needle, only a relentless slide to doom and destruction. Even Renton's ambiguous 'good deed' theft of the drug deal money at the finale left me convinced that in a sequel, he's going to be mainlining all over again.",8

Attention all ya Yanks and Brits who've grown up watching Disney movies an' think that the world is like that. ""Trainspotting"" shows that 'tisnt. This fantastic, if gross, flick tells the story of several pitiful Scottish heroin addicts, as seen through the eyes of Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor). Ya can't imagine what life is like fer these chaps.

21,19 November 2007,cpbadgeman,9, Flawless adaptation of a groundbreaking book,"It is doubtful that there is much new that can be said at this stage about this adaptation of Irvine Welsh's triumphant 1993 novel of the same name. The film follows the misadventures of a group of extremely dysfunctional characters who are immersed in an underworld of addiction, crime, and violence. Their darkly funny antics are shortsighted, aimless, and nearly always have a tragic outcome. In this universe, the humane become casualties and only the most unprincipled have any chance of escape. Nearly all of the main protagonists are addicts of one sort or another, with heroin being the drug of choice. However, this film does not glorify drug use. The addict lifestyle and worldview is portrayed as being just as pointless and empty of meaning as the materialistic values and aspirations that are promoted by mainstream society.",f
22,17 June 2017,hjpog,10, A mind blowing masterpiece.,"The film tells us that life is totally in our hands, the way we want it when we want it either to choose easy happiness or hard happiness, or not to choose anything at all. It could be one of the most impressive films about drug addiction. I also think it is the film that best describes the life style of the '90s, and the life of the teenager lost in this fast paced age. The best thing about the film is that, just like real life, the film can be interpreted by different people in many different formats. Nowadays, it is possible to find people who see this movie as a lifestyle. And because of youth criticism this film can be likened to Fight Club. Among the views about this movie are the comments of two groups of people who are really opposed to it. A group claims that the film is trying to spread drug use, while the other group claims that the film criticizes drug use. This certainly reveals the ability of the director and screenwriter. Because the film director is extremely neutral. Renton and his colleagues show drug addiction both in ways that ruin life and in life-changing aspects. Any comment from here is completely dependent on the locator. This neutral point of view on drugs in the film is the most important element that makes this film different from other films about drugs. Beyond everything is actually a journey story Trainspotting. Mark Renton's trainspotting, from Scotland to England, from a drug crisis, and a different kind of spiritual journey, without needing any curtains. The name Trainspotting is the name given to the act of recording the number of trains passing by on a train station, usually made by young children in England. Trainspotting characters, especially Renton, are always a move, a quest for the exact opposite of this still activity. While the whole world is still standing and watching the passers-by, Renton and his colleagues are on a journey with a head- up, a break from everything and everyone. Renton and his friends have resisted this moral, bourgeois lifestyle, all the norms set by society, and the tragic life that has been like Trainspotting, which has kept the human being motionless and killed the soul. It is a film that starts with irony and ends with irony. ""I do not want to choose life"" in response to Mark Renton's Lust for Life song, and at the end of the film, Mark tells a story with a full irony speech, It can be said that the two scenes that make the best use of irony in cinema history. To sum up, Trainspotting is the story of those who are not afraid to hit the bottom. Acceptance of life filled with short and disappointments. The story of those who chose to be hungry with the truths of life, filled with empty stories.",_

25,13 August 2013,zardoz-13,10, Tour De Force Anti-Heroin Opus,"You'll have to have a cast-iron stomach and few inhibitions to truly enjoy this tour-De-force anti-heroin melodrama. ""Shallow Grave"" director Danny Boyle and co-scenarist John Hodge distilled Irvine Welsh's atmosphere Scottish novel about the perils of addiction. This shameless consumers nightmare satire depicts the addiction that several people share, among them Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), and Spud (Ewen Bremner) as well as their non-junkie friends, particularly Francis Begbie (Robert Caryle) in Edinburgh, Scotland. Half-funny, half-tragic, ""Trainspotting"" isn't a movie that you will forget. Some of its memorable scenes verge on the surreal. Renton plunges into the worst toilet in Scotland to retrieve two opium suppositories. Later, when Renton is going cold turkey on heroin, he imagines that Begbie is under the sheets with him and that a dead baby is crawling across the ceiling. In another scene, Mark shoots heroine and imagines that he has sunk through the carpet; the heroin dealer Mother Superior hauls his body into the street and summons a cab to take him to the hospital. Throughout these scenes, Mark's perspective is looking up and out of a box with carpet on both sides. Interestingly enough, Renton's room at his parents' house is plastered with wallpaper of locomotives. Robert Caryle plays the one character who doesn't thrive on heroine. Instead of heroine, Begbie gets off on ""his own sensory addiction."" He likes to brandish his knife, boast loudly, and start fights. He amounts to the U.K. equivalent o Robert De Niro. Another Danny Boyle classic!",t
26,22 June 2000,MaderR,10, My new favorite movie,"Trainspotting is the best movie I've ever seen!  Danny Boyle did a excellent job of directing a movie based on Irvine Welsh's bestselling novel about desperate and hopeless Scottish heroin addicts.  And all the cast did a superb job acting some of the most outrageous and offensive characters I've ever seen.  The only downside of this movie is understanding those thick Scottish accents, but that also adds a bit of humor to the movie.",_

It shows both the horror and the humor of this day to day reality for these unfortunate souls. Screenwriter John Hodge (adapting the novel by Irvine Welsh) and director Danny Boyle give us a rich variety of moments throughout: some comical, some serious, some downright uncomfortable, and even some that are wonderfully surreal.

That's right, Trainspotting is a hilarious, dark, weird and sometimes painful masterpiece. Based on Irvine Welsh's cult novel (Welsh appears as a dealer, by the way), it's one of the most compelling, entertaining and shocking looks at the effect drugs can have on people, and it's to director Danny Boyle's eternal credit that he doesn't depict just one side of the story: we get to see what these people enjoy about getting high, so that we can, if not forgive them, at least understand them.",

Danny Boyle delivered here a great ""can happen everywhere everytime"" Story ... and newcomer Ewan Mcgregor (Obi Wan) perfectly plays Marc Renton here.

The novel of this film is completely a waste of time, but when it is put on the screen like this (especially by Danny Boyle) it gets good.  The actors are electrifyingly good, especially Ewan McGregor's breakthrough performance as a Scottish youth who's trying to get off heroin.

I really want to go to Scotland now after seeing this movie. I think all the acting was amazing and the characters were great. This movie has not one, but two jamming soundtracks. It is a definite in my DVD collection, as well as my CD collection. I haven't read the book, but I really want to. With a movie as well done as this the book must be amazing. It also makes me want to say no to drugs. Heroin looks like an all around bad idea. I highly highly recommend this film. It is amazing and most certainly worth watching.",
42,24 June 2007,eibeh007,9," Exceptional, powerful film","'Trainspotting' is a bleak, powerful and harrowing indie film, which propelled then unknown British actor, Ewan McGregor, onto the world stage. Its a controversial examination of the exploits, simultaneously humorous and poignant, of a coterie of Scottish drug addicts. Amazingly enough, this is only the second directorial effort from Danny Boyle after his acclaimed debut, ""Shallow Grave""(1994). Shot entirely on location in the capital of Scotland, Edinburgh, it revolves around six key characters--Mark, Francis, Sickboy, Spud, Tommy and Diane. The film is narrated by Ewan McGregor's central character, Mark ""rent-boy"" Renton, who decides to change his self-destructive lifestyle. His struggle to quell his heroin addiction subsequently effects his relationship with his family and drug-addled friends.

44,26 November 2017,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," Dark, disturbing, funny and life-affirming, this slightly sardonic shot-to-the-vein makes no judgement (on its characters or its audience) and pulls no punches.","'Trainspotting (1996)' is a slightly sardonic slice-of-life story sent as a super-speedy shot to the veins, a hyperactively eclectic look at four vigorously degenerate, disenchanted and desperately destitute individuals who each navigate through what they've come to call their lives and somehow like it. The characters occasionally glimpse their existence through a lens that allows them to see the filth in which they lay and the perceived perfection of the greener grass on which most others make their beds. Though the simple thing would be for the flick to focus upon the negativities of the protagonists' chosen lifestyle and to portray the quote unquote 'outside world' as the drug-free and consequently utopian society so many pictures of the kind seem to do so, it instead chooses to place the audience within the headspace of its characters, no matter how misguided that headspace may be, and allow them to decide whether they agree with the characters' actions, instead of spoon feeding them the easy answers so many may crave. It's in this ambiguity that the film finds both its nuances and its entertainment factor. Though it is, at times, an affectingly tough and even teeth-clenching experience that never shies away from true darkness (and even some disturbingly surrealist horror), it is also an enjoyable and funny flick that finds humour even in the darkest of situations. A general sense of aimlessness does sour the piece ever so slightly, but it doesn't dampen its overall effect. 7/10.",

47,1 February 2004,paul2001sw-1,8, Boyle's best,"Irvine Welsh's cult novel 'Trainspotting' is the grim, irreverent and defiant story of Edinburgh's drug-addled counter-culture, told in a fierce Edinburgh patois.  The achievement of Danny Boyle's film is its reinterpretation of what is a decidedly literary accomplishment in a cinematic form while nonetheless staying true to the spirit of the book. Ewan McGregor is excellent is a lead role that grants no glamour to its star, while Robert Carlyle is hilarious as his psychopathic 'friend'. Indeed, the easy way in which the film combines humour and the lowest depths of the junkie life is very impressive, although (perhaps inevitably) the overall tone is slightly less grim (and somewhat more crowd-pleasing) than that of the original.  Incidentally, while the true nature of its enigmatic title, 'Trainspotting', lurks in an excised chapter of the novel, those of a mountain-spotting persuasion will recognise an appearance by Leum Uillam in a minor role.",
48,3 April 2009,kenjha,3, Revolting,"This rambling film looks at Scottish teens doing drugs. There isn't much of a plot. The teens sit around shooting heroin and talking about mostly uninteresting things in thick accents laden with Scottish slang. There are some repulsive scenes, such McGregor sticking his hands into the filthiest toilet in Scotland right having done his business and before flushing it. We are also treated to blood-splattering violence and scenes of needles penetrating the skin. While Boyle displays an interesting visual style, it is not clear what the point of this film is. It's either glorifying drugs or saying that drugs are bad. Either way, it does not qualify as entertainment.",
49,15 November 2009,Jacques98,7," Like the main character, I just don't care.","If a middle-aged man were to walk outside his house right now in a chicken suit and started attacking small children, a lot of people would say he lacks maturity. Or, perhaps, that he's a pervert. If he sustained his attack long enough, he'd be on the news, and the police would come, handcuff him, and laugh in the guy's face. Lack of maturity is something that is obviously negative in out society. What I find interesting, though, is: what is labeled as immaturity in real life is labeled as sublime quirkiness on the movie screen. Sometimes. Other times, in case of shows like The Wiggles, immaturity is labeled as stupid. Other times, in case of comedies, immaturity is labeled as hilarious. Other times, in case of books like Naked Lunch, immaturity is labeled as offensive. Other times, in case of movies like Trainspotting, immaturity is just generic, boring, and I've seen this so many times I know exactly what's going to happen in five minutes, oh look! I was right.",

Ewan McGregor gets his breakout role as the weak-willed heroin-addicted poster boy Mark Renton, who constantly surrounds himself with a gaggle of the worst friends money can buy. It's a thousand different emotions all rolled into one concise package, with a dozen scenes that had me laughing out loud, an equal number of gut punches, a few manic spurts of action, a load of excellent off-the-cuff conversations and one giant, trainwrecked final score. A nonstop, chaotic adventure with a well-rounded cast of characters and a knack for extreme moods, it's occasionally tough to discern the dialog thanks to the abundance of thick Scottish accents.

Ewan McGregor was excellent as the troubled and weak Renton, giving us both a tragic hero, yet one with vices that tend to control him. Overall, I felt the story was very strong, and the other actors (Ewan Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Robert Carlyle, Kevin McKidd and Kelly MacDonald) brought in a rather quirky and dysfunctional backdrop to Renton's troubles.

In the early years of film, most movies about drugs were usually cautionary tales (as was the case for Reefer Madness (1936)).

74,27 December 2019,ofpsmith,8, Not quite what I expected.,"I ought to start by saying that I liked the film. I had known about this film for a while, thinking it was something akin to other 1990s crime comedies like Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels or The Big Lebowski. In retrospect I suppose that was a bit naive. Trainspotting is often described as a comedy but while it has comedic elements to it the film felt much more like a drama/surreal fever dream. While such imagery would usually remind me of David Lynch the aforementioned comedic elements and the presence of illicit drugs reminded me more of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Francis Bacon in particular was cited as an influence and it makes sense. Dealing with the harsh realities of drug addiction the film certainly wasn't pleasant and kind of hard to watch in parts. But these aren't appealing themes. Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) our protagonist narrates to us his difficulties with social pressure (to get off drugs), shots of the Edinburgh drug scene into which he is immersed, the degradation of his life on drugs, his unreliable friends, and the perceived mediocrity and boredom of life without drugs. As a result, while I can't relate to many of Renton's issues I can still empathize, even though he makes plenty of bad decisions that continue to drive him into a hole. Marking down an opinion then is difficult. While more gritty (and even depressing) than I expected it to be Trainspotting is still enjoyable and you can't say it's not a good movie.",

The hallucinations and fears in Renton 's detoxification reminded me of the little confusion in Wit Prison Life, no matter how much he loves Zhiyuan, he ca n't escape the end of relapse into prison. Renton, who has successfully detoxified, lived the life of ordinary people, and the arrival of Begbie and SickBoy broke this kind of calm. The indulgence and sinking of adolescence seemed to enter the life of Renton again. The £ 16,000 transaction dramatically prompted Renton to choose the path that most people recognized. Parents always want to teach their children their experiences, so that they can avoid detours, but the road is their own.

The film portrays the lives of a group of friends, most of whom are heroin addicts and the story of their seemingly relentless march towards simultaneous self destruction and discovery. Having lived in Scotland all my life the film does what few mainstream box-office smashes dare to, which is to give an accurate and truthful (if not slightly comical) portrayal of life for drug addicts and the lower classes in Scotland. This is made all the more poignant by the fact the story is set in Edinburgh, a city renound for its beauty and wealth, but which has a seedy underbelly of poverty, violence and drug abuse in the city's peripheral housing schemes (ignored by the wealthy inhabitants of the city centre).

There really is no story per se and I don't think that this movie could ever match up to the likes of Snatch and Requiem for a dream. Quite simply its a movie about a bunch of people who do drugs and then hallucinate through half the movie. The rest of the movie is about the main protagonist (Renton) if you could call him that going from one hallucination to another until his parents shut him up in a room to help him get over the habit. Thereafter he steals from his 'friends' and elopes with a lot of money. Between that and the beginning nothing much happens. There are a bunch of other characters I did not feel much for.. Of note is Robert Carlyle's portrayal of Begbie. In the scenes that he appears he steals the limelight and those are about the only scenes that to me were tolerable. So there's not much of a story, a sh!tload of 'bollocks' and somehow this movie is in the IMDb top 250. I suppose you will tell me that it has a cult following.. who are these 'cults', tell them to stay away from sites like IMDb. No sir, trainspotting does not deserve 8.2 stars, money wasted, time wasted.

The film chronicles a multitude of different events that happen in Renton's life in a kind of free form method, all involving sex and drugs.

Basically in Edinburgh, Scotland, we are introduced to heroin addict Mark ""Rent Boy"" Renton (Scotland BAFTA winner Ewan McGregor) and his fellow addict friends, con artist Simon ""Sick Boy"" Williamson; slow-witted, kind-hearted Daniel ""Spud"" Murphy (Ewen Bremner); clean-cut athlete Thomas ""Tommy"" MacKenzie (Kevin McKidd) and psychopath Francis ""Franco"" Begbie (Scotland BAFTA nominated Robert Carlyle). Renton decides to quit heroin and eases the transition with opium rectal suppositories bought from dealer Mikey Forrester (Irvine Welsh), he has a final hit, and a spell of violent diarrhoea, before locking himself in a cheap hotel room to endure the withdrawal period. Renton goes with his friends to a club, his sex drive has returned, he leaves with young girl Diane (Scotland BAFTA nominated Kelly Macdonald) and they have sex, in the morning he is shocked to find out she is a 15-year- old schoolgirl, she blackmails him to stay in touch. Renton, Sick Boy and Spud start taking heroin again, Tommy begins using it as well, as his girlfriend Lizzy (Pauline Lynch) has dumped him, one day their drug taking is interrupted by friend and fellow addict Allison (Susan Vidler) discovering her infant daughter Dawn has died from neglect, all are horrified, especially Sick Boy who may secretly be the child's father. Renton and Spud are arrested after stealing from a bookshop, Spud goes to prison, while Renton is released for entering a Drug Interventions Programme, he is given methadone, but is desperate for a more substantial high, Renton almost dies of an overdose and is taken by taxi to hospital. Following this Renton's parents, Mr. Renton (James Cosmo) and Mrs. Renton (Eileen Nicholas), take him home and lock in his old bedroom to force him through withdrawal, Renton goes through the symptoms, and sees nightmarish images, including Diane singing, his friends giving him advice, the dead baby crawling on the ceiling, and his parents on a gameshow hosted by Dale Winton, with questions about HIV. Renton finally woken from his nightmares and hallucinations, his parents tell him to get tested, he tests negative, despite the years of sharing syringes with other addicts, Renton is in low spirits and depressed, he visits Tommy, who is now addicted and HIV- positive. Renton takes a job as a property letting agent, he is enjoying his life of sobriety and saving his money, while still seeing Diane, however he is annoyed when Begbie and Sick Boy move into his bedsit unannounced, Begbie has committed armed robbery, and Sick Boy is now a pimp and drug dealer. Tommy dies from toxoplasmosis, the three attend his funeral, Spud has been released from prison, Sick Boy suggests a lucrative but dangerous heroin transaction, but Renton needs to supply some of the money, and he tests the heroin for its purity. They sell the heroin to a London dealer for £16,000, they celebrate in a pub, Renton suggests to Spud stealing the money, but Spud is too scared of what Begbie will do, but Renton is finally fed up with Begbie, having seen his reaction to an accidental beer spill, he glasses and beats a man near to death. Early in the morning, as the others sleep, Renton takes the money bag from sleeping Bedbie's arms, Spud is awake and they look at each other as he watches him leave, but Spud remains silent. In the end, when the others awaken, Begbie is in a violent rage and destroys the hotel room, Sick Boy and Spud flee as the police arrive, Renton vows to stay stable, and Spud £4,000 in a locker. Also starring Peter Mullan as Swanney ""Mother Superior"", Shirley Henderson as Gail and Keith Allen as Dealer. McGregor is brilliant as the smart-aleck junkie, Carlyle is stunning as the violent, easily enraged psycho, and the other supporting stars give great performances too, Boyle's direction is stylish and intelligent, it really brings the book to life, the subjects of drug-taking and petty-crime are covered in both hilarious and hard-hitting ways, the film is not afraid to be controversial and at times bleak, but there are the lighter scenes which keep it fun, it is a true original British classic, a must see black comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, and it won the Scotland BAFTA for Best Feature Film, and it was nominated for Best Writer.

I give just about every movie a chance and I stayed with this one 'til the end, but if your tastes are anything like mine and you're not a glutton for punishment I strongly suggest that you avoid this one or turn it off after the toilet scene.",

This is one of the best British films made, as well as one of the best about drug use. It is not for everyone; if you can't watch a movie that depicts addiction if it doesn't only show the negatives(and, let's be honest, most of those ridiculously exaggerate them) of it without screaming ""this glorifies the use of *insert name of narcotic here*!"", you are not in the target audience. Guess what? That approach doesn't work, it doesn't deter, lying in order to scare kids away from things you don't want them messing with costs you credibility and does not, in fact, always prevent them from pursuing whatever you were trying to get them to steer clear of. I would also like to point out that this is rather unapologetically disgusting, and you'll want to not eat for a while before or after your viewing. And if you're still interested in this after those two pieces of information, then I would suggest you give this a chance. It's engaging from start to finish; frankly, I could not take my eyes off it. Even if you've never seen a junkie, you can get into this. It gives you an unforgettable peek at the environment. The characters are well-developed, credible and fully fleshed out. While you may not like them, you can't keep from having a reaction to them; you can't tell yourself ""there's no one like that in the real world"". There is marvelous social commentary and satire in this. This is hilarious, the humor is immensely sharp and well-delivered, almost no joke or gag falls flat, and it does not try too hard. The music is magnificent. Boyle directs this in a stylish(*not* to be confused with ""flashy"") and experimental manner, and every moment of it is treated to excellent camera-work and editing, leading to numerous unique sequences. There is a lot of strong language, a little sex, brief nudity, quite a bit of disturbing content and some violence in this. The DVD comes with a couple of interviews, well worth the time. I recommend this to everyone mature enough to handle it. 10/10",

118,17 August 2020,ethanjackh,10, A true classic,Trainspotting one of the few films I would sight as masterpieces in their art. I love everything about this film and feel that it has a brilliant energy that's not seen in most films. Director Danny Boyel has truly outdone himself with this brilliant work exploring drug use. I also view it as one of the best adaptations of all time as Boyle uses the source material and then outperforms it using the techniques of filmmaking. Also this being one of his earliest films truly shows how as a director he is a master of his craft and is truly underrated. I do believe that this films is criminally underrated by the general public and critics alike most likely downtown its subject matter but the true genius of the film is in not how it glorifies drugs which it certainly does not but it instead takes the view of the protagonist showing what the characters endure and the realisation of their situation. The cast is phenomenal with performances all round being superb especially from a young Ewan McGregor showing his talent at an early age. Overall I would say that this is one film that I will always love and view as a true great work of cinema. I might also add that if you enjoyed this film you should definitely take a look at the sequel as it is a brilliant return to the characters and i myself view it as one of the best sequels of all time. So please watch this film if you love cinema.,

After all, we're not ******* stupid. At least, we're not that ******* stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring."" What is it like to have one worry so strong that it consumes every waking hour? ""Because no matter how much you stash or how much you steal, you'll never have enough. No matter how often you go out and rob and **** people over, you always need to get up and do it all over again."" These quotes by Renton give some perspective. Too live this way is tragic.

That something as simple as heroin could, allegedly, replace any conventional pursuit of dopamine and higher purpose; the job, the car, the family, the greater good.
Heroin is just simplifying human pursuits and endeavors down to the single point of a needle, the needle we have been looking for in the haystack, the basic chemical that compels human activity and purpose; drug addict Mark Renton asks why we should complicate that pursuit.",

I'll admit that I wasn't blown away when I first watched it, but I imagine that's because it became a victim of its own hype. Boyle's sophomore directing effort has got a major cult following and I've heard plenty of praise from some of my more film- obsessed friends. I didn't actually see it until a month or so ago and, while I enjoyed it, I wasn't sure why it was such a big deal. So I gave it some time to sink in, then went back and rewatched it again recently and fared a little better. Maybe it was the thick Scottish accents making dialogue difficult to follow at times or the retro nineties vibe, but it didn't sit well originally and a second viewing let me get past all that and enjoy it. TRAINSPOTTING follows some Edinburgh hood-rats living the junkie life and going where it takes them. There's Renton (Ewan McGregor), persistently on the verge of going clean and giving up his hedonist lifestyle; Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), a schemer and troublemaker with an encyclopedic knowledge of 007; Spud (Ewen Bremner), dopey and loyal to his mates; Tommy (Kevin McKidd), the smart one who seems capable of maintaining a (mostly) mature relationship and knows enough to keep away from the heroin habit his friends have sunken into; and Begbie (Robert Carlyle), a drunken psychopath who abhors his friends' love for heroin but doesn't mind putting a glass mug through some poor random pub patron's face.",

I also feel that parts of this film glorified drug use and the whole druggie environment – as in take drugs, life becomes simple and you don't have to care about anyone anymore – all problems are solved. The film has them giddily robbing people of their possessions – but a lot of addicts also sell their bodies (maybe several times a day) to get their drug money. This issue is not breached at all in film. It's a lot more cinematic and playful to show junkies stealing and running than to show them soliciting strangers to have anonymous sex.",

It skewers mainstream values while showing that the rejection of these values in favor of a junkie's lifestyle is ultimately a dead end, and just as vapid as mainstream life can be. The film develops it's characters extremely fast and with precision. We are drawn to them and feel an affinity with them for a variety of reasons, even though they are all in one way or another, degenerates. But we pull for them to beat their habits, to get out of their miserable conditions. But we never pity them, because despite their predicament, they manage to live it up and live life, and feel emotion and express their desires. There is also plenty of humor to go around, much of it dark. The editing, soundtrack, acting and story suck you in to an ""experience"". The film has heart and soul and set a new standard in it's way. It is such an original work of art, with many memorable scenes.

Film-critics have criticized Trainspotting for glamorizing drugs - I don't agree.

This split decision revolves around two things; firstly the gross content. Any film that makes you feel uneasy or quite sick at what's going on on screen could automatically plant a negative opinion within your mind but this idea battles with the effectiveness of the film in the sense; if a film is so nasty in its content and unravelling of events that it evokes a definite reaction from the viewer, it could be deemed a success because the filmmakers have succeeded in what they set out to do.",

Trainspotting, which is based on Irvine Welsh's cult novel and is directed by Shallow Grave helmsman Danny Boyle, became a smash hit in the UK during its run there. Miramax, hoping for a similar reaction on this side of the Atlantic, has been shouting from the rooftops, using big, splashy print ads and chaotic TV and theatrical spots to lure in their target audience.

153,21 October 2008,metalrules31,10," Choose Life, Choose Trainspotting","Whenever we meet someone new, or want to have a conversation with someone we don't know that much, we constantly rely on hobbies. People ask questions like ""What do you do on your free time?"" or ""What is your favorite song?"". But the toughest question to ask somebody is what their favorite movie is. A non-regular movie-goer might not have a bad time answering. A girl might go for The Notebook or Titanic, while a male might chose Lord of the Rings, Star Wars or any action flick. I personally have trouble deciding among Clockwork Orange or Pulp Fiction, but my favorite movie of all time must be Trainspotting. Trainspotting is a Scottish movie, based on a book by the same name and starting Ewan McGregor as Renton. Although he is the movie's main focus, we meet other characters who enrich the cinematic experience. Sickboy, Spud, Swanney, Tommy, Diane, and Begby. Most of these guys with a little problem, they're heroin addicts. Some try to quit and others join in the process. The movie clearly portrays all the risks and disadvantages of being involved in this world and the negative things it eventually leads to, but, at the same time, the characters never deny the satisfaction that this vice gives to them. ""Take the best orgasm you've ever had... multiply it by a thousand, and you're still nowhere near it"", Renton narrates at some point in the movie. The real reason why this is my favorite movie is simply because your average friend can watch it and know for certain that he has seen an excellent movie. He will not be confused by Pulp Fiction, or distressed by A Clockwork Orange. Certainly it is a movie you should see if you still haven't. It gets you glued to your sit until the fabulous ending. The soundtrack is also a highlight, featuring songs from artists such as Blur, Brian Eno, Pulp, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed and of course Underworld, with its memorable song, Born Slippy, all placed in perfect timing with the movie's screening.

The 'anti-drugs' message is relatively clear: I suppose this is the embedded message within the film, asking the audience: ""Would you like to end up like these people?""

165,17 June 2019,pedropsouza,10, More than a drug film.,"Trainspotting is a 1996 drama British film, directed by Danny Boyle and based on the book of the writer Irvine Welsh. The film tells the story of a group of young heroin addicts in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the begining of the movie, the speech of a character says: ""choose life, choose a job, choose a career, a family..."" with this initial speech in the film we can also understand the idea of the search for control and something standardized about life. The essence of the narrative emphasizes an existencial emptiness that motivates individuals to perpetrate in a world where misery and social conventions can not supposedly achieve: drugs. However, as we perceive (as listeners to dialogue with the respective character), this refuge is expensive. We are taken to the gutter of ostracism, where the fissure reigns for one more dose at the expense of morality. The custom of choosing a career, family, care, etc, in the speech of this character, refers to us to the concept of a safe and stabilized life, where everything is in its place. Form this idea, we realize that the film tries to bring another reality of life, sends a message about the different about a group of young boys who want to get out of the anguish of ""normality"" and find something different.",
166,10 August 2016,frenchjuice,8, Choose Life,"Comedic and stylish, Trainspotting manages to tell stories of heroin addicts in a highly energetic way. Trainspotting, directed by Danny Boyle, uses different cinematic techniques, music, and comedic timing every five minutes, if it were any other film the movie would have been completely incoherent, but the varying use of techniques does not hinder the movie's pacing but instead establishes the tone of the chaotic life of a heroin addict. ",
167,26 August 1999,V Hanna,8, Ride unlike many others!!,"Trainspotting is truly a wild ride down a path that thankfully many of us don't see. We all know how the overuse and dependency of drugs can destroy a life, the gripping struggle many endure to pull themselves out of that toilet, and the ruin they can bring to others around them. But Trainspotting is a movie that shows more than just the dark travails of this ugly trip as the movie 'Basketball Diaries' does to excruciating detail. It reaffirms why life, as is wonderfully described in a Dylan like way by Ewan McGregor in the beginning of the movie, is worth living. What separates this movie and elevates it from other movies that cover this same tone and subject material is that the main character is not totally destroyed and left in a dark hopeless state at the end just to emphasize the why you shouldn't do drugs lesson. The movie ends with great hope and answers McGregor's own opening question of why choose life. And I will say emphatically again it is one hell of a ride. We follow McGregor and his excellently casted mates through all the stages of drug abuse and the Alice in Wonderland like adventures that follow it. Robert Carlye played the volatile Francis Begbie to an Oscar like perfection. His outburst struck me like a dark comedy where you almost hate to laugh but your true honesty leaves you no choice. Definitely one of the most memorable characters from a movie in the 90's.  From drug dens to night clubs the cast mixes so well. The humor bounces wildly off the wall like something you get out of a gum ball machine. You never know when it will jump out in front of you so be ready. Danny Boyle deserves a great nod and a raise of the glass for a directing job well done. He chooses shots from great angles and adds all kinds of perfectly captured perks as well. One of my favorite scenes is the shot from the floor as McGregor has just taken a large hit of heroin. He proceeds to sink into a large red rug right through the floor. Every proceeding shot is from this unusual point of view until he is brought out of his dazed state at a local hospital. For someone who has never done heroin (and doesn't particularly plan to) this is one of the feelings I can imagine the drug delivering me to as I watch McGregor dip into the floor. That folks is a sign of a good director. When you have a camera in your hands and you want to have the audience truly feel what something is like why just tell them? Too easy and makes for a dull movie. Which is an incurable disease eighty percent of filmmakers have today. Show them dammit!! Use your imagination and create uniqueness. Make your movie stand out. The soundtrack compliments Trainspotting to a tee and adds to the movie's slick electric settings and rich cinematography. The only slight problem with the movie is that at times some of the Scottish accents get as thick as something out of a broken espresso machine. You will find yourself trying to understand what the hell is being said but just pay attention to what is going on within the scene and you will make it through with flying colors. This movie was not what I expected. It thrilled me in many different ways and added new life to subject material that I am sure hasn't seen the last foot tracks come its way.",

There is that scene when they attempt to bugger off together and do something different in the fresh air country side. How quickly they lose their motivation, I would have kept walking towards those mountains man, no matter what. Im from Malta and the drug scene here is due to the lack of such opportunities to do something else if you ask me. This film is pretty heavy for straight characters because you really got to understand these individuals before calling them social parasites, you got to see the world from their eyes.....and thats what trainspotting is offering.

All the performances were wonderful, especially (as is often commented on, and rightly so) Mr. McGregor's fantastic work.

The motif here is that the film begins with Mark Renton (literally) running away from responsibility, and that is practically what he is doing for the rest of the film. His (and his friends') way of doing this is by using heroin. At first, the film shows us the good parts of using the drug and describes why one would use it (""Take the best orgasm you've ever had and multiply it by a thousand, and you're still nowhere near it), but the film progressively gets darker to show us the consequences of the drug, but without ever losing its energy and dark sense of humor.

What makes this movie different is its fashionable way of unfolding itself which really deviates from conventional film-making.

It is a constant drug high where one must eventually face consequences. Renton dives into the filthiest toilet in Scotland to retrieve pills he bad stashed up his ass. He is saved from an overdose and attempts to go clean but his friends encourage him to test drugs. Spud is timid and takes drugs before a job interview. Sick Boy makes comments regarding Ursula Andress as the sexiest Bond girl. Tommy pays a big price for his addiction and Begbie is psychotic. Gross humour with stylish directing by Danny Boyle. Ewan McGregor as Renton struggles morally even on his good intentions when theft becomes a factor for freedom. Robert Carlyle as Begbie is ill tempered and the object of the ultimate betrayal and his own eventual downfall. Ewen Bremmer as Spud avoids work and is involved in a gross scene regarding soiled bed sheets. Kelly Macdonald plays a female whom Renton encounters and has sex with until he learns that she is under age. She blackmails him and even invades his withdrawal nightmares. Jonny Lee Miller plays Sick Boy whose life choices leads to destructive and fatal consequences. It knows the highs and lows and the narrow path dead ahead. Score: 8 / 10",

A kid born to a junkie mother just down the block is born deaf and without eyes. The kid of another junkie mother who lives directly behind you is born without a brain. Because the child won't live through the night, the young mother is allowed to bring it home. The child dies in her arms. A brother-in-law, strung out on heroin, almost causes his wife to have a miscarriage because he can't function well enough to get her to the hospital when her water breaks. Her baby is born with brain damage as a result. I could go on, but it's late and I'm not really up to this. TRAINSPOTTING is superb film-making, with credible performances, great music, and some of the most surreal sequences ever shot. And, as that old philosopher Alice Cooper once pointed out: Dead Babies can take care of themselves.",

The costumes are great each character sort of has a style that embodies their personality. Ewan McGregor looks great in his tight skinny jeans with his shaved head. I love the character of spud he is so funny. Everything he does in this movie makes me laugh, and his accent is intense. I can't understand him, but I like him. I got kind of mad when they shot the dog in the ass because I'm an animal lover, but the dialogue they had during that scene was great. The music in this film was great, so great in fact that there are two jamming sound tracks! I have theme on cassette tape because I am just that cool and old school.

We get an interesting character, that's what. One surrounded by references to other nonconformist or antiheroic characters of visual past... the Beatles' Abbey Road cover, a bar set to look (somewhat obviously) like the milk bar from Clockwork Orange, the amusingly cheeky art of Andy Warhol... all to provide a background for a guy who takes drugs, quits, steals, and each time does it with different results and to different levels and with no really strict 3/5 act story design.",

No matter where you personally come down on the issue of drug abuse; it gives you plenty to ponder.  An interesting thing about this film to me is that you can enjoy from the standpoint of just watching it for fun, or you can watch it from the standpoint of someone watching it to grapple with philosophical issues.  True, the protagonists in this flick are a motley crew, but even in the depths of despair and degradation hope comes through.  Albeit often in morose ways.  Sick Boy's agony over the babies death for example shows even the most craven usurious junkie has a basic element of human decency.  The heroin scam, while an angst filled undertaking, is an act of hope on their part that can be likened to the hope of degenerate gamblers trying for that big win.  The musical score is a superb fit for the movie, too.  It is a drug movie and quite arguably the best one ever made at that.",
219,23 September 2000,molotov85,10," Morally disgusting (yeah, right, whatever!)","I know what you're thinking  disgusting, heroin chic movie; I also know you're wrong. Trainspotting can be disgusting (dead zombie babies, the worst toilet in Scotland, Begbie going psycho on some innocents, but that's it)) but if you're sensitive why are you watching a film about a bunch of junkies?  If you're American the shots that show the needle being inserted are cut out (or so IMDB claims)!!! Heroin chic? Now that is wrong! Everything that these bunch of junkie loser scum touch turns to dust. There is almost nothing cool about Renton, Spud or Sick Boy. Some of the characters dialogue (Take your best orgasm multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near [the highs of heroin]' for example) could be construed as to be glorifying heroin but they aren't; they're explaining why they take heroin. Anyway just watching them or seeing what heroin turns previously nice-guy Tommy into is enough to turn you off heroin. Forever. For a film to be able to do that it has to be powerful and that is exactly what Trainspotting is. The acting is of such a high calibre that someone deserved an Oscar. No, Trainspotting deserves ALL the Oscars, the soundtrack, the screenplay, the supporting actors, the supporting actresses, everything is perfect. What deserves especial praise is the fact that it is funny. Black humour is rampant throughout the film; the philosophical dog/park/airgun scene is typically Trainspotting  disgusting and hilarious. Trainspotting will never get mentioned in the same breath as Casablanca, Citizen Kane and Sound Of Music, even though it should, because of its subject matter and that makes me sad. So what are you waiting for? Go and watch it!!! Oh you don't like needles do you? Never mind then",

With a very varied filmography, ranging from the zombie apocalypse to biopics, as is the case of the recent Steve Jobs, the director always seeks to keep the focus on the psychology of his characters and, in the process, ends up highlighting the talent of countless actors still rising. Trainspotting - Without Limits is no exception, and plunges us into the world of drugs in such a disconcerting way as Requiem for a Dream, which would be released four years later. The production became a cult and, later, a young classic, being celebrated for its dynamic language, for the authentic and stylized way in which it portrayed junkie culture and, of course, for helping to introduce the world to actors like Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlyle.",

Despite this, taking Trainspotting for what it is, Danny Boyle's second venture into the world of film seems rather uplifting and invigorating despite the somewhat macabre storyline. Clearly making references and paying tribute to many independent pioneers of pop cultural ladened films, it surprised me to discover that Trainspotting is in fact based on the novel of the same name. Despite such a fresh and promising film, Trainspotting when examined under close scrutiny seems rather unextraordinary. Although performances from most of the cast are rather nice, with special praise going to Ewan McGreggor and Robert Carlyle, the storyline still seems to be rather void of any life; it instead has to rely upon it's pop cultural references and controversial themes to keep both the plot and its audience plodding along nicely. Trainspotting is ultimately a fantastic homage to all things, admittedly not the best selection, British. It's because of this, and with some rather nice camera work, that the audience deems it acceptable to look over any minor errors that stop this film from becoming a brilliant piece of British cinema.",

After several viewings of both movies, I came to the conclusion that Requiem touches upon audiences emotions and sentiments while Trainspotting touches upon their reason. Trainspotting offers a realistic depiction of drug use, making audiences enjoy the movie and not cry at then end as Requiem quite often does. An extremely intelligent script and famous ""trippy"" scenes (notably the famous, or even infamous to some, toilet scene) all add up to this movie's uniqueness in its genre. As the protagonist Renton puts it after all there is a concrete reason for their habits which are frowned upon by society. The realistic depiction of drugs like heroin are not enough to make a movie great. It is the subtle social implications raised which bring out the idea behind Trainspotting. Here, I am referring to the first lines of the movie, and when Renton evokes his mother's ""socially accepted"" drug addictions among many others. Also, the flow of the movie is really enjoyable, as the ending leaves its impact on the audience. Nonetheless, it isn't a positive depiction of drugs. The dark colors, the apartment's constantly decaying state, the dead baby, and Renton's friend's death reveal the utter realism of drugs.",

I saw this movie recently and in my opinion it's a masterpiece, a lot of people don't give the deserved credit to this movie simply because they've missed the point of the movie, this is not a drug appealing movie, this is a anti-drug movie.

The movie is highly graphic and quite shocking I have to say, but this somehow corresponds with the gravity of the experience itself that Boyle has brilliantly and vividly conveyed to the audience in fluttering stages: the absence, the denial, the realization, the struggle, the relapse... etc. The film doesn't lecture or blame; it doesn't treat drug use as an individual case but as a societal phenomena that has everything to do with the atmosphere back then.

The latter is somewhat baffling but I'm sure some of it must come from Ewan McGregor's enthusiastic opening and closing mantra which bookends the film. The funny thing is the abruptness of the tone of this short monologue and how it has shifted over an hour and a half. The film's soundtrack is like background club music, constantly pulsing and pumping as these Scottish addicts go about their aimless lives. That's how Renton sees this safe, domestic path of life - aimless, boring. Then at the end he has the same words, and I'm sure that he feels the same way too.

246,12 March 2001,jhclues,8, Tough Film To Watch,"The effect of heroin addiction on a young man and his closest friends is explored in the hard-hitting drama, `Trainspotting,' directed by Danny Boyle.  Set in Scotland, Ewan McGregor stars as Renton, a young man to whom drugs have become a way of life; in fact, more than a `way of' life, they have `become' his life.  And a more filthy, degrading lifestyle one would be hard put to imagine.  Renton has arrived at a point wherein absolutely nothing means anything to him:  Family, friends, job, nothing.  All that matters is the next fix.  And to get it, he will do whatever it takes, including robbing, stealing or even betraying his mates.  It's a hard life, but to `Rents' the high-- even with the total loss of self esteem-- makes it all worth it; and he'll get it any way he can:  Snorting, shooting up or using suppositories.  Eventually, however, Renton's bad life gets even worse, and as he emerges on morning from has drug-induced haze, he realizes things are going to have to change.  The question is, can he do it?  Or will he even want to. 	The film is a hard look at the depths to which an addict will descend and what one will do to get that fix.  To illustrate the point, there is one graphic scene (almost too hard to watch), in which Renton, losing a couple of suppositories (they had yet to melt) through a sudden act of nature, proceeds upon realizing it to turn around and fish for them in the `filthiest toilet in Scotland.'  The scene is almost unbearable, but what an example of what it means to be in thrall to drugs.  In another scene, not quite as graphic but powerful nonetheless, Renton's parents lock him in his room and he is forced to go `cold turkey.'  And although, after the aforementioned scene this is a bit easier to watch, it is still unpleasant, but delivers a succinct message about the nature of drug addiction.	 	McGregor is well cast as Renton, as he brings a clean-cut look to the part that seems so contradictory to the lifestyle embraced by the character.  The perfect choice of all the characters through which to tell the story, Renton has a look and an attitude that convey a life that holds such promise; here is a lad with a future.  And therein lies a message in itself:  When drugs are involved, never judge a book by it's cover, for addiction is never discerning.  Most importantly, McGregor's performance is believable and he has a charismatic screen presence that makes Renton someone with whom the audience will readily be able to identify, which is necessary for the film to work.  Without that connection, much of the message of this film would be lost, but thanks to McGregor, as well as some bold moments courtesy of director Boyle, it is not. 	The supporting cast includes Ewen Bremmer (Spud), Jonny Lee Miller (Sick Boy), Kevin McKidd (Tommy), Robert Carlyle (Begbie), Kelly Macdonald (Diane) and Peter Mullan (Swanney).  One of the best anti-drug films in memory, `Trainspotting' will affect even the most jaded abuser of controlled substances, for it puts the situation into perspective and gives it context, while keeping it at (still an uncomfortable) arm's length.  It may be tough to watch, but there are lessons to be learned from it that are invaluable. A great companion feature to the more recent `Traffic,' this is a film that will no doubt have a dramatic affect on those who see it, for the images it presents will not easily be forgotten. And if this film will save even one person from learning about drugs the hard way, then it will have made the endeavor entirely worthwhile.  Be advised, this film is more educational than entertaining, and definitely an experience.  I rate this one 8/10.",

The mixture of the hard reality of ""intravenous injecting of hard drugs"" and surreal alice in wonderland scenes such as renton climbing down a toilet. The scene where his mum and dad lock mark renton in his room is sheer genious.  Everybody's felt fevered like it, but to have it discribed so acurately is unnerving to say the least.

Its sad that this movie didn't get the attention that it needed but it's not too late to change that. I recommend this movie to you 100% !!!!!!!,

For him it is hard, since he cannot stay three feet away from it and his friends have a big impact on it, which he cannot stay away from either. This is the third Danny Boyle film I have seen and the last I've seen of his for a long time. Trainspotting is funny on most counts such as the bb gun shot to the dog who attacks its owner and the toilet scene. The characters in the movie were good and this movie shot up McGregor's career a bunch, which lead to The Phantom Menace for him. I knew this film was about drugs, but most drug scenes were quite disturbing and let off a complete distraction which reminded me of Requiem of a Dream in some ways. Most of these scenes pretty much explain why you should not take drugs. Anyways, the soundtrack was good and the cinematography was perfect as well.

The technique applied, and very well applied here by the beginning director Danny Boyle, we have a fast and fleeting assembly, alienated with a series of cuts and different plans that pass, euphoria, sadness, depression, joy and solitude, the director knows how to use in the Different scenes, as for example in the trips of Reanton, where we have several quick cuts to pass its euphoria, and open plans to pass its solitude and closes to pass the climate of its degradation, all this in a scene. Consequently we have a great mix of sound and a soundtrack that mixes from this pop to classical music, and this mix is ​​great and talks to every feeling of the montage. All the performances here, no exceptions are wonderful, all the actors seem to have been born for the role and could not be different, it would be ridiculous to quote everyone, but they all perform completely wonderful performances.

The story follows a young Mark Renton as he tries to find his place in a world that is ever changing. It is a story ultimately about friendship- with childhood mates (all of whom are classically different), girlfriends, and... of course... drugs. It is a story that almost all can relate to in some way because we have all found ourselves at one point teetering between the two realms of growing up and moving on with that of the comforts of old habits, places and people. It is a brilliant look at the trials of lost souls- how they live in and function in the world- and what it was like to be young and Scottish during a period of dramatic change. From the charming Sick Boy to the shy Mark Renton, the world of Trainspotting provides a character for everybody. Even though Mark is, in a way, an anti-hero, he is charming and captivating enough that can't help but root for him and ultimately fall in love as you watch him and the story unfold on screen. Ewan Mc Gregor as Mark Renton perhaps gives one of his best performances of his career... and the rest of the cast is stunning as well.

We used to just sit in his living room, going ""ohhh. So now what?"". Practically, every time the answer was: ""let's watch it again"". The first time you see this film, you are left with little but a big time fun (which is, by the way, not at all a bad thing). But this film grows enormously with every successive time you watch it. Every character gains substance, and you begin to comprehend the depth of each one of the situations portrayed. This movie achieves to entertain, with a near-perfect pace, gorgeous performances and unbelievably wit lines, and still manages to tell an actually very important story, to reflect the view of the world that most of the people of our age share deep inside: the anger towards the modern empty ideals and the futility in resisting them.

His performance alone is worth watching but the movie has its merits too. If you don't understand addicts or their world, this is the movie to see. It paints a realistic and very gloomy portrayal of their lives and worlds. It's not pro-drug or anti-drug. It just tells a story about drugs and their addicts (Trust me, the drugs own the addict and not the other way around).

By turns cheeky, surreal, exhilarating and stomach-churning, it follows assorted days in the lives of mangy Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor who is absolutely brilliant as the smart-aleck junkie) - a degenerate boil on society's backside - and the scabby crew of junkies, deadbeats, thieves, liars and nut jobs he calls friends. These characters are not duped by evil drug pushers, but consciously choose drugs over the banality of well, pretty much everything else. But these personalities, like the settings — bile green apartment walls and the blood red den of their dealer - are stylized and get a sudden and shocking reality injection straight after a catalog of hilariously catastrophic encounters. Renton tries to get his life back on the rails, but the nightmares of his past follow him even to London where he snatches despair from the very jaws of hope. Fittingly, he and his unwelcome flat-mates return briefly to their Edinburgh roots to bury another heroin statistic, before a coach trip back south for an amateurish, pathetic drug deal - selling rather than buying, for once, and for one last thrill. It all goes pear-shaped, naturally, and no one is surprised, because by now the message is sinking in: heroin is for losers!",

McGregor is good and so is debutante Kelly McDonald as his schoolgirl girlfriend but Carlyle is the star if the show with a truly psychotic and chilling performance.",
309,4 August 2018,apjc,9," Very good film, pulls no punches.","At times funny, always intriguing rather than entertaining. This is a sad story of those wretched people caught up in the horrors and squalor of depending on drugs more than anything in life. It may be shocking to some, but it never glamorises this sorry state, there are no heroes they're all low life. The main character remains a thief and recusant druggie until the end.",
310,17 January 2010,arthera09,9, classic from Danny Boyle,"I am not sure if I want to give this a 8, or 9 because honestly it is hard to tell what they are saying more than once. So there is fantastic dialog, but if I cannot understand what they are saying it is not good. This goes hand in hand with the narration. I love Ewan McGregor in this, but since I had to focus trying to figure out what he was saying that I missed what was happening on screen sometimes. The reason that I give this a 9 though is because I love this movie. I really love how the direction reflects the tone of the film and what is happening on the screen. The introduction of the characters at the beginning with the narration gives so much information that is an overload honestly, but I think that is the point. I love how during his kicking of the habit after his overdose how there was no continuity between shots and it was as frenetic as possible. The music was awesome and I really loved some of the soundtrack choices. All of the acting was top notch and to pick out any of the cast as a stand out is hard because they all played it out perfectly. I think the most successful part of the film is that Boyle never makes you want to do heroine, but definitely is able to demonstrate why these people are hooked. As soon as you might think that you want to try some he just hits you in the right way so you DO NOT want to ever try it. I love how Renton at the end just says that I am a bad person and that there was no real hero here and the fact that we were rooting for those terrible human beings says a lot about the film. One of my favorite scenes is when Spudd is messing up with job interview and with Renton right before that trying to explain how to mess it up, but not too badly. Then Boyle takes two different cameras which from the shot differently and just cut between the two without disturbing the flow of the dialog at all. It really was a great scene and very simple trick that added to the feel of the scene and actually added a bit to the character. Great movie and it is great to see Boyle come into his own and create his own voice.",

Danny Boyle gives the film the same boundless energy the characters live with, and the actors give appropriately energetic performances. Ewan McGregor stands out especially, as he gives his character ore depth the any of the others. The film's style evokes Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, though Boyle is not as flashy as either of the aforementioned two, and this film puts more emphasis on the actual story than the style or dialogue. The depiction of drug use in the film is graphic, though it is not distracting or overly gratuitous. I would rank this film among the ranks of Requiem of a Dream and Traffic, as it delivers a strong anti-drug message while maintaining a compelling plot and well-rounded characters.",

I'm not implying that one movie copied the other, nor am I implying any negative connotations. Just simply noticing the similarities. It had very interesting depictions and point of views of what one with a drug addiction might encounter. The story, at times, can be very emotional. There were also times where what was going on was creepy or strange, with intentions of making the viewer catch a glimpse of the protagonist's world. A job well done on that as well. The directing, writing, and acting were all exceptional. This movie is an emotional ride-along with the protagonist, which was, to say the least, insightful. Going back to the aforementioned movie, Requiem for a Dream; if you liked that, it's almost guaranteed you're going to like Trainspotting.",
325,12 August 2000,Funky A,9, Another exceptional Danny Boyle movie!,"Danny Boyle has made some of the best movies of the 90's with great movies like Shallow Grave, A Life Less Ordinary and this one. Trainspotting is a movie about drugs and drug-users. This is a difficult subject, mostly because it's hard to talk about it without moralizing, but this movie achieves it with class. First of all, Ewan McGregor is excellent as Rent-Boy. But the rest of the cast also shines. Robert Carlyle is great as the deranged Begbie, Jonny Lee Miller, an actor which I had never heard of before, is excellent as Sick-Boy and Ewan Bremner(another actor I had never heard of before) is perfect for the role of Spuds. And let's not forget Kevin McKidd(yet another actor I had never heard from) which gives a very sensible performance as Tommy. The dialogue is always believable(although I lost a little bit of it when I first head Begbie's accent). The movie has found the perfect balance between harsh realism and fantasy, but also the perfect balance between drama and comedy. Because, even if this movie could have been a potential downer, it is not one. It takes it subject seriously, but at the same time, who could find a movie where a man plunges into a toilet and finds himself swimming in it can be absolutely depressing? Boyle's directing is a pure pleasure, creative and dynamic, but it never goes into MTV territories, which many less talented directors would have been to with this subject and such an... amazing soundtrack. Yes, even the soundtrack is excellent(which is not really a surprise, since this is a Danny Boyle movie) and includes music by Underworld, Iggy Pop, Blur and many others. One of the few problems this movie has is that I find that it doesn't talk enough about Renton's relationship with Diane. Apart from that it's a twisted, well-acted, intelligent, sensible and at the same time energizing movie. I highly recommend it(along with Shallow Grave and A Life Less Ordinary).",
326,2 February 1999,great_sphinx_42,9, How did I love this movie? Let me count the ways..........,"WOW!!!!! The last movie I saw that came anywhere near captivating me as much as this one did was ""A Clockwork Orange."" This movie is absolutely wondrous: beautiful, stylish, heartbreaking, thought-provoking, hilarious, obscene, terrifying, arousing, and extremely quotable. It also has a fantastic soundtrack. This was the star-maker for Ewan McGregor, and very deservingly so. He's nothing short of splendid. It is a rare actor who can do with this role what he did. He is truly unforgettable. All of the other characters were wonderfully developed, with all concerned doing a marvelous job. The editing, direction, sets, etc. were all fabulous. Begbie's creeping menace was scarier than hell! Sick Boy was poignant, funny, and devious all at the same time. Diane was likable because she's a teenage girl who knows what she wants- a rarity in movies. I've never been so close to puking while still laughing as I was during the Spud-in-his-girlfriend's-kitchen scene. My roommate cried her eyes out at baby Dawn's unhappy fate. That's about it: we laughed, we cried, we hurled. A movie quite beyond compare, and one that I suggest to anyone wanting to see what a true tour-de-force looks like.",

It follows the trail of Rent-Boy, Spud, Sick-Boy, Begbie, and Tommy, five Scottish friends into heroin and illegal dealings.  The film is funny, sad, depressing, and even a tad hopeful at the end.  The truth is that this movie makes the already rather tainted world of drugs look even more unappealing and dismal. Despite its necessary gloominess, the movie is smart and moves well, although it does seem a bit long.  This movie is not for immature or younger viewers simply because it's rather disturbing in parts and they probably wouldn't understand it.

I especially loved the opening scene, the ""Worst Toilet in Scotland"" scene, the bar scene where no one goes home alone, and the scene in which Renton goes home to his parents. I could only find this video on the internet for sale but I loved it so much. I was eventually able to find it for sale at some small convenient store. they had it marked up to about 150% of what it should have been but I bought it any way. I probably watch it once a month.

Impressionable young people will be influenced by the character of Renton who is portrayed as cool, amusing, and attractive to women, but is also a drug addict. Addicts are also portrayed as hard, take-what-they-want, and outside normal society, appealing characteristics to disaffected teenagers.

The movie is what it is, a story of low life junkies that shows you every aspect of a low life junkie in grave detail. The acting wasn't poor, but the basic premise is something you can learn from a crap 30 minute health class movie, as in, there's not much of a story line to connect with or care about.

In Trainspotting the Scottish accent surely helped to add amusement as well as the amusing little characters that liter the movie. Here is the basic lot. POSIBLE SPOILERS Well there is Renton who is a hopeless heroin addict who gets stuck in the worst toilet in Scotland, that would, by the way, be the main guy. There is Sick Boy who everyone calls Sick Boy because he is, well, sick. There is Begbie who everyone is afraid off because he is the sort of person who will bite your head off for brushing up against him in a crowded pub. There is also Diane who's choice wardrobe for success is moderately skimpy little dress and a school girl outfit. There is also Spud who's brains one finds themselves pondering over and Tommy who is all good and proper but ends up dyeing (must not be hard enough for the tough existence). So there's the gang, and this gang goes on an adventure of sorts all though which Renton can not make up his mind whether to `choose life' or `choose heroin'. When he chooses, keep in mind, it is not necessarily final. A wonderful movie based on a book by Irvine Welsh which, if the first few pages are an example, is very hard to understand.",

353,29 May 1999,Mr Pants,10, What have you got to live for?,"I find it highly amusing that many people have described this film as an ""anti-drug"" movie. If you wanna know why they're not forcing kids to watch this film, it's because its stance on drug use is fairly neutral, not the usual ""zero tolerance"" espoused by the ""war"" on drugs. I thought the point was that in heroin, Renton and his pals find a meaning for their lives. My Brit friends tell me that the term ""trainspotting"" is shorthand for ""losers,"" and that is of course what these guys are. But as Renton explains throughout the film, aside from the pleasure of smack, it offers direction and purpose. When you're on skag, your life becomes very structured: fix, and then figure out how to get another fix. It's no different than people who go to law school or get business degrees: it provides them a means to structure their life. This is something that we all do; heroin in the mix just makes us sit up and notice. No one would want to see this if it concerned Mark Renton and his on-again, off-again relationship with the shady allure of investment banking.",

Of course it was! Two hour of film cannot possibly hold the content of hundreds of pages of text. I know, you know, we all know. However, if there is one movie that I cannot stress the old trite adage on enough it is ""Trainspotting."" My friends, my brother, my cousins, people I didn't even know kept telling me over and over that I NEEDED to see ""Trainspotting."" My life was incomplete without watching the movie. Even after I told them that I've already read the book, they still told me to forget the book and that the movie was probably better. So, I buckled. I saw it...and quite frankly I'm glad that I read it first because the movie was kinda weak. The movie bare-boned the plot, left out some of the best scenes in the book (Rents did more than just dive into a toilet in a bathroom), left a couple of pretty interesting characters out completely, and SICK BOY SHOT THE DOG!! The directing and the acting were both very good, but the script seemed to be fueled solely on heroin. The whole movie revolved around heroin, and the book didn't. Heroin was very important to the story, obviously, but that wasn't it. The book actually dealt with the ideas presented by Rents in the all-too-famous opening lines. I felt the movie worked under the assumption that drug-culture IS anti-culture. It's not. The movie irked me in the way that hippies irk me, you're not sticking it to the man by doing drugs.

On the other hand, it shows us what life is like on the other side of England, which is that they give them housing, work, and when they don't have work, the government itself got the government. I think it's super good how the government handles the stability of the people. On the movie side, it seems like a great movie to me. I also really like the way they present the personality of each character and their charisma, and the art where the baby died leaves us a great lesson on how we should care for children when in a situation like this.",

This is a very grim story lightened at times with comic dialogue and situations, but the viewer carries away only a feeling of horror. Drug addiction and what it does to the lives of all it touches, including infants, is the overriding theme. At the same time one also feels the horror of day-to-day life for these young men with little faith in themselves and despair at the dead end of their young lives. Ewan McGregor is particularly fine as Renton, the man who seems to be succeeding at making a life for himself without drugs, but this is up to question at the end of the film.

The characters are fun and painfully real, they have their needs,. wants and dislikes and a life philosophy. Even tho we follow the main character, we aren't always rooting for him, he ruins life for everyone around him, and even when he tries to be better he does it still. the story and characters besides, if i were to watch this movie on mute i'd still enjoy my time, because the camerawork and scenes are a pleasure to look at, the film has fun with its visuals where it can, making many very memorable scenes have that extra touch to make them even more memorable. Its packed with scenes that matter, leaving almost no filler, its both fun and depressing at times, but always seems to know when to be which.

I think the guy who plays sick boy is cute to. Something about misfit junkies does it for me. I think Trainspotting is a fabulous film. I like the story, I like how it is shot, and the acting is great. There are definitely a couple of nasty moments, but you can always fast forward. I like when Ewan's character is setting up to go through detox and he has a bag full of random food and tools he thinks he will need to get him of drugs. The girl who Ewan goes home with is such a bad ass and her dress was really cool. Though I'm not so sure about the twist with her being underage played out. I found it a bit creepy.

It is an interesting looks into the world of what I assume to be lower class Scottish society. It seems as though in real life it might be a pretty miserable existence, but the characters in this film make it seem sort of enthralling. The acting is really great and each charter adds their own particular layer to the dynamic of the group. With a kicking soundtrack and killer wardrobe this is a film that I quickly made a member of my DVD collection. There are a lot of really cool shots in this film. Even though the toilet scene is really gross. I love how it is shot, and when he is climbing out of the toilet, genus shot.

Overall this movie was pretty good, but my expectations were higher. Little tip: don't watch this movie with your family, or better, if you want to (or have to) watch it with them, just pay attention to how this movie shows the negative side of drugs, which in my opinion isn't something every movie shows.

The visual imagery, use of color, and surrealness of the protagonist's hallucinations are superbly done and a joy to watch.  The fecal humor, on the other hand, is not.  Human excrement is about the only thing in the world that really sickens me, and there are two or three scenes in this film that never made me want to take a crap again. I think the film could've evoked that yummy fecal imagery in just as effective a way if it were left to the viewer's visual imagination instead of being thrown in our face (literally), but that's just me...

The film is built up to explain the effects of the drug, people living in disgraceful flats, not caring about anything else but ""hero"".

Based on the 1993 Irvine Welsh novel of the same name, this film shows us the world according to Mark Renton, the anti-hero of anti-hero's. Funny, poignant, disturbing, and completely un-sugarcoated, Trainspotting shows us life as it truly is: often depressing, frightening, dangerous, and sadly way too short. Definitely the polar opposite of those 90's ""teen"" films that show life as all beautiful people who, in the end, go on to great things and are always successful. There is no beauty here. Just life at its most raw and ugly state. In other words, IT IS REAL. If you haven't seen this film and have a strong stomach, I highly recommend it. If you haven't read the book... what the hell's wrong with you??? As great as Trainspotting the film is, the book is far better, and paints a clearer picture of the sordid characters who make it all happen. 10/10 stars I have loved this film since i first saw it 7 years ago and continue to read everything Irvine Welsh publishes.

Trainspotting shows us this duality by introducing us to the crime, drug and sex- induced life of Mark Renton. Mark is a heroin addict who wants to quit but keeps getting dragged back into the life he wants to leave behind. On the surface we the viewer are thinking he could just quit and get on with it, but what seems to be an easy choice on the surface usually is more layered and harder to make as Mark shows us in this great film.",

This you will enjoy. Now for a critical analysis of the movie. Initially, Danny Boyle did a fantastic job here, some beautiful shots and a energetic vicious pace. The characters were very believable with notable credit to be given to General Franco Begbie.

I've seen the film a few times sober, and its still an excellent film. I'm glad I wasn't just in a drug-haze and thought the film was good. If you've ever been an addict, you'll love this film. If you've never been an addict, well you might like it anyways if you enjoy a good film. Trust me, this film doesn't promote drug use at all. If anything it shows you what its like to be a drug addict. It is a movie, so there's always gonna be some stuff that is obviously strictly movie stuff. However the dirty grimy, straight up nature of this film and the way it portrays drug culture is pretty accurate. Hell I even love the ""big drug deal"" at the end, I always had friends (myself included) trying to get that big ""score"" that was gonna make you rich. People always think they are the shite too, but I love how Renton sums it up when he says the buyer knew they were just some dumb fools who got lucky.

This is the first film i've seen from Danny Boyle and his directing was basically perfect. He directed in such a way that you felt a part of Mark Reton's life. The script was incredible to, Ewan Mcgregor's opening speech blew me away. Very explicit sex and drug use which made you feel more involved and made the movie more intense. This movie really had a great way of showing what drug addiction is really like and how it can really mess up your life. The soundtrack is also great, Iggy Pop's lust for life is one of my favorite original songs and fitted really well with the opening scene. Another thing that really made this film stand out is the slightly sure real moments that it brings which makes it so original, the humor is fantastic. Over all i was on the edge of my seat with this movie and i loved every minute of it",

Fairly early on, Renton attempts to escape the vices which hold him by going 'cold turkey'...but fails on numerous occasions.

The camera work in this movie is excellent but the true winning part of the movie comes at the end. The end scene is one of the most suspenseful scenes I have ever seen in my life.

I was stunned by the graphic use of heroin, the superb acting, and the horrible conditions in which the addicts lived.  Throughout all the death, horrid conditions, and drama, the movie's main point appears; Choose Life.  Our anti-hero, Renton (played by McGregor in his best performance), goes through the life-changing experience of becoming just like his parents. In which lies the satire of the film, the escapists look for a way out, but end up working 9 to 5, choosing life, and wanting a big, bleeping television.",

Absolutely hilarious, riveting, terrifying and occationally devistating.  In the same vein as Sid and Nancy, if you enjoy that type of really dark and funny film, you'll love this one.  Basically its about a bunch of young heroin addicts and the antics they get into.  Don't remember the plot in detail, but it eventually thickens as the 3 main characters (highly developed and fascinating characters I might add) try to complete a large heroin deal to make a ton of cash.  This of course leads to a ton of trouble as they can't exactly trust each other.  This movie is indeed a porthole into a world which is fascinating, yet no one would ever actually want to visit.

It is my official favourite film. I love the way you can have a laugh at some of the things that are said and yet the whole thing just moves you. When i was reading the reviews i have to admit i was bitterly disappointed. Everyone has done justice to EWAN MCGREGOR and ROBERT CARLYLE but very few people have mentioned JONNY LEE MILLER. To me he was fantastic. HE had a charm about him which none of the others had. Also when he was crying over the crib i was crying too. I just can't believe he isn't as ""big"" as EWAN MCGREGOR. Seriously though i thought the film was brilliant. It has been directed and cast so well. The soundtrack is fantastic. Everything is so brilliant. I watch the film every night. NO matter what time it is i have to watch the film. It has changed my views on life. I used to be constantly and annoyingly happy but no i realize that not everyone gets to be happy all the time.

I loved the way that it was filmed, some very creative use of angles.  The scene were Renton is coming off of Heroin and is locked in his room is enough to scare anyone straight.

462,25 January 2020,thelostone_2011,10, A great movie and a cult classic,This movie has been accused of glorifying heroin usage but that so untrue. This movie just like Requiem of dream. Shows the ugly side of addiction. Yes its black comedy same as its novel but not once does it show heroin usage in a positive way. Renton is a addicted and he struggles day after day to over come it. He eventually does spoil alert this movie is over 20 years old so no apologies by stealing money from his friends and becoming a clean addicted free person in the outcome. I absolutely love this movie cause it tackles a difficult subject and and leads us through the perils of a addicted who overcomes. A dark move yes but a great story regardless,

Rarely does a film actually change me but this did, with a perspective not only on drugs but on life in general I had not considered before. All the characters have both likable but with flaws as with anyone you'd meet in real-life, and to look upon such a controversial subject with such conviction, imagination and a comic touch deserves real credit.",

The sound track is amazing featuring some choice iggy-pop tracks and you really can't beat the punk style wardrobe. The guys look good in there tight jeans and tight t-shirts. Sick boy strays away with his formal ware, but he still looks killer. Not only does this move have great tunes and slamming outfits it actually has a decent plot and great acting. The story is about misfit junkies creating ruckus around Edinburgh and doing anything they can to pay for they drugs and then having small bursts of trying to get clean. All the characters work well to create a smorgasbord of crazy enjoyable characters. This movie really takes boys will be boys to the extreme.

I mean pooping in a significant others bed, that is probably the most embarrassing thing I can think of. I love the club scene it is so 90's and I like how alienated Ewan feels because; I think that's how clubs are. They are such weird places and you really never know where you stand because it's dark and you are most likely a little drunk or at least everyone else is so no one is really a great judge of character. I think they do a really good job of portraying that awkward club feeling. I like the friendships between the guys. They seem very realistic. The whole movie has a very real feel to it.

Ironically, like Quentin Tarantino, director Danny Boyle has since embarrassed himself with soft-minded disasters, e.g. ""The Beach"", with its even softer-headed heart-throb, DiCaprio. Maybe there was a hint of this already in the soundtrack with its heavy dose of early smack bards like Iggy Pop and Lou Reed. But the wit and grit, the great writing, the heroin-induced hallucination sequences, the sheer filth of it all, and oh, the performances. ""Trainspotting"" made the careers of Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlyle, not to mention Kelly Macdonald who has since graced us with her ""Gosford Park"" presence.

In this movie they used these evergreen's in the way the were meant to be (in my opinion). It also shows that a good movie is made by a great plot and great actors instead of a lot of money.

I liked this movie a lot even though some of the parts made me cringe a lot. Especially the blue baby, I jumped when I first say that part; it was awful. I think it is kind of sad how they turn the one friend who is not on drugs into a junky by taking his sex tape, but then again who makes a sex tape in the first place?! The detox sequence is crazy; it made me never ever want to do drugs. I think this movie is definitely worth watching, but is certainly not for the faint at heart. P.S. I really love all the accents. Sean Connery isn't the only one with a sexy Scottish accent! I'm a sucker for anyone with an accent. Scottish ones are cute, they sort of sound like they are from space.

Whilst the Scottish accent might cause some trouble to those of you who have not lived there for atleast a couple of years, the story was fairly clear to my Australian mates.  I didn't need to do much translation.  I recommend that you go out right now and buy the DVD or video.  It is a must have movie in your collection.  The acting and the plot are very well done.

All the actors did such a great job of creating believable characters. I liked all their outfits too! They have some wacky fashion in Scotland. I thought it was funny how much they drank. They even were drinking when they went hiking. These people are never sober even when they aren't doing drugs. Their apartments were tiny; I don't think I could ever live in such a hole. I couldn't understand some parts of the movie because the accents are so thick; also the Scottish breakfast was nasty. Who eats baked beans for in the morning nasty!

A lot of times I hate voice over, but it works really well in this film. The acting is great. The guy who played spud most likely deserves an Oscar for the scene where he does a job interview on speed. I couldn't understand a word he was saying but it cracked me up. Having the tourniquet and needle in the heel of the shoe was pretty cool looking. Though I frown upon elicit drug use. I love when they bring a bag of beers to go hiking. It seems so funny the drinking culture in the UK. In almost every scene at least someone is drinking a beer. The parents are concerned about their children's drug habits, yet they all seem to be alcoholics. I love the club scene. Why they put Ewan McGregor in a mid-drift t-shirt I don't know, but I loved it. This movie takes having for all intensive purpose crappy life and makes it seem OK. The characters are fascinating and you just like them so much you want to know what they are up to even though it's most likely screwing their lives up even more. I love this movie and I highly recommend everyone watch it.",
482,9 April 2007,kennedyi222,9, great film,"I've never thought about doing heroin before, but it is weird how this movie almost makes it seem like it is OK. I guess it is because the story of the characters is so endearing you don't really think about it is about a pack of virtually useless junkies. I think the acting is great. The toilet scene with Ewan McGregor is classic. It is probably one of the most disgusting things I have ever scene on screen. The scene where the two guys are talking about their girlfriends and the two girls are talking about their boyfriends at the same time is really well done. There are a lot of little nuances that make this film great. The baby is the worst part. Every time I watch that part I hate it, I always want to fast-forward through it. The music in the film is great. A soundtrack I can definitely rock out to. I think Scottish accents sound really crazy. I can't even begin to imitate it. When spud has his job interview I can't understand a word he is saying. I notice something new every time I watch this movie, it's always enjoyable and it always makes me say no to drugs!",

You take drugs, or you don't; you take marijuana or you don't...nothing matters... if you understand the language of cinema, you are gonna love this, worship this film. Right from the start it takes off. It takes off the flight you would have never imagined. The music, the visuals of the Renton, Spud running...(Here comes Jonny again/with liquor and drugs)... what a beginning of a film...!!! It takes your senses away to deepest, surrealist, absurd, chaotic, whimsical, wild, roller coaster ride which you only grasp f you are a true art lover... Talking of arts, Trainspotting is a genius, in all the terms. Right from the grotesque visuals to the dialogue to the acting to the editing to the sound to the everything t's a gem! Why they name of 'Slumdog Millionaire'!... undoubtedly Trainspotting is the so far best of Danny Boyle. Even you look at the title of this great creation, this gives you merely a hint that what you are going to watch is only a time-pass!!! But, surely, it took a passionate hard work and great imaginative brain to create such a gem!!! Words cannot recreate the movie, so better watch!!!",

Either way, I've never tried heroin so are the ""trips"" realistic I don't know but I'm certain I don't wanna dive in any toilet so I'm certain never to try. As far as Americans not embracing flix from abroad that is such a generalization it's ridiculous and that most people don't get the point is impossible. Choose life choose life choose life. Even we Hoosiers can figure it out when it's said several times in the movie and written on the box.

490,9 April 2011,brandon_5303,10," Not Just a ""Drug Movie""","I don't much care for drug movies. The majority of them are far too extreme toward one side or the other: glorifying or demonizing drugs. Take for example ""Scarface"" (drugs will give you the strength to take on an entire army of would-be assassins before a coward finally gets you from behind) or ""Requiem For a Dream"" (drugs will make you lose your arm, go to prison, wind up in a mental hospital, and/or perform carnal acts to satisfy your heroin addiction). That being said, I consider ""Trainspotting"" to be the first of these so-called ""drug movie"" to find moderation. Yes, Renton and friends do find themselves in drug filled euphoria in some scenes, but for every good time, there is also bad. The characters go through changes and are hardly recognizable by the end. All in all Danny Boyle did a magnificent job directing this film, John Hodge did the same adapting it, and Ewan McGregor and co. did amazingly portraying it. 10/10",

The film follows a group of friends that are heroin addicts, and love to break the law in various ways. It's a very dark comedy, and has an excellent performance from Ewan McGregor as the main character, Mark. My favorite part of the movie was the characters, by far. They are just so interesting, especially Mark. His philosophy, though very disagreeable, is very intriguing. I absolutely love the ending. I suppose the worst part of it for me is the story. It's good, but it wouldn't work without the excellent performances. Also, the Scottish accent is a little distracting, but that is more of a nitpick. In the end, this is a great movie, and deserves a lot more attention.",

I love this movie so much, because it offers a real, no-nonsense, b.s.-free look at the people who do drugs, their 'friends', and their lifestyle. It offers a reason _why_ people wreck their lives with heroin, and that's something I have never seen before. Excellent character study. Ewan McGregor is a natural in the lead role (it is this role that caught George Lucas' attention), and Robert Carlyle is perfectly cast as Begbie. The rest of the cast falls in line and it works very well. Watch for the description of a high at the beginning of the movie - it is very well done. To sum it up: combine 'Forrest Gump' with 'The Basketball Diaries' and this is what you'd get. Read the book.",

Requiem for a Dream was much sadder. Seeing this movie once is fine but repeated viewings of it are not recommended. I do not think that the characters are very deep and I only feel slightly sad for one of them. The only thing I learned from this movie is that Heroin use causes you to have disgusting poo.

Set in Edinburgh in Scotland, the movie hits close to home as I was born nearby in a city called Glasgow, so any and all landmarks mentioned in this film I have a personal attachment to. Given the sensitive nature of the main conflict in the film, and the fact that the aforementioned issue was a real life, and rather large issue in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and throughout Scotland during the 1980's and 1990's, it sends a really strong message about what abuse can do to a person and their relationships.

It is superbly rendered and so realistic (even the hallucinating scenes of the high junkies) that it feels as if I am there. Only watch if you have a strong stomach, though... and you may not want to eat. The acting is stupendous but that accents are so thick, it is hard to understand every word and the characters talk about 100 miles a minute. It'll probably take a couple of viewings to catch every word but I assure you that it is worth the many times you see it. Be prepared for morbid humor and lots of blood. Despite the fact that it is about drugs and addicts, I think it has a sort of feel good ending, in a strange way. Ewan McGregor carries off Renton like he WAS the man. I urge any and all people to watch this movie. It is so worth it and you are missing a great moment in cinema.",

You really do feel for the characters and can sympaphise with their not exactly ordinary, drug-fuelled lives.  In short, a great film mixed with dark humour, sick jokes (who will ever forget the excrement in the bed sheets scene...) and excellent story-telling.

The heroin addicts in this film are scumbags, liars, cheats and violent to boot but they are played so charmingly by Mcgregor and co that we grow to love them, all of them besides Robert Carlyle's menacing Begbie. This is a film that is completely anti-drugs but instead of preaching the message that they are wrong we see that they are wrong through the experiences of the gang and we almost understand why they are addicted to this life ruining drug. A dead baby, a good guy turned bad in tommy and a skag deal later you look back and think ""this is one hell of a film.""

Its emphasis on the highs and especially the lows of the drug is excellent. Some of the scenes, such as the baby crawling across the ceiling, are amazing. Trainspotting also managed to launch quite a few careers. Would Ewan Mcgregor be starring alongside one of the biggest actresses in the world in Moulin Rougee without Trainspotting? I think not. What about Robert Carlyle and Johnny Lee Miller? How many of us had heard of them before Trainspotting? The film itself is about a young Scottish heroin addict, who hangs around with a group of fellow addicts. As the film progresses, Renton (Ewan Mcregor) becomes more and more dependent on the drug. After a bad experience of cold turkey, he moves down to London. Unfortunaetly he cant escape his past, and in particular one character Begby, who is, in my view, the scariest person in cinema history.",

538,27 September 1999,jradko,10, goooood....,This movie just kicks ass.. my absolute favorite... I love it for many reasons.  i used to live in europe so it is really close to the reality i know from the past. and this is so true of a story. just awesome....,
539,10 October 1999,sarahmay,10, yes!,"This movie is so great, one of my favorites. Its based on the book by Irvine Welsh, which is even better, because he is such a good writer. It doesn't make heroin use all glamorous but it doesn't just have some kind of just say no attitude either. Its really funny and I would recommend it to anyone.",
540,8 December 2000,philip_the_greek,10, What to do with the reasons when you got heroine?,"A masterpiece, an ingenious comment on the 90's western lifestyle. Marc Renton is a hero of our times. He himself is a reacting junkie, unwilling to adopt to the modern way of living, of choosing life,and getting things straight,  for no reason. More or less, what to do with the reasons when you got heroine?",
541,30 August 2003,The Lodge,10," Buy Now, Pay Later","Set in Edinburgh in the last decades of the 20th century, the film is equally as relevant to any contemporary location. It most obviously comments on 'drug' culture, but also on the hypocrisy of more widely accepted substance use and the quick-fix-have-now-pay-later society that so willingly buys into the same ethos. Painful scenes portray the widespread superficial understanding of the depth of the issues surrounding substance abuse and the devastation, despair and lack of control felt by the abusers and by those around.",
542,24 August 2000,cupes,10, a very alternative and positive film,"trainspotting can be considered ,probably, one of the best film of the 1996,for the originality of the plots and the good recitacion of the actors.The geniality of the film is the ability of speaking about an argument ,the drug without the false common moralism.In conclusion a very good film.",

One is even in a TV commercial (the cruise ship with the rock climbing wall). Trainspotting is unforgettable and even haunting. And, so is the soundtrack.",

547,30 December 2001,ounzueta,10, Welcome to another real world,"Years go by, and Trainspotting is still my favorite movie, and as a matter of fact, I believe people that speak against this film, is just because they didn't understand it as a whole.",
548,22 February 2007,wolfboehm,10, Heroin is only a sub plot,"this movie is awesome, the best drug movie ever, even though its not even about drugs, its about screwed up lives. The drugs are only a sub plot, most people don't see that. Renton and Begbie and Spud and Sick boy are all tragic characters (except maybe Begbie). It is also one of the scariest movies i have ever seen, how anybody can say its pro drugs is just insane! this movie is terrifying! There are two or three scenes that just blow my mind and scare me to death. I wont tell anybody these so they shock you as much as they did me. This and Requim for a Dream are the two greatest movies involving heroin addiction and dealing. Fear and Loathing is good, but its a humorous one and it isn't really about heroin addicts",
549,26 May 2022,adrianpereira-75527,8, It's a great movie...,"The way in which the film conveys an air of singular decadence is undoubtedly one of the most faithful aspects imbued in almost every character in the plot. The violence, drugs, carnal desire, and materialism between good, evil, and doubt are extremely striking until the end.",

551,27 January 2003,miste26,10, dark,"I thought that this was going to be boring but I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is outstanding. Bravo to Ewan who really makes you feel that he is going through withdrawal. Ewan is a man of many talents. It's amazing to see that he can act in so many different genres. He really is a versatile actor. I only wish that he could have sung in this movie! This movie kept me there. With some movies you watch them but you could talk or do something else while you are watching but not this one. I was glued to the tv. It's riveting, brilliant, stupendous, captivating and over all makes you fall for ""Mark"". Maybe that's just me because I feel that Ewan is one of the most brilliant actors, so brilliant that I would put him up there with the greats like Clark Gable, Jack Nicholson, Robert Redford, Gene Hackman etc etc etc. I could go on forever about how wonderful he is. One can only expect bigger and better things from him and that he is going to around for a long time.",
552,27 April 2023,estivensanch,10, La addiction,"Renton is an individual who suffers from heroin addiction and is part of a group of friends who lead a life characterized by improvisation and recklessness. Although he struggles to overcome his addiction, he manages to stay sober for a brief period, but eventually falls back on it. Meanwhile, his friends are also going through their own problems, such as Spud's unfortunate addiction, Begbie's violent outbursts, or Renton's relationship with a minor. Drug use is a complex and sensitive issue that affects society as a whole. It is important to reflect on the consequences of drug use both individually and collectively. Drug use can have negative effects on people's physical, mental and emotional health, as well as on their personal relationships and ability to function in society. In addition, drug use can have devastating effects on the community, such as increased crime and violence. Steps need to be taken to prevent drug use and to offer support and treatment to people struggling with addiction.",
553,26 April 2023,simonrua,9, What I liked the most about the movie.,"I think this movie has a very good introduction, giving it an intrigue as to what will happen, I also liked that there were so many people with such different personalities and they connect in such a distrustful way and the way they manifest what happens to some people afterward. To go a while without consuming drugs, which is called withdrawal syndrome, I also liked the parts in which the main character hallucinates in a manifestation of the hallucinatory state in which he finds himself, like in the scene where he puts his hand into a toilet to grab some pills and gradually enters the toilet and ends up getting completely into it and appears in a place that looks like the sea submerging to try to grab the pills that were at the bottom.",
554,27 April 2023,jorgemariosanchezmonsalve,10, the reality of young people,"The movie ""Trainspotting"" in my opinion is very good since it shows a before and after in the way of portraying the life of marginalized young people on the big screen. Through its raw and realistic narrative, the film manages to convey a strong message about the dangers of drugs and the dark world that lies behind them. It is a work that educates young people about the terrible consequences of addiction and shows without filters the harsh reality of those who find themselves in extreme situations. The film uses a variety of techniques to create an authentic environment; The use of music, photography, and editing help create a different feel to the story. The characters are presented with their defects and virtues exposed to the viewer, which contributes to a better understanding of the plot and the risks that are assumed in real life.",
555,27 April 2023,mateoblandonz,9, Opinion personal,"The truth seems to me that it is a very good film, since apart from entertaining, it leaves a very important reflective message, I would really give it five stars, but the ending was a bit shocking, although I don't like the ending, it also leaves another message for life, we never have to trustcompletely on other people, even if we live many experiences together, even if we commit bad or good acts together, at any moment he can leave you, just like mark did with his so-called friends, the part where Tommy decides to try drugs would also have changed, since thatIt could also be a lesson that even if you are surrounded by bad people, you can be the difference, but in this case it leaves us with an experience that even if we have good habits and do not consume anything, the people around us greatly affect our lives.",
556,27 April 2023,juanrios-38862,9, Drogas y experiencia de vida,"In my opinion, it is a film ahead of its time because it touches on strong issues that are still big problems in society today, such as drug addiction. Many young people enter the world of drugs because they do not know the consequences of these and because they only they look for a way to pass the time, some will do it to fit in or due to social pressure, others to try to escape from the hard life they may have, I think this film serves to make the population aware of the consequences of using drugs and not only because of its effects on the body but also because of the social relationships that can be formed, where normally they are not relationships for personal growth, they only come together to do illegal things.",
557,27 April 2023,miguelangeltalero,6," Interesting, but not enough","In my opinion, the movie is very engaging and well-made, it manages to realistically and starkly portray the dangers and consequences of drug addiction. Although I appreciate the originality and intensity of the story, I also believe that it can sometimes be too dark and disturbing for some viewers.",
558,27 April 2023,ecorreaarboleda,8, Trainspotting,"In my opinion, I feel that it deserves a four since it is quite good because it reflects great teaching on the subject of drugs, but it is not completely good, it does not deserve a five because it is not appropriate for all types of audienes, so young children who still They don't know this world, they can't have this vision about addictions, but this film really shows how difficult it is to get out of the world of drugs and that it is quite complex where many problems occur and it is very hard to survive in it, you don't have a life calm and at peace instead of solving your problems they happen to you more.",
559,2 May 2023,nicolasmanios,9, OPINION,"Trainspotting is a film that offers a powerful portrait of addiction and its consequences. The film does an excellent job of capturing the experience of drug use and addiction, highlighting the ups and downs of this often tumultuous world. One of the film's main strengths is its honest and unflinching portrayal of the characters and their struggles, giving viewers an empathetic understanding of their experiences. While the film can be hard to watch at times, its message of personal responsibility and the importance of seeking addiction help is important.",
560,8 May 2023,juanpablolopezgallego,9, Drugs adiction is a scary thing,"One of the highlights of Trainspotting is its realistic and uncensored portrayal of drug addiction.

However, the community and the support that can be given to each other is also presented.",
561,9 May 2023,gnvff,8, My perception,"I thought it was a super entertaining movie to watch, I had. Comic scenes that made the moment of seeing it much more pleasant, although there were also super heavy moments but that did not bother me that they were shown since for me the end of the film or the objective of this was to show the worst of drugs, addictions and bad companies in order to convey the message in another way and thus reach more young people, I also feel that this was a very good strategy from the teacher since we are a vulnerable population and with this it not only helps English but also when reflecting what we want with our lives.",

The music makes you feel like them and it's actually a really great choice of soundtrack. I love how the movie it's tell by Renton and His way to do it. How the stories of the characters develop, and how at the same time the external and internal conflicts in the group of ""friends"" develop is really one of the best things that the movie do. The film tackles dark and controversial issues in a bold and direct way, without judging the characters. Shows the devastating consequences of drug addiction.",
563,9 May 2023,callerestrepoluisa,10, Opinion,"The movie is really good, it shows the reality of the lives of adolescents who try drugs and the effects of drugs on the personal life of each one.

564,9 May 2023,areizakarolyn,10, My opinion,"I would give it 4 stars, on the one hand it shows us the sweet side of drugs, the side where everything is perfect, you see things in rosy colors, everything is carefree, living high on drugs is the best. But on the other hand, it shows us in a forceful way the terrible consequences of drugs, destroying that pleasant feeling, to show us that along with that pleasant feeling, it is destroying your life, like the things that really matter lose value. Once the screening is over, you realize that no matter how bad you are, no matter how sad your situation is... depending on drugs is not the solution.",
565,9 May 2023,vegamateo,10, me gusto,"Trainspotting"" is an incredibly raw and gritty film that delves into the dark underbelly of addiction. Set in Edinburgh, it follows a group of heroin addicts as they navigate their destructive lifestyles. The movie captivates with its unflinching portrayal of the characters' struggles, their chaotic relationships, and their desperate pursuit of escape. Ewan McGregor delivers a standout performance as the charismatic yet troubled Renton, bringing depth and complexity to the role. The film's fast-paced editing and iconic soundtrack enhance the visceral experience, creating a unique and haunting atmosphere. ""Trainspotting"" is a thought-provoking exploration of addiction and the consequences it imposes on individuals and society as a whole.",
566,10 May 2023,valentinaflorez-30375,9, My opinon,"I give it a 9, since I think the teaching and learning that it leaves behind is very important, the awareness that it can create in adolescents is very important since many get carried away by these situations of psychoactive substances and do not measure the consequences, the people enter this world believing that it is the best, that it gives happiness and in fact to be there is to be dead in life, since these drugs kill you and it is not easy to leave this place, and despite the fact that the movie teaches a good lesson , it has very unpleasant and unrealistic scenes and not many people can bear to see this kind of scene.",
567,10 May 2023,karola-15973,10, Trainspotting..............,"Trainspotting is a heavy movie, I loved the way they show the lives of these drug addicts. It's super realistic, but it also has a touch of madness that makes it totally unique. The characters are great, especially Renton, who is the typical person who wants to get out of his environment but doesn't know how. The bathroom scene is gross but also super shocking. It is a film that is unlike anything I have seen before, and that leaves you thinking for days, it seems to me that it touches on a very delicate subject which is reality and happens in many or all parts of the world and I would believe that it is a point that must be touched with all people, since for the same reason they can die or go crazy. I found it too interesting and I would see it a thousand more times. I was speechless.",
568,10 May 2023,michell-56771,10, the power of decisions,"My opinion about the film is that it was very good since from the first moment it immerses us in a dark and chaotic world, through lives and themes that are strong but are the reality of some people, this film shows us the face of the situation that nobody wants to see, for example, death, and that what will lead to that was a bad decision, and as I said before, a phrase that can describe this situation well is: the future of our life is in the decisions we make , and even if they are bad decisions, we have the power to change. And one of the things that I liked the most was the strength of the film, which lies in its ability to address controversial issues in a very real way.",
569,20 October 2002,RascalKing,10, Why are you watching this now?,"Truly one of the great films out there today. So many movie goers are wasting their time with big summer blockbusters when a little movie from '96 could possibly change their entire outlook on the film industry. An in your face, punk-rock poetic hour and a half that makes you hurt so bad you want to start it all over.",
570,16 August 2002,Brentford,10," Oh God, amazing.","I just finished watching Trainspotting. This film put me into the indescribable state that until now only films like 2001 could do.

I do think it is a wonderfull movie though, and so is the book.

Wonderfull acomplishment.",
572,28 February 2003,markrenton03,10, one of the best films ever!!,i dunno where to start really ... this film is just amazing ... its got great actors who play great characters especially rents & begbie who just cracks me up being scottish myself ... its also very funny aswell as being serious and a good anti drug message with a hot soundtrack aswell ... a must see 10 out of 10...,
573,5 January 2005,Oliver_Hanson,10, sublime,"I have to say that I have seen Trainspotting so, so many times and never get tired of watching it. People who don't like or understand this film are probably the same stupid people who get their news from tabloids or who think Britney Spears is a talented artiste. Why do I love Trainspotting so much - it captured and still captures the absolute alienation and cynicism so many millions of people feel, living in a cold, soulless, heartless, commercial chain store-dominated state answerable to no-one, which you are forced to be part of, often against your will. It comments magnificently on the hypocrisy of society (""my mother in her own socially acceptable way is ALSO a drug addict"") and the ignorance of the ""moral majority"" towards drugs. Drugs are complex things - heroin DOES have some redeeming features - so deal with it! The serious message is offset by a very dry and intelligent humour, which still has me in stitches today - often the greatest mirth is to be found in the most profound despair - Our PC times try to deny this but it is true. This says so much about Britain and our lack of naiveté - the contrast with other European countries is starkly illustrated.. Above all though this is a profoundly moving film - which explores the sheer extremes of the human soul. For me it is up there with Casablanca, Some like it hot and Taxi Driver as one of the all time great films. Superb acting, top soundtrack Underworld ""Dark Train"" a techno classic and above all a poignant message.",
574,17 July 2017,markorankovic,10, Absolutely brilliant British film,"This is the most unique film and one of my favourite films that I have ever seen! Reasons? Film contains a huge message and on the other hand there is quality humor, very remarkable quotes including first and last scene, brilliant music from the 70s rock n roll up to 90s club house and techno music, and ""easter eggs"" that are hidden in the film. I have read the book also so I like how Boyle focused on just one of the problems from the book and screened it in sort of the funny and brutally way and showed all the consequences that drug abuse brings. It is mature film but I think that because of the message of the film even younger people should see it. And remember, the world's changing. Music's changing. Even drugs are changing. So choose watching this film if you haven't by now and then watch sequel to see how the gang changed! 10/10",
575,6 June 2006,musetv13,10, Best Drugs movie ever,Best Drugs movie ever.. it is simply the best exemplification on how drugs work on you and make your life!!! the movie also shows the consumer's way of think and how young people oppressed by non-real values hiding themselves into another reality!!! it trying to showing us how it can be ... but it is also trying to explaining that they are like us they are oppressed by heroin and maybe the cannot leave it behind... sometimes they need help ... sometimes they don't... but the real moral of the movie... and what the author of that amazing book Irvine Welsh want to teach us it s that we are destroyed internally by material life and we don't have no more thinking about something superior that we need!! amazing movie,
576,22 July 2018,mstaesse,10, A masterpiece.,"Based on the novel by Irvine Welsh, this movie shows you the story the daily lifes of Mark Renton, who is a heroin addict, and his junkie/violent friends in Edinburgh. Heroin is the real reason why they stay together, because when Mark attempts to become clean, he realises there isn't much of in his life and friends that he likes. Becoming clean isn't easy for renton, because of the negatif influence of his friends. So he only sees one way out of his missery, betrayal. ",
