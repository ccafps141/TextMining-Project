0,27 February 2016,Hitchcoc,10, A Story of Passion and Commitment,"I can't add a lot to what has been written. The direction and cinematography aside (which is magnificent), this is an incredible psychological study, involving a group of the most complex of characters. Esposito finds himself in love with two people: the woman who was once his boss and because of inaction, left him heartbroken, and, secondly, a beautiful young rape/murder victim. Over a twenty-five year period, these forces never leave him. The rapist is his Moby Dick to his Captain Ahab. Since we don't see a lot of what happens in the intervening time, we must wonder how empty and fruitless his life has been until he has his epiphany. Mixed in all this are the politics of Argentina and the vengeance of a horrible man. Also, in the middle is the messed friend, an alcoholic, who can be a true talent, but is submerged in his problems, spending his time in bars. If we look to literature we might consider him the Sydney Carton of this film. When you see what happens to him, you will see why I choose this character as a reference. This is one of the finest films I've ever seen. It has it all.",/
1,19 August 2009,billion_mucks,8, Speaking Eyes,"""El Secreto de sus Ojos"" hit me with unspeakable strength. I didn't expect to like it so much, so I owe a review to those in analysis measures before seeing it or those interested in some opinion.",r
2,21 November 2017,classicsoncall,10," ""How do you live a life full of nothing?""","This is only the second Argentinian movie I've seen, both within the past week (the other was ""Wild Tales""), and so far I'm batting a thousand by picking two immensely satisfying films. I was reading some of the negative reviews and I had to laugh, more than one stated that the ending was completely predictable. Yeah right, like anyone could foresee that Morales would kidnap the guy who murdered his wife and keep him a prisoner for twenty five years. Come on, nobody could see that coming.",e
3,18 September 2010,claudio_carvalho,9, How to Live an Empty Life?,"The retired justice officer Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darin) decides to write a novel based on the Morales Case of twenty-five years ago and has difficulties to find the right beginning. He visits his former chief Irene Menéndez-Hastings (Soledad Villamil) in the tribunal to show his draft. In the 70's, Benjamín has an unrequited love for his new-hired chief Irene that belongs to an upper-class. Benjamin is assigned to investigate the murder of Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo), a beautiful woman recently married with Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) that had been brutally raped and murdered. Benjamin and his alcoholic partner Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) feel touched with the grief of Ricardo and go further in their investigation. Benjamin observes that a man named Isidoro Gómez (Javier Godino) is staring Liliana in many pictures and he becomes the prime-suspect. Meanwhile the tension between Ricardo and Irene increases along the days but Ricardo does not understand the signs of her eyes. Twenty five years later, Ricardo is still haunted by his love for Irene and for the unsatisfactory resolution of the Morales Case.",v
4,16 February 2016,A_Different_Drummer,10, you really don't need another review,"Not often I come to an IMDb review page and think what can I possibly add to all the comments that came before? The movie is staggering in its ability to engage and while engaging to constantly fiddle with the expectations of the viewer. It is the rarest of movies, a slow movie that is never boring and one you never want it to end.",i
5,15 August 2009,jpschapira,9, The secret of Juan José,"In my country, Juan José Campanella is synonym of 'cinema of the highest order'. The director works in USA and from time to time he brings a new film. We know, dramatically, what we're going to watch: Ricardo Darín in an important role, a lot of sentimentalism, references to the country's past, a love story. And technically, if it's the highest order, there won't be any complaints. When the film ended, the people in the movie theater started clapping.",e
6,6 September 2009,bicgus1,9, Extraordinary Film,"Last night I went to watch this flick, and I must say that all in all, I ended up quite surprised because of it's impressive quality. Taking into account that I was already expecting superior film, indeed, it came out to be even more outstanding than I thought, mainly because of the rare combination of noir genre with very precise and measured funny moments and especially an incredibly faithful description of the Argentine system of justice and the characters that compose it. This last element is just perfect. The movie keeps your attention all the time -no decays at all- and the set design is also great, to such extent that it left me wondering what the tricks of the trade employed to achieve such similarity are. Foreign watchers might not fully understand some great details that are mainly local, but anyway they will surely enjoy the thrilling aspects of the film. It would be enough for them to say that almost all this locale's are just true, no matter how incredible they might look.",w
7,4 December 2009,casch0101,10," Absolutely impeccable, great film!","I agree with SanFava. I am a follower of Campanella's and Darin. I have seen all previous three films. However, this one surpasses them all!. This is a great script, top-notch acting by everyone, partly thanks to the excellent casting. Superb cinematography. The film basically explores what ""passion"" is to the human being. A great passion (on various areas) is involved in almost all characters. You have suspense, a clever detective story, some surprising twists, etc. Darin has an ""aura"" (paraphrasing the the title of the film he worked in, ""The Aura"") that illuminates the whole screen. His presence is as powerful in the screen as that of Gene Hackman, Pacino, DeNiro or Hoffman (the top, great ones). I sincerely hope this movie gets his due awards (Oscar included), because it deserves so!).",/
8,6 April 2010,lee_eisenberg,9, Argentinian passion,"The second Argentinian movie to win an Oscar, ""El secreto de sus ojos"" (""The Secret in Their Eyes"" in English) looks at a Buenos Aires detective's passion in solving a case on the verge of the military junta that was responsible for the Disappeared. As I understand it, a difference between this movie and Juan Jose Campanella's previous ones is that this is more mainstream, so to speak. I actually found it pretty comparable to ""My Wife's Boyfriend"", which Campanella also directed. I certainly recommend both films. To be certain, this one has some of the best lines that I've ever heard. Argentina has clearly shown itself to be a fine country in terms of cinema during this past decade.",r
9,12 March 2010,jotix100,8, The secret of his eyes,"A retired investigator, Benjamin Esposito, from a criminal court in Buenos Aires, decides to write about a case that has haunted him since the days he was assigned to cover the crime. In putting his thoughts in paper, he realizes the case is still unresolved. What's more, he is more involved now, than he was back then. For that he must go back and speak to Irene, the district attorney, under whose office he worked. Irene, he realizes, is the woman he has never forgotten in spite of being apart for so many years.",w

11,5 March 2010,FilmRap,8, Deserves the Acclaim It Has Received,"When Juan Jose Campanella is not directing episodes of Law and Order, CSI or the like, he periodically returns to Argentina make a movie. In this case he directed and co-wrote the screenplay of The Secret in Their Eyes. Thus far it is the most successful movie in Argentina in the past thirty-five years and now in just few days after we saw it, we will find out if this Academy Award nominated movie for the Best Foreign Film will win an Oscar. It reminds us of the French movie, Tell No One, one of our all time favorites, as it is also a sophisticated detective story with an easy flowing but yet a complicated plot that keeps you thinking and guessing throughout the story. It is in Spanish, of course, with good subtitles. This movie is not only a mystery, crime movie but it is also a subtle romantic film which is has very good comedic moments. There is the use of a narrative technique that allows you to see the story through the imagination and the memory of the main character Benjamin Esposito played by well-known Argentine actor Ricardo Darin. There are skillfully done movements, which go back and forth in time as well as shifting the point of view, which on a few occasions took a few moments for us to orient ourselves. The acting, directing and photography were superb with great realism and therefore it surprised us to learn that the budget was only two million dollars. As required for all good movies of this genre, there is a strong ending, which will hold your interest and encourage further reflection.",3
12,26 October 2009,sanarg,10, This is what movies should always be,"This is it. A film that you can't get your eyes off until lights are back on... and then it's still difficult to stand up. A thriller, with lovable main characters, that makes you smile and think. A movie about a crime and a love. It has one of best chase scenes I've ever seen, involving what seems to be real complex camera work, something that could've been part of a Lord of the Rings movie maybe (at least that is what it looked like from my seat). Simply amazing. The acting is perfect. The pace is perfect. The ending couldn't be better (and we have seen so many great films that spoil it all at the end!).",0

14,26 September 2009,torrelodones49,10, A masterpiece,"This is quite frankly an astonishing film. One that fills your entire array of senses and sensitivities, and the praise from Argentine reviewers here is 100 percent justified. Ricardo Darín turns in another majestic performance as a Buenos Aires court employee who is fiercely affected by the rape and murder of a young girl in 1974, a tragedy that dominates his life. Overlapping this theme is the powerfully sensual but never physical relationship between Darín and his superior, the investigating judge played by the superb Soledad Villamil. The connection between the two is electric. It's a pity this film cannot easily transcend the language barrier, if it was an English-language film of the same quality it would already be hailed as a masterpiece. The blending of tragedy, love, violence and humour is brilliant, and the comedy dialogue fantastic. One scene where Ricardo Darín is balled out for having searched an old lady's house is priceless in terms of comic timing and delivery. A wonderful performance also from Guillermo Francella as the court clerk with a drinking problem, in fact the secondary acting is all first-class. The camera-work is impressive, especially the swoop down into the football stadium and the closeups, and the script is also superb. Argentina has nominated the film as its candidate for best foreign film at the Oscar's, it deserves to walk it.",1
15,24 October 2010,kosmasp,9, Secrets revealed,"I guess you might see some things coming. But this is not that much about the secrets (at least for me), but the journey of our main protagonist. It is about life and choices you make and how one simple choice does get you into a path you actually do not want to follow. But because it is expected of you (of what your appearance is in other peoples eyes), you keep on walking. Maybe regretting the decision while you are walking, but walking that path nevertheless.",7
16,10 June 2010,smatson123,10," ""Sus Ojos"" as Literature on the Screen (long)","To get the big picture before beginning this piece, I did a quick sweep of previous reviews and immediately had to ask myself: why does the same film generate such passionate applause on the one hand, and such punishing comments on the other? I suppose it goes back to the question of ""sus ojos"" (your eyes). Those looking for an American style murder mystery or a boy-meets-girl, loses-girl, finds-girl romance may in fact have their eyes closed to some important possibilities. But those willing to see film as a novel have an experience to look forward to an experience that satisfies and enlightens on every level.",9
17,4 December 2009,tjdinvt,10, as good as anything out there,"Simply put, this is one of the finest films I've ever seen. I don't say that lightly, I don't exaggerate when it comes to talking about movies -- but everything about this one, from the acting to the writing, to the camera work, to the directorial decisions, is grade A. The story deals with deep matters, and it does so one step at a time, with a plot that moves steadily forward, gathering force, substance and intensity, not settling for easy answers or plot points, not cutting corners. The characters are complicated, interesting, believable, flawed, funny, tragic and deeply human.",/
18,14 March 2010,somkaviraj,10, A Masterpiece...,"I am a big movie aficionado and watch a lot of movies. I guess you can say movies are my passion. After watching The Secret in their Eyes, though I confess I had my reservations as the movie was in a foreign language and I felt I won't be able to enjoy much as the real emotions and feelings mostly can't be conveyed in translations. Thus with such thoughts I proceeded to watch the movie. ",?
19,9 August 2010,ma-cortes,8," Splendid film full of emotion , love , intrigue and feeling of joy and sorrow","Perceptible drama with suspense filmed with sensitivity and feeling. The story, set in 1999, is told in flashback way : in June 1974 a Justice Officer , Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darin), becomes entangled in the investigation of the crime of an ill-fated wife named Liliana , cruelly raped and killed inside her home in a Buenos Aires neighborhood. Her widowed husband named Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago), is shocked by the crime ; Espósito promises to find the murderous and bring him to justice. Benjamin is helped by his drunk assistant Pablo Sandoval and a newcomer, the upper class Secretary of Court named Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil) who is hired at the Criminal Court . Despite the department already having two other suspects Benjamin seeks tips off . Espósito's rivaling partner Romano pins the killing on two immigrant employees so as to get rid of the case , an issue that infuriates Espósito, hitting Romano in a fury. He finds a track while seeing some photos provided by Morales: he comes across a strange young man identified as Isidoro Gomez(Javier Godino) who watch the victim in a rare manner in various pictures. Espósito investigates the whereabouts of Gómez, and learns that he is residing in Buenos Aires, but fails to chase him. Espósito and Sandoval break into Gómez' household in an illegal entrance and take some letters that lead a clue about his liking to Racing Club . The other issue is that Gómez is still at large, and they set out in pursuit . Meanwhile Benjamin Esposito is writing a novel, using the matter as the source material. Benjamin was personally affected by the case as he tracked the killer, hence the reason why the unsatisfactory ending to the case has always bothered him. ",r
20,16 June 2021,herrick416,10, Absolutely chilling and worthy of every moment spent seeing it.,"Just like others here there's little left to add to these fine reviews except to mention a particularly terrifying scene -well more an image - that I found absolutely chilling and haven't seen it mentioned yet, one that 1st revealed the monster who committed a truly brutal crime. But beauty and humor quickly replace the chill of that scene, a chill that returns soon after during an impromptu interrogation. You'll know it when you see it and I've given nothing away ...not a spoiler in sight. I'm merely pointing out what stayed with me that I hadn't seen noted by others. See, this is a movie that grabs you right from the start and keeps you through all sorts of tones that change and are just too touching to break down into categories. But I think that only actors of this caliber could pull it off and drag me around through beauty through ugliness back to beauty and my affection or repulsion never wains. Oh dear the American version is a waste of time. I don't know why it was even attempted but this is pure masterpiece and twists to boot. Don't miss it. .",e

It began like a simple crime story but the wonderful use of subjects, symbols and strong references turned it in to a masterpiece. Details about Eva Peron's Argentina and questioning of the terms of law and justice. My interest is increasing for Latin American Cinema when I watch such beautiful works. By the way I watched this movie in It's original language. Subtitles were translated into English. I think by using ""Google Translate"" which sucks.

29,17 October 2017,mallaverack,6, Take a cold shower folks - unbelievable praise....,"What's this - ten stars for a movie in which the most vital turning point appears completely out of left field!? Gomez rapes and murders a young woman in the most brutal and sadistic way imaginable but because he is useful to the political regime as an informer, he is released!!! For non-Argentinian viewers, the time (1970s) in which this horrendous crime was committed was barely touched upon thereby providing no context for the later release of the prisoner. This is a HUGE weakness in an other wise well-produced movie. For me, from this glaringly incredulous stage of the plot, I struggled to maintain interest.",v
30,11 March 2010,jmr7123,10," Deserves the Oscar, and More","El Secreto de sus Ojos is a great film. If you examine the filmography of the director, Jean Jose Campanella, you can see that all his years directing TV in Hollywood has taught him the craft of classic Hollywood style on a high level. But the movie is authentically Argentinian, both in style and in content. Ricardo Darin and Soledad Villamil are both deeply familiar actors in Argentina, and the romantic melodrama is quite typical, but the tautness of the suspense and the intelligent plot twists bring out the best in both actors, as well as an amazing supporting cast. And I loved the portrayal of politics. Without giving any more away, the scene in the elevator is one of the most effective portrayals of what fascism really feels like.",

36,1 June 2015,Coventry,9, True romance is about  suffering,"I was curious and intrigued, but mostly skeptical when I first read the brief description of ""The Secret in their Eyes"" in a TV- magazine. It stated: ""a romantic thriller about the unresolved rape and murder case of a beautiful girl 25 years ago"". Huh? How can a thriller, especially one dealing with such painful topics like rape and murder, be romantic? And yet, the description is 100% accurate and truthful. This harsh thriller is simultaneously one of the most emotional stories that I ever witnessed and it's romantic at no less than three different levels! There's the obvious but oppressed romance between lead character Benjamin Esposito and his court superior Irene Hastings, and then there's also the more convoluted but undeniably romantic devotion that widower Ricardo Morales shows for his murdered wife and the perverted (but yet somehow romantic) motive of culprit Isidoro Gómez for committing the inhuman crime. One things for sure, ""The Secret in their Eyes"" is one of the most absorbing, beautiful and unforgettable films of the new millennium. I was wondering how on earth it could be possible that Michael Haneke's masterful ""The White Ribbon"" didn't win the Oscar for best foreign film for 2009, but now it makes perfect sense. Those people at the Academy were more than right to award this film instead! ""The Secret in their Eyes"" deserves every price that it won and it also deserves to be seen by as many people as humanly possible! ",

The camera work is fantastic throughout, and there is one scene with a single sweeping shot from high above a football stadium down to crowd level which is truly amazing.

And how that act of remembering can change the present. What is that timeless quality that we sometimes see in a person's eyes?

Darin and Villamil give good performances as government co-workers whose relationship is fraught with unconsummated sexual tension. It is an intriguing story, but the execution is sloppy. There are too many loose ends and the plot elements pertaining to the murder suspect are so ludicrously contrived in terms of how he is targeted, caught, and convicted that it's hard to take this film seriously. Furthermore, after all the buildup, the conclusion is rather underwhelming. It's not a bad film by any means, but it falls far short of its lofty reputation.",

In 1974, Judiciary employee Benjamín Espósito begins investigating the rape and murder of a young woman named Liliana Coloto. Assisting him in the investigation are his assistant Pablo Sandoval and his superior Irene Menéndez Hastings. Twenty-five years later, Espósito decides to use the case as the basis for his first novel, leading to a reunion with Hastings and the revelations that arise from discovering events that were set in motion twenty-five years prior. Although the majority of the film's runtime is devoted to the 1970s timeline, director Juan José Campanella, who also served as the film's co-writer and editor, finds a masterful balance between the two, crafting a non-linear narrative that provides a satisfying resolution to both threads.",

All I can say is that we are still in awe and is now in my top 3 of all time with ""One flew Over The Cuckoos Nest"" & ""12 Angry Men"" A must see film for any serious film buff and a rare film that touches all emotions and senses. We are privileged to have seen this.",
57,12 May 2010,druid333-2,10, The Mirrors Of The Soul,"Are you in the mood for a well written,directed & acted drama,with a hint of romance & intrigue? You can't do much better than 'El secreto de sus ojos' (released in English speaking countries as 'The Secret In Their Eyes'),a film that was Argentina's entry for the Academy Awards for best film from that country. It tells the story of a retired defense attorney (Benjamin Esposito,played by the fine Argentine actor,Ricardo Darin,of 'XXY',and 'Nine Queens'fame) who is writing his memoirs,in hopes of turning them into a book. When he becomes interested in trying to re-open the case of a brutal rape/murder,he goes to his former employer for leads (Irene Menendez-Hastings,played by Soledad Villamil). What Benjamin discovers is lost feelings he felt for Irene). Cutting back & forth in time,we see stories of the young Benjamin & Irene working for the same government law firm,and the ups & downs of the law profession in 1970's Argentina,during their dirty war,which is never mentioned. This is a smart,well written screenplay (by the film's director,Juan Jose Campanella,mostly known for his work in both Argentinian,as well as American television,and Eduardo Sacheri,from the novel by Sacheri). Besides the above mentioned cast,the film also features Pablo Rago,Javier Godino,Barbara Palladino,Rudy Romano & Juan Jose Ortiz. Juan Jose Campanella wears three hats as director,co-writer & film editor. The film's lush cinematography is by Felix Monti. This is bravura film making for thinking persons who demand more from film than just car chases,explosions,fart jokes & other mindless droppings from Hollywood. Spoken in Spanish with English subtitles. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains some strong language,flashes of an unpleasant rape scene,nudity & bloody violence",

What you see in the movie is exactly what it is: You can spot a fan because fans of a football team or hooligans, when their team plays as visitor in another team's stadium, the visitor's fans have a sector assigned ( up, in one of the sides), therefore it was enough to look for the assassin in that sector alone, and not in the whole stadium. The players' commentaries of Racing which appear in the letters, belong to old times football players, of whom Gomez was a fan when he was a teen-ager. It would not be surprising that he was commenting on any alternative of a game with his mother which they could have just watched, and that had been discussed with the rest of the family, for instance, in which case, she knew exactly what he was talking about when he was recalling this or that football player.",

The movie traps you right from the beginning, but the end is so logical that, even if it made me feel sad for the implications, I had no words to express the feeling that the logical conclusion produced on my person. There is a message in what the spectator sees at the end. If you think this movie is a thriller or a love story is because you did not understand it. When you understand the logic behind it then you realize the greatness of this movie. Some people may think it is about past times in Argentina. At least this was what my brother, who had recommended me the movie, told me when I asked him why he had enjoyed the movie. I felt sorry at the end because, it is not about the past, it also embraces the present.",

68,6 August 2010,paul2001sw-1,9, Truly brooding,"The splendid Ricardo Darin, star of the late great Fabien Bielinski's two movies, is back on fine form in this film. Superficially it's more conventional than Bielinski's films, being a straightforward story of a veteran (ex-) policeman who can't let his most interesting unsolved case lie. For sure, the plot is tricksy and there's evidence of corruption in high places; but this is all run-of-the-mill for this genre. What's unusual about this film is it's focus on character: the brooding hero is another stereotype, but Darin's character's relationship to his case is complex; the supporting cast are also great, and the sense of a life wasted, in part, because the hero's boldness in his job is not matched by a similar confidence in matters of the heart is well conveyed. The film is also superbly shot, there's a sequence filmed in a football stadium where the use of the camera to exploit the venue is frankly brilliant. Overall, I think that Bielinski's films with Darin were even better, but they also set a high bar; but 'The Secret in Their Eyes' certainly confirms his uncanny ability to shamble onto the screen and steal it completely.",

I had to adapt a little bit in the beginning because it all goes so fast but once you are in the story you get sucked into it. It's a long movie but it doesn't matter because the story stays good until the end. The end is even better then the beginning. The whole mystery about the murderer/rapist keeps you alert and the side love-story between Irene Menéndez Hastings (played by Soledad Villamil) and Benjamín Esposito (played by Ricardo Darín) gives the movie even more drama. Beautifully played by both of them by the way. Very nice filming and acting. I will certainly watch it again in the future.,

The Secret in Their Eyes is one of those kinds of movies, and while I wasn't impressed quite enough to agree with the Academy (awarding it Best Foreign film at the Oscars over truly magnificent films like The White Ribbon and Un Prophete), it gives an audience what it wants: believable and unpredictable characters, and a story that flips around through time but doesn't get too confusing. Certainly this is the kind of mystery movie, like a recent Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, that could potentially play to mass audiences (say, a small theater at a cineplex at a mall) and do pretty decently.

I don't speak or understand Spanish and I don't watch many foreign language films, but I somehow managed to get myself in a mood to watch this and I am so glad I did. This movie as mentioned here, had two underlying themes, one is about the obvious rape and murder mystery, and the other more effective theme is the unspoken love between the main character and his supervisor. As for the story itself, its about the rape and murder of a young woman, and revolves around the police team (a detective, his supervisor and his drunk assistant) who try to solve it, her husband and the killer. It is not so much about trying to find out who the killer is, rather about the emotions involved with the people concerned. The untold love story between the detective and his supervisor captures as much attention as the murder mystery and is beautifully told.

This is one of my favourite movies of the last decade: made with a slow pace and always careful not to let the cruelty of the crime to take over and tell the story. We meet the main characters in Buenos Aires in 1999 when Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin) is trying to write a book about a 30 years old cold case occurred while he was a legal counsellor. Benjamin has been haunted by the past and is in desperate need of closure, still in love with his ex-colleague Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil) and hoping to finally let the victim rest in peace. A young couple's dream of happiness is savagely destroyed and what remains of it carries such a deep and honest grief that no one is left untouched. Pablo Rago is brilliant playing the young widower Ricardo Morales, his inconsolable but calm way to grieve introduces us to a man made of love and patience while Ricardo Darin, never over the top, portraits a middle age man lost in a limbo of memories and who has waited for years to see his passions for Irene and for justice to prevail. Passion and melancholy are the elements that have made this movie a masterpiece, and the poetry of a director like Jose Campanella has borrowed nothing from overseas: this is an Argentinian movie with an Argentinian heart and this is why it has to be seen in his original language to be truly appreciated because nothing like the Buenos Aires's accent will rock you through the events. My vote 9.5/10",

It is by far the best movie I've seen. The acting is outstanding. Ricardo Darin always delivers, but this one was just amazing. Even though the storyline moves back and forth in time, it's so that the viewer understands exactly why things happen. You laugh, you cry, you cringe. It's a roller coaster of emotions. The dialogue is amusing and spot on. The closeup of the different characters eyes at peak moments is subtle but so telling.

Jose Luis Campanella does a tremendous job of intertwining a love story between the two main characters, together with a crime thriller. As a means of telling the story, the director switches from past to present and present to past, each time revealing a new aspect of each storyline. Throughout the movie it is easy to focus on the crime thriller storyline and think that it is the only thing going on. However, through subtle looks in the eyes of the main characters we are able to see that there is love brewing up in them and that this will become a main theme in no time.

124,3 February 2013,nesfilmreviews,8," A wonderful, richly layered mystery.","""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is directed by Juan José Campanella--it is a splendid multifaceted film which skillfully alternates between the present and past, as it seamlessly intertwines a murder mystery, love story, and judicial injustice. All of these elements of the story are flushed-out--creating depth, and all play a crucial part in Juan José Campanella's adaptation of Eduardo Sacheri's novel. A film that effectively juggles both affection and misery, using Benjamin's conflicted heart as a way to humanize the chilling details, while observing a man not only starved for justice, but after a woman he abandoned decades earlier. Benjamín (Ricardo Darín), a retired court investigator, is trying to write a novel about an old case of his that was never resolved to his satisfaction. More than two decades ago, a woman was brutally raped and murdered, and although suspects were found, the case against them was thrown out on technical grounds. However, Benjamín always suspected someone else entirely. Benjamín and his assistant Pablo Rago (Ricardo Morles), ultimately were certain that a man named Isidoro Gómez was the real killer. For help, he returns to his old office and bounces his thoughts off Irene (Soledad Villamil), whom he has always loved despite never acting on those feelings. The past and the present begin to merge as pieces of the case are re-investigated, forcing Benjamín to reflect on his past, and what could have been. But Benjamín's search for the truth will put him at the center of a judicial nightmare, as the mystery of the heinous crime committed 25 years ago continues to haunt him in the present. Interweaving past and present, we see how the investigation affects Benjamín, as well as Irene, over the period of decades. Stealthily weaving Esposito's relationship with Irene into the on-going murder mystery, it takes on a life of it's own--a compulsive narrative that manages to be genuinely surprising. Haunting and gracefully, the film reveals its secrets slowly. Lengthly, but engaging, wonderful storytelling, and extremely well-done. The entire cast is uniformly superb, enhancing this foreign thriller--with its intelligent, layered screenplay. Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film (2010). **This was a unpredicted and surprising winner of the Oscar. It beat out two great films also in contention that year. Respectively-- ""A Prophet"" and ""The White Ribbon.""",

126,25 August 2013,erengencturk,10, Perfect Love,"Was very surprised by how much I enjoyed it. A lot of things happen on the screen, but the emotions are very subtle. In essence, it's another take on the age old question, ""How far would you go for the one you love?"" Here, we have two completely different angles to it. One man who walks away while another can never forget. I did not expect the ending, and while I'm generally not keen on any ""twist"" finales, this is one I'm willing to overlook because it makes sense. We should have known, in fact, that his love was that strong. Absolutely. It's an emotionally honest and subtle drama which centers around the idea that people search for a substitute in order to not fulfill what they are really looking for. The love story between Esposito and Irene who need many years to utter their feelings for each other on the one hand, and the cruel story of cold-blooded murder contrast in a brilliant way, and somehow all of the paths the film shows lead to one point, the disturbing scene where Esposito discovers the victim. The film is more complex and allegorical than one is used from that ""genre type"", and also manages to integrate the ""porteño"" humor perfectly.

134,8 January 2011,meeza,10, A secret masterpiece!,"You are just too good to be true, can't keep my eyes off of you! And boy is that true in viewing the mastery of the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language motion picture ""The Secret in Their Eyes"". The Argentinean flick is directed by Juan Jose Campanella. If Campanella's name does ring a bell, it is because he is not only an acclaimed Argentinean auteur but also has directed numerous episodes of the critically-acclaimed television series ""House M.D."". Campanella also co-wrote ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" with Eduardo Sacheri. This movie is unlike any you have laid your eyes on before! Campanella masters the craft of developing unpredictable journeys on where the narrative of this film takes you to. ""The Secret in their Eyes"" stars Ricardo Darin as Benjamin Esposito, a retired lawyer who decides to write a novel on a murder case he was assigned to many years ago that still haunts him in his present life. In returning to the undiscovered aftermath scenarios of the case, Benjamin's buttons are pushed in so many variations. I will not divulge too much on the case because that will be a bit of plot snitching on the secret of ""The Secret in Their Eyes"". I will state that in rediscovering the case, he reunites with a past female attorney colleague Irene Menendez Hastings. Benjamin always held a secret love for Irene but was not hasty enough to express his love for her, due to the nature of the infamous case. During the time Benjamin and Irene were working on the case, they had the assistance of a wisecracking, inebriated attorney colleague Ricardo Morales. He provides the film's comic relief of an emotionally-wrenched narrative. Campanella and Sacheri's screenplay is as intense and compelling as they come! And Campanella's directorial vision of ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" was 20/20 perfect! His skilled orchestration of interchanging between past and present was one of the movie's finest assets. The cast of ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" was phenomenal! Darin's daring starring performance as Esposito was undeniably outstanding. But he was not alone, because Soledad Villamil's work as the captivating Irene was up to par with Darin's effort. And not to be left undone, Pablo Rago was exactly no rag doll with his scene-stealing performance as Morales. ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" was most worthy of its Best Foreign Film Academy Award, and that is no secret. ***** Excellent",

Juan Jose Campanella (who also directed Luna de Avellaneda and El Hijo de la Novia, along with many Law and Order and House MD television episodes) directs this thriller which has been a box office hit in Argentina. It has also received a lot of critical acclaim because of the way the story is told in non-linear form and it also has some great performances from the entire cast; but what makes this movie so much better is the clever ending because in order for a thriller to work you need to have a decent ending and this movie has a great one. The entire build up to the finale is just sensational and the movie doesn't drag for one minute during the entire two hours the movie lasts. It mixes romance with action and drama with suspense and balances them all very well. There is one specific action scene in a soccer stadium where a chase takes place that is just breathtaking. I haven't seen an Argentinean movie so good since Nueve Reinas (Nine Queens). This movie is very clever and I recommend you seeing it in its original language (Spanish) because the performances are so good and the dialogues are so real (If you've been to Argentina you know most of the conversations take place in the exact same manner, it just has a very authentic feel to it).",

144,3 September 2018,oggybleacher,9, The Missing 'A',"So many details to enjoy from this movie that multiple viewings give reward. There is a deliberate disjointed time continuity narrative with foreshadowing that at first seems like it is happening in real time but one later realizes it is a flashback to a point in time that one of the narrative timelines has not yet reached. So one must pay attention. What I loved most is the directorial and editing approach that does not bounce around. The elevator scene, for example, is a single, agonizing, suspenseful cut. There are many single, long scenes where there are no arbitrary close ups or nonsense editing to relieve the actors of the job of acting for more than 4 seconds. The actors are acting even when they don't have a line and the director knows this so includes them in the scene. Hollywood has cursed our attention span so, that's the part I appreciate most, the ability to watch a scene unfold for minutes on end with quality script and the characters always acting their character. It's a tight script with what might seem like frivolous details all wrap around and become important in one way or another...many facets, a crime story with romantic intrigue and political complications. Even futbol is given a nod! Very good performances from everyone, even the out-of-focus court aides/interns who are treated like dirt as a rule and casually go about their business. The missing 'A' motif is brilliant. Watch again and again, like Silence of The Lambs. Even though I know the climax the dialogue is so enjoyable and the approach is so mature that I will always enjoy this movie. Bravisimo!",

This movie is from Argentina and enlightened me in ways that I never knew possible, chiefly that Argentina has a film industry. Once I got past this shocking revelation I was ready to watch the movie. So this movie won awards all over the globe including the Oscar for best foreign film, and literally every award offered by the Argentinian film awards (which suggests to me maybe Argentina doesn't have a film industry so much as makes a movie a year). This movie was one of the best I have seen in years. It has flash backs that are actually purposeful and not confusing. It has humor. It has suspense. It has mystery. It has not one but two great love stories. It has violence. And it brought me into the world of Argentina, a world I am not that familiar with other than the rumors that Hitler is secret living there. I loved this movie, from the first shot to the ending, that I thought would be all typical Hollywood bull crap, but surprised me completely and made me go ""hmmmmm.. I did not see that coming,"" which is something I wish I could say more often with thrillers. This movie is a must see unless you hate subtitles. I can see Hollywood making a version of this and ruining it, so see it before Hollywood rapes and kills this movie.

There were so many unexpected twists and turns and I loved the way that the title of the movie was tied into both story lines – the life of the main character Esposito and that of the case he had been investigating. The characters are well developed and believable and the actors portray them perfectly. This film is one that carries a lot of weight and feeling and the ending is both fitting and disturbing. It makes you question how you feel about justice and punishment and whether you agree with the sentence. The movie is filled with suspense and draws the audience into every twist and turn and despite the complexity you are never lost in the story. Definitely one to watch!,

However, for most of its runtime from then on, ""El secreto de sus ojos"" feels both cheesy and pointless, presenting the murder case as (presumably) solved and focusing way too much on the seemingly eternal (yet never consummated) romantic attraction between the male and female protagonist. It's not that it gets boring; it just loses its focus for a little too long, and, not being a fan of the ""romance"" genre, I'll admit this bothered me.",

What this movie misses pretty much are serious corrections regarding scenario. Most of dialogs are too long and confusing and completely unnecessary making pretty easy plot very complicated to follow. Some scenes look very amateurish therefore. That makes whole movie too long without any necessity and the movie pace too slow making some of the scenes look like Telenovelas.

160,26 June 2010,Miakmynov,10, Film of the year,"With the previous two Best Foreign Film Oscars going to films that I thought were good rather than great, I was beginning to fear that the Academy Awards were losing their discernment. No worries though, for they got this one spot on – easily the best film of the dozen or so that I saw during this years' Edinburgh Film Festival, and probably the best film I will see this year. This is truly outstanding film-making that, like its' title, keeps you guessing, and works on a number of different levels - whose eyes contain the secret; the victim, the killer or the lovers? Content-wise, it broadly covers the nature of justice, in a plot that is slightly reminiscent of 'A Very Long Engagement' – a convoluted whodunit, played out over a long time period. But it's also about the nature of memory, and how effective or not it is, with a number of sequences that play on this uncertainty – did it really happen, or is it just in the imagination of the character? Whilst the mystery element of the film is rich and engrossing in itself, it shines even brighter in the love story. The Director manages to create a brilliant chemistry between the two leads, with their age-ing captured to perfection and providing an immediate reference point for the viewer to help make sense as the narratives moves seamlessly back and forth, sweeping through time.",

163,4 April 2011,johnnyboyz,6, Perfectly fine and perfectly rounded little thriller with more grandeur-a aspirations to be what isn't quite; The Secret in Their Eyes makes the grade more often than not.,"There can't be many actors working within Argentina, indeed the world, with a presence-come-expression, or 'tone' about his being there as there is with Ricardo Darín. The man's solemn appearance twinned with the general low-key immediacy to his being on screen is in no way an insult; on the contrary, for most of his work in terms of the characters he has played, a downcast and lonely-cut figure of an individual with some crucial decisions on his mind has seen him close to being always perfectly cast. His expression just seems sad, as if the weight of the world rests on his shoulders and there is nary a person within a hundred miles whom can help him deal with it – if we were in the film with him, we might see ourselves wanting to lend a hand. Here, that man is dropped into a film whose narrative is a weaving, twisting plot kicked off by a pretty harrowing catalyst and left to those primarily involved to stew in juices that do not involve a whole lot of justifiable help from the authorities whom operate distastefully. Here, Darín plays one of those protagonists placed on the front-line; a character who, at one point, has to literally kick away at a yapping, puppy-dog sized mutt in what you might categorise as self-defence but is an action born out of Darín's being in a place he initially should not have been. Not many protagonists in movies can kick a dog belonging to a somewhat elderly woman and still have the audience on their sides after a breaking and entering offense, even enforce a guffaw out of the whole situation: Darín can because we're on his side the moment we see him.",

190,18 October 2014,FilmCriticLalitRao,6, The secret in their eyes : A Juan José Campanella film with tremendous mass appeal as well as numerous loopholes.,"It is due to films made by veteran directors Fernando Solanas, Eliseo Subiela, Hector Alterio, Adolfo Aristarian, Maria Luis Bamberg etc that Argentine cinema continues to enjoy considerable fame among specialized film festival audiences and knowledgeable general public. In many ways, that tradition of success is being carried on by a group of young directors including Juan José Campanella whose films are quite popular in USA. However, 'The secret in their eyes' is a major disappointment as it ends up being a weak work of cinema with numerous plot related shortcomings. One glaring error is that Campanella's film does not concentrate on one particular theme. It flits amblingly from novel writing by a retired legal counselor to his desire to find love from his former lady boss and his willingness to learn more about a highly intelligent criminal who is believed to have perpetrated a heinous rape as well as murder. Apart from showcasing an important 'entertainment' content for viewers, director Campanella's film succeeds in depicting a certain equitable idea of justice with ""ethical implications"". This idea leads this film's protagonists to pursue 'justice' till the very end. Finally, things happen at such a frantic pace that viewers are left with no choice but to think highly about sixth Babylonian king Hammurabi and his famous adage ""an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth.",

The action takes place in two units of time, the 70s and the year 2000, but interest is almost entirely concentrated in the past.

The film has a unique sense of humor at the beginning which drags us into the movie. Fernando Blanco, the comedian plays an alcoholic with a lot of respect for friendship. Brilliantly scripted and directed by Juan José Campanella who has placed the twists perfectly and comes out of nowhere. And the cinematography by Felix Monti is scintillating particularly a sequence when investigators chase a suspect amidst a football match leaves us perplexed with ideas and creates the required tension.

The need of a closure is also for the hidden love for his former boss (soledad Villamil). With no doubt Campanella executes an interesting story with an accurate direction and cinematography. Performances are satisfying; nevertheless, the only one that greatly shines is Guillermo Francella - his character, Sandoval, is the only one that is lovable and touching in his pathetic.",

226,20 April 2011,shobhadeepthi,10, Life full Of Nothing,"""The Secret In Their Eyes"" is a Spanish movie and how did I end up watching this with subtitles? Well, I do not know how I land on these remarkable movies. Kudos to all the time that is spent on the internet. This movie is so poetic, touching, thought provoking, I only could imagine what emotions movie could have stirred up, if I had known Spanish language. May be that is why they say language is not a barrier for a perfect art. Performances are brilliant that many a times I did not have to read the subtitles. I could read their eyes and know what they are trying to say! Basic theme of this movie is passion. Everyone has a passion, that makes them live their life to the full, to the end. Passion is what keeps each of us going on. And this movie is a direct question in the face, to those who lead their life's without any passion, as invalids. How do people live empty life's? ""A guy can change anything. His face, his home, his family, his girlfriend, his religion,his God. But there's one thing he can't change. He can't change his passion"" Movie starts with Benjamin Esposito, retired from Criminal Court, working on his novel. His novel is a fiction based on his own life, and one murder case that he solved during his tenure, but to which he could not provide justice. Reason? Office politics. And this constantly troubles him all his life. For the purpose of his novel, he revisits the case and tries to trace the murderer and the husband of the deceased. He believes that doing so, will make him be at peace with himself. Movies goes back and forth in time, with flashbacks of his job at the Court, working with his friend Pablo Sandoval and lady boss Irene.",

'The secret in their eyes' proved to be one of the most poignant and masterfully crafted movies I have ever seen. The acting is nothing short of superb, and the depth of the characters, regardless of the barrier of language which an English-speaking audience may invariably experience, is wonderful. The film is profoundly captivating throughout, with a scattering of one or two truly comedic moments punctuating a piece of intense and shocking drama, which ultimately proves to be a tale of both extreme love and engulfing tradegy.",

The cinematography is top-notch, dousing everything in secretive shadows and dark earthy tones that suggest the past has more secrets than it is letting on. The acting depicts a strained anguish that expresses itself as a simmering rage against all the injustice around them. The storyline is fractured to let the viewer in on tiny bits of information at a time, much like the characters who have no clear grip on the circumstances controlling them. The football stadium scene is commendable for its masterful cinematography and narrative intensity, bringing closure to some of the plot but also opening Pandora's Box and opening up far more complications.",

Juan Jose Campanella may be an acclaimed director in his country, but his combination of murder mystery, romance and drama just wears thin being nothing more than ordinary. Although the film is artfully shot taking advantage of dazzling cinematography and set pieces, the story happens to be very conventional in its outcome. Besides, the narrative is far from gripping that is the result of subpar writing and unmemorable performances by actors. I was never particularly enthralled with the exception of two subsequent scenes. The first involves a superbly directed chase after a presumed murderer at the stadium, while the second showcases his hilarious interrogation in which his manhood is being questioned by a female investigator. These are the only sequences that really stand out in this overall boring movie that struggles to make any impression on you throughout its running time.

TSITE is, at best, a mediocre made-for-TV movie.

But technique never detracts from the action.

The soccer stadium scene and ensuing drama, and the ending, will effect me for years. There are so many parallels in this movie.

The truth is that it has everything you want, either for fun (with a certain humor that often sprinkle here and there , and the inherent suspense as the events will ocurre, never dropping from beginning to end) or to approach a seriously theme and truthful to some extent (and here play two things: the real drama of the matter of the main story and the passionate romance involving it in parallel), and more than expected also. Plus the fact that it contains excellent works on all levels, from the cast and speech to backstage and makeup, from the script and adaptation to audio and beautiful classical soundtrack, from photography to camera work.. Honestly, I can not point out anything negative. It's so catchy and touching in a way that 2h will seem like half, even less.

Benjamin is writing a novel about something that happened years back. There are professional and personal voids from that age which keeps dragging him in. He wants to solve the first one and craves, silently, for a solution to the latter. In this battle of his own, he needs to braver and smarter.

Whatever be said about the plot, the film is about the Argentinian soul, which is present in the fashion, in the serious furniture, in the limestone and wooden paneling of the buildings, in the pomp of the institutions, in the spicy dialogs, the flat and dry and cold landscape. No matter the background of poverty, corruption, abuse and economic decadence, one sees how the characters do not give up being elegant, vainly , proud, sarcastic, sexy, a little arrogant (sometimes trying to be European in South America) but very human. So far, it has a similar effect to ""el hijo de la novia"" by Juan Jose Campanella with Ricardo Darin and Hector Alterio, which includes the cuisine. And behind the Argentinian soul, with consistent roles played by excellent actors, Campanella makes up a great story of idealism, friendship, grief, wrath, love.",

At 129 mins it can get a little melodramatic and flabby at points, especially in the chaste romance between the legal beagles, but the setting and story outside of this is so engaging it hardly matters. The digitally-enhanced ""single shot"" football arena sequence is breathtakingly executed and Francella is remarkably well cast as the alcohol-sodden and hapless Sandoval. Quite marvellous.",

Despite the foreign-language Oscar, the expert performances and cinematography and whatnot, not to mention the glowing reviews on various websites (the Onion AV Club got it right with a B-, en mi humilde opinión), if you're the slightest bit tough-minded about plotting and plausibility (not to mention police procedures), I'd approach this one with caution.",

THe movie looks like it was made in the early and mid 90's although the story takes place in the 70's.

274,8 August 2011,batuhanyahya,8, Image is More Important Than Words,"Juan Jose Campanella's ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" was hailed as masterful piece of work instantly after it's release and many who saw the movie was mesmerized by it and i am one of those who able to see the movie rather late and it is really disappointing to see what i miss in that space of time between i heard about the movie and not watching it. first of all campanella's journey is a true one both the director and the screenwriter(Eduardo sancheri) have this sentimental understanding about the nature of the human kind so the emphasis on the ""eye"" subject that we see in the title of the movie is not just some coincidence it is actually a little hint about the core of the movie the filmmaker is not interested in the words or big statements what he's interested in is in fact the power of the image campanella shows us his intentions throughout the movie with wonderful camera use, little but effective dialog, magnificent pacing and editing and of course the performance he squeeze out from his actors and actresses... the movie starts with some truly memorable image actually the scene where the espotiso just starting to write his memoirs about the morales case and he recalls this beautiful, innocent and young girl, this is the mark of something that ends, seems to follow him, a cup of lemon tea and a sun beam that washes her cheek and campelena cut to esposito ripping of the page he just writes, with anger, and he starts over again but this sweet memory now turns into some sadistic rape scene and instantly he cuts back to esposito who ""now gently"" ripping off this page too... now this is maybe the best and simple example about the magnificent editing and directing about this film. there are lots of memorable scenes which audience feels time slips under his/her feets by simply playing with time forward and backward director creates uneasy yet acceptable atmosphere and leaves the audience to himself/herself, he/her has to understand the characters all by himself/herself and while we talking about the atmosphere of the film there are some important subjects that need to be told first the camera work is just amazing especially the stadium scene stands as a singular proof of that just how masterful that scene is... just remarkable... single plan shot from start to finish lasts about six minutes and it is really something any cinema fan should see some other director who tries do that would probably ruin it but campanella just handles it magnificently, i wasn't believe this to be true while i watch it i still find it hard to believe this to be done with so powerfully and of course another great effect on this atmosphere is no other than political background of the 70's Argentina the coup De et-at was taking place at the same time leftist movements were actively trying to overthrow the military government and this situation holds some key points in the development of the story but the director want to keep this at the background what he wants is to tell more humane story he don't want to preach politics but he criticize the military government and what it takes away from people of Argentina, as a strong political thriller enthusiast and as a person who lived in a country that resembles in many ways to the South American examples i wish campanella bring the political sub-plot to more attention which is an very important issue for all repressed countries but what he already does is really generous as what it is... the acting is another very solid department of the movie. the all three leads are really very fine delivering the goods. but the real winner is Guillermo Francella his playing is different, mature and yet childish portrayal of the Sandoval adds so many to film expends it's boundaries and also lets other characters to breathe as well really important figure in the script and rancella really understands even adds something more to his character. also Ricardo Darin, sole dad villa-mil, Pablo rago and Javier godino all play their parts successfully... and there is the script, at the beginning of the review i said it is a movie of the (haunting)images not the words or big talks and the script(delivered by sancheri and campanella) does exactly that and tones down the dialog it gives space both to actors and directors to really play out their roles. i am actually not against the ""full of words"" cinema of 60's(remember Lumet's theater adaptations in America, kitchen-sink influence in england) but as some important guys(like Hitchcock) said sometime ago a movie should not be about some talking images it has to move, ""go some place(literally)"" and this movie does that and this is important images stuck in your face just like vertigo's dreaming sequence now i have another images that haunts my mind and this is the real wonderful side of this film it stuck with you never let you go this is what cinema should do image should conquer yes there are many other films who could do that but this one takes it's subject with such a heartfelt passion it is something that came from inside i believe this movie is not just made for sake of a movie it wanted to tell us something that we don't want to see and do this with feeling just for that it deserves 10 points...",
275,5 December 2010,Vijay_grg,10, Eyes that spoke without saying,"My first movie review at IMDb and i couldn't ask for any better film than this. After i watched this film winning the Oscar in ""Best foreign language"" film category, I was very keenly waiting for its DVD to release here in U.S. 3 weeks ago I finally bought the DVD and immediately watched it. One word AMAZING!!! This is cinema at its best and sets the bar so high for the world of cinema. These kinds of movies are hard to come by. Its a gem. Its one of those films that slithers through your body and sinks in long afterwards. Everything is just nearly perfect, with the terrific casting led by Ricardo Darín and Soledad Villamil with strong supporting performance from Guillermo Francella (who is a delight to watch) also is a source for comic relief. Dialogue, screenplay,and cinematography are top notch. And one could only get tire of trying to find the synonyms for 'brilliance' to describe the direction of the film. Every word doesn't feel that it will do justice to describe the stunning direction of Juan José Campanella. He does an excellent job telling such a difficult story in such a flawless manner. Basically it is a love story with a detective mystery thriller twist to it.",
276,10 March 2022,mbrcf,7, Not as great as I remembered it to be,"Just like the notorious typewriter in this film, nearly all the major characters have a vital missing button and that missing button is to move on and let go of their obsession. Benjamin Esposito (the lead actor) is obsessed with the Liliana Morales homicide case, as her husband Ricardo is feverishly obsessed with finiding the culprit and ensuring his own version of proper justice. Likewise, Irene Hastings (the lead actress) can't make herself free from her unfulfilled love for Esposito, while Pablo Sandoval is unable to break the chains of heavy drinking.",

284,17 June 2010,shirleybluely,8, A Great Movie,"I must say that I felt bored at the beginning, partly because I didn't find a subtitle in Chinese, which made it difficult for me to catch the story. But I hanged on, and I'm glad I did so. This is truly a great movie. Every scene has its intention to express something, the typewriter with a broken key ""A"", Irene's door waiting to be closed, the photos been turned down in Benjamin's home. And love, Morale's love for his wife, making him waiting in the train station day after day only because the murderer MAY escape from there. The love lasts for more than 25 years and just this love encourages Benjamin to face his own feeling for Irene, for which she has been waiting for so many years.I knew little about that time in Argentina, the chaos of society, the judicial corruption, or some dark things like that, so I can't figure out what the director want to tell other than love. However, I'm still deeply touched only by the romance.",
285,9 May 2012,jcfv83,10, Justice. Friendship. Love. Hope,"Someone wrote: Basically a 2hr Argentinian Law and Order Episode. OK, this would be the best episode ever! It is a phenomenal thriller, with really unexpected twists. It will amaze you, I'm sure. On the technical side, it has all the Hollywood qualities. Why many foreign films have to have poor visual quality when using the same resources as many made ​​in Hollywood? The vison of Juan Jose Campanella is absolute in all aspects. Never pretentious. The movie must be exactly as he wanted, because is visually beautiful. But must of all, the soul of the movie are the characters, they really make you care. It gave me the feeling that in life, love can prevail, (even when you cross with a murderer) and that the world is full of good people: friends, family and couples. And it also deals with the moral question of taking justice on your on hands, when you see so much goodness threatened. The fear of failing to protect those you care, and how you can deal with that? What sacrifices are you willing to do? All of this comes in place when you are seeking the corage to do the right thing with the one you love. Is it better to keep your love in secret? A realistic drama/thriller but also with a realistic true-love story.",

287,22 May 2011,gilligan-11,8, Powerful exploration of human nature,"This 2010 Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film is one of the most powerful explorations of human nature to come along in the last few years. Through the story of Benjamin, a retired criminal investigator who has decided to write a novel about a murder case that has haunted him throughout his career, the director examines just what it means to hold on to one's passions, to maintain love and devotion in the midst of failure and loss, and to seek retribution. This film deftly weaves together a tale of mystery, political intrigue, unrequited love, and vengeance—all tempered with unexpected scenes of comic relief. Rarely are such epic themes explored so powerfully in such a small, personal story. Highly recommended.",

To commit a crime with passion, to take revenge with passion and to solve a case with passion. To create a story with passion, the characters need to be fed with passion. This film is indeed a passionate film to understand these characters and why they do what they do. However, this film lacks a certain punch. Suspense is to the point and it strikes the target finesse. This would have been a sure hit if it focused more on depth of the story. 8/10",

292,7 March 2021,barbicaned,4, What secret?,"12 years later I finally watched this movie, I'm argentinian and very suspicious about our cinema, I'm not going to mess with the ""murky"" state funding, but it's quality. Too arty, too pretentious, too criptic, too sui generis, too cinema school; this one although not suffering for much of that (maybe a little cinemtography pretention) has other issues that made me take six stars out.
Even as an argentinian and a porteño (citizen of Buenos Aires) I had to go back several times to understand what the characters said, bad sound is a trademark in argentine movies, I'm sorry, but it is (one star less).
Darín, Villarreal and Drago diction is another trouble, even though Darín´s here is better than in other films, sometimes it's really tiresome to try to understand what he's saying (2 stars less).
The yellowish shade through the whole movie, this may be a cinema school thing, it seems that they think common people need to see a film turned to some color (yellow, blue, sepia) to understad it's a movie (three stars less).
The lack of chemistry between Darín and Villarreal and the shallowness of their story was, though very present, very unrelatable (four stars less).
Drago´s acting was simply poor or misdirected, I couldn't feel his commitment to the role (five stars less).
And last, the entire plot is full of weaknesses; the twists in the main story are predictable to say the least (six stars less).",

294,9 July 2022,unholyprophet,9, An excellent story with a nice touch of argentinian humor and charm.,"The argentinian humor, the mistery, the romance, this movie has everything for an awesome movie night. My only complain is the slow take while finishing the third act and maybe a somewhat lucky resolution to a few plot points but none of them take anything from this excellent movie. The magnificent acting of Ricardo Darín and his chemistry with Guillermo Francella make it worthwhile.",
295,4 September 2016,leonel580,10, A real gem of our country,"Excellent movie, beyond everything you see, has a reality what was Argentina at that time. Darin's performance, sublime, as usual.

296,13 July 2021,abulfadlrami,9, Eye language,"If you are looking for a thrilling game changer plot twist in crime movie, this isn't your film. This film is about reading the eyes language. The Inspector sees something in the eyes of the raper captured in a photo with his victim. Similarly, His boss felt the audacity of rapers eyes steering at her cleavage despite the tension of being accused by murder and rape. That kind of movie women dig and resonate with. The tension between the inspectors and his boss is building up over years but he decided not to confront her and keep it formal as much as he can. In the finale, his eyes was full of courage, passion and love this time, so his boss asked to closed the door so that he don't can speak freely. The brilliance of the director and the actors was showing that messages through the eyes. The reason behind the gain of courage to admit his love was the husband of the raped murdered victim, whose eyes were a proof of the power of love on man and how he kept himself living by avenging his wife from the murderer.",
297,26 January 2017,marianajb,7, A pride of Latin American cinema,"A movie with flashbacks, love, crime, passion, drama, and mystery. That is just the perfect combination. First of all the cinematography is extraordinary, is different, and is risky; and the result is magical. Strating with the positions of the cameras, at some point of the scene they use an angle that is not very common, its original and I loved it. Ricardo Darín is an excellent actor, one of the best in Latin America. his performance in this movie was pretty good. Also Guillermo Francella performance was very very good. The whole screenplay is thrilling from beginning to end, and once it ends, you still wish for more. Is these kind of movies, is these kind of art that makes me proud to be a Latin American. Many people complain the language they use, but I think is wonderful because it adapts itself perfect to the film.",

306,9 September 2010,viennasold,6, Weaker than Oscar's competitor 'A prophet',"'The Secret in Their Eyes' is a decent movie. But nothing, except maybe the dialogs during the first half-hour of the movie, where Esposito acts hectic and where the friendship between him and Sandoval is nicely conveyed, nothing really stands out here - be it the plot, which might appear complex at times - simply because the scenario itself should have been tighter and, at the same time, more profound; be it the music, which is fairly cheesy and annoying; be it the acting, which is on shaky grounds (the best actor may well be supporting cast Guillermo Francella).
