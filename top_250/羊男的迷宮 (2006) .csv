0,8 January 2017,Hitchcoc,10, Stop the Abuse,"An incredibly creative piece of cinema. It incorporates an amazing fantasy world with the realities of war. It gives its protagonist a way of surviving and continuing on with a life after she could have lost everything. The visuality is striking, creating a world like we've never seen. There is an amazing use of computer generated images. Everything in this film is in balance as it shifts between fantasy and the horrors of the civil war under Franco. Del Torro is a director of the first order. If you don't like him, try to realize that he takes chances and there are always naysayers out there who want to tear down that creativity. Imagine Stravinsky stopping after ""The Rite of Spring"" because the Philistines who are stuck in the past couldn't give it its due or at least have some optimism.",/

6,4 February 2018,areatw,9, Wonderful combination of fantasy and reality,"Few would dispute that 'Pan's Labyrinth' is one of the best foreign language films of the 2000s, but I would go one step further and argue that it's also one of the best modern day fantasy/adventure films in general. There aren't many films that manage to blur the lines between fantasy and reality as effectively as 'Pan's Labyrinth'. The effortless transition between the real world and the underworld and the way the two worlds are interlinked really is something special and I've never seen it done as well before.",w
7,25 August 2006,dante_leebo,9," Beautiful, violent, magical and sad....","I was fortunate enough to catch Pan's Labyrinth last night as part of the 'Fright Fest' programme in London and was completely blown away. Guillermo Del Toro himself was present to both introduce the movie and to answer questions afterwards. He spoke very passionately about the film, and it was easy to see why. Guillermo Del Toro has created something very special - part war movie, part fantasy, that everyone should see. The film features a fantastic performance by Sergi Lopez as Captain Vidal and as central character Ofelia, newcomer Ivana Baquero delivers the performance of a seasoned veteran. If you are the type of person who is put off by subtitled movies, don't be. This is a very 'visual' film that does not rely overly on dialogue. This does not open until 24 November in the UK and 29 December in the USA but already I am looking forward to seeing it again (and buying the Special Edition DVD).This is the first time I've felt the need to write a review on here. Do yourselves a favour and go and watch it on the big screen.",/

10,21 January 2007,zetes,7," It's good, but nowhere near as good as the reviews would have you believe","I had unsurmountable expectations for this one, and, alas, they remain unsurmounted. It didn't even come close. It is an entertaining film, but, as a whole, it feels half-baked. Near the end of the Spanish Civil War, a little girl, Ofelia, is taken with her pregnant mother to an old mill, where her new husband, a sadistic army captain, awaits. At the mill, she meets a fairy who leads her to a faun, who asks her to perform three tasks so she might take her place as princess of a magical kingdom. It's less a fantasy film than a fairy tale. In that way, I suppose I'm obliged to forgive that its fantasy world goes completely unrealized and remains paper thin throughout. Honestly, except for a couple of sequences, there really isn't a fantasy world. Most of the film takes place in the real world, where the Captain is trying to rid the area of some pesky rebels and Ofelia's mother is struggling to survive her difficult pregnancy. What is much harder to forgive, though, is that Guillermo del Toro extends the two-dimensionality to the Spanish Civil War setting. The Captain is a completely cartoonish bad guy, and the situation is seen completely in black and white. I mean, we're talking about a real conflict here where many people died. It's kind of insulting. If this were an American made film, people would be railing against it. It's also insulting to Spirit of the Beehive, on which del Toro has said he based the film. Where Spirit is a gentle yet effective study on the nature of human cruelty, Pan celebrates human cruelty with extremely violent sequences which are meant to be enjoyed as they are in action films (the director did, of course, previously make Blade II and Hellboy). Wow, it sounds like I hated this film! I didn't, really. I have some ideological problems with it, obviously, and I wish it were better than it is. But it is an enjoyable little horror/fantasy film. You could do better, but you could do worse, too.",1
11,12 September 2006,allan-117,10, The best fantasy of the past decade,"Everyone's been raving about this. My opinion doesn't differ too much. It did however suffer slightly from the overwhelmingly high expectations I'd developed based on how brilliant everyone said it was, and the whole ""20min ovation at Cannes"" thing. Really, who stands for that long? That said, it's an amazing work.",4
12,19 May 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10, Quite possibly the best foreign language film I have ever seen!,"Don't let the fact that it is in Spanish throw you. This is a dark, moving and sometimes terrifying masterpiece of a film. Director Guilliemo Del Torro directs with briskness and deep understanding of the film. The film looks gorgeous, very beautiful in one scene, and quite Gothic in another. Another director I can think of that directs visually stunning films is Ridley Scott. The music score by Javier Navarette is haunting, poignant and beautiful. The script is very mysterious, suspenseful and genuinely moving at times, and there are some genuinely memorable characters, the idealistic protagonist, the brutal stepfather, the pregnant mother and the caring housemaid. Here is one of the few fantasies where the images stay with you forever. There are beautiful costumes and a stunning forest set, the labyrinth is very Gothic and dark, as is the wise and mysterious faun, and the war and torture scenes are unashamedly graphic. Another honourable mention should go to the monster that tricks children into eating his food when he is asleep, and then he wakes up and eats them. He was so terrifying, the very look of him, made my blood run cold. He is one of the most terrifying creatures I have ever seen in the history of film. All in all, a visually stunning and absolutely magnificent film, with a definite 10/10. Bethany Cox.",9
13,19 June 2006,luckyfay,9, A labyrinth you don't want to leave,"I saw this film toward the end of the Cannes Film Festival; it edged out all the others I'd seen, 30 of them, because of its wonderful story; history, politics and fantasy woven into a fabric spun by a superlative creative team headed by Guillermo del Toro. In comparison to this, his latest effort, del Toro's other films only hinted at the depth and breadth of his talent. In this film, much as I pride myself on foreseeing the outcome of most stories, I could not guess what would happen next. The film is quite long, yet suspense is sustained throughout. The music is some of the best I've heard in years, so well suited to the action that you almost don't notice its specific effect because of how well it is intertwined with the visual, emotional and intellectual experience.",7

15,26 May 2007,Galina_movie_fan,6, Entartaining but not one of the very best movies from last year,"When I heard first time about the movie made by the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro that was a mixture of many genres, including drama, fantasy, thriller, and fairy tale for adults that takes place in Spain of 1944 in two parallel words, one of unbearable bleak and horrifying reality, and the other of deliciously dark magic fantasy, I wanted very much to see it. I knew that the movie has been praised by many critics and has made hundreds top lists of last year, that it was nominated for countless awards including six Academy awards and it won three Oscars, and that it had received 20 minutes standing ovation at Cannes. The main reason for me was the fact that I love del Toro's earlier film, ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), the ultimate ghost story that goes beyond the genre and very successfully mixes horror, suspense, and coming of age during the war time story.",2

18,21 July 2016,ironhorse_iv,9, The door is locked. In that case. Create your own door. Open your mind and watch Pan's Labyrinth! It's an amazing movie. You just got to know where to look,"Director Guillermo Del Toro stated that he considers the story to be a parable to his earlier film, 2001's 'The Devil's Backbone', as both addresses similar themes. Set in Spain during the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) & influenced by children fairy tales from authors, L Frank Baum, Lewis Carroll, Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm, along with adult-driven fantasies novels from authors, Jorge Luis Borges, Arthur Machen, Lord Dunsany, & Algernon Blackwood. ""Pan's Labyrinth' tells the story of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a young girl who comes to believe she is the reincarnation of a princess from the kingdom of the underworld. However, her new stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi L√≥pez) thinks otherwise; who believes, that Ofelia is becoming too unstable for his plan for a stable Falangism regime for both his country and in his household. Without spoiling the movie, too much, there are two ways to look at this movie. One is looking at it through a child's mind where everything and anything is possible, regardless of circumstances. The other is through, an adult's mind, where rational thought dictates our actions. It's these two ways of thinking, that make the film, so thought provoking. Is Ofelia telling the truth and Vidal is the one, losing touch with reality or is Vidal right about the world, and everybody else is living in the fantasy world? Its complex questions like this that makes this fairy tale movie, so interesting to watch, but far too sophistical for small children. Definitely, it's not for toddlers or anybody under 8 year old, unless, you want them, to see something profoundly graphic/violent and disturbing. Not only that, it's somewhat depressing with a tear-jerker type ending. It's not family friendly, despite whatever, marketing wants you to think. Despite that, the film has really fine-adult-driven acting, mostly from both Ivana Baquero and Sergi L√≥pez. I have to say, Sergi for sure, as he's one of the best villains in modern day film history. The Spanish dialogue also well-written, even if it's a bit confusing at times. The English subtitles, was very helpful in trying to understand the story. The music by composter Javier Navarrete was very haunting & beautiful. The piano & violins really brings the sounds of our own mortality and purpose into question. Well-done. The film also has a supernatural horror tone to its fantasy sequences. While, the film employs some computer-generated imagery in its effect, it mostly use complex make-up and animatronic to bring its creatures to life. There is no greater example of that, then the characters of the Pale Man & the Faun, both played by the same actor, Doug Jones. One of the biggest misconception about this film is that the Faun is Greek-deity-Pan, when Del Toro, himself, stated out that he is not. Instead, he along with the Pale Man is both original characters, taken straight out of the legendary nightmares fuel of Greek, Japanese, Nordic, Christian and Roman mythology and mixed together into something new. Both creatures represented the goods & evils of authoritarian. First off, you got the Pale Man who represented man-made-control like fascism & communism. In a way, the juxtaposition of the Pale Man's table with the scene of frightened townspeople lining up to take the only food they could probably get, rations doled out by the Fascists or the Communism rebels, has some significance to the plot. If we are to believe, that the Ofelia makes this fantasy story, up, taken from multiple sources. Then, it's become very clear, that the Pale Man is supposed to represent the adults around her. After all, they are the one that trying to shatter Ofelia's trauma-triggered fantasy perception of her harsh reality. Like the Pale-Man eating children, they are the ones killing the youth within all of us, only allowing those mature enough to breed and survive. It's control 'survival of the fittest' at its scariest. A very strong Holocaust overtone. Then you got the Faun that represented phenomena or the laws of nature. Just as much, as we have to follow man-made authoritarians; we're also dictated by the harsh changing environment in which, we lived in; which we mostly have no control of. Yet, we try to be disobedience against it. We always trying to control death and childbirth. It's no surprised that Del Toro chose the character's look to invoke a certain 'light-bringer'. Like mandrake roots, free choice in small amounts us to have some control of our lives, but in larger doses might kill us. Being submissive to something out of your control is not a bad thing. The existence of the unexplained, ever make this, belief, somewhat stronger. Overall: Regards to whether or not the fantasy underworld was real or a product of Ofelia's imagination, it doesn't really matter, as long, as you get that message. However, I didn't like, how Del Toro kinda ruin it, by spoiling his answer. In my opinion, having a film so deliberately ambiguous, is a stroke of genius. It's better off that way. In the end, it's a must watch from me. Highly recommended.",?

22,12 October 2006,davidcapa,10, Innocence and brutality,"I saw the movie yesterday in the Spanish premiere and I confirm: it's one of the best Guillermo del Toro's films (if not the best ever). Innocence and brutality, fantasy and reality, together in a wonderful fairy tale about the power of magic in dark times. The performances are great, mainly from Sergi L√≥pez, Maribel Verd√∫ and the big revelation of the film: the 12 years girl Ivana Baquero. Del Toro repeats the context of the film ""El Espinazo del Diablo"" (""The Devil's Backbone""), the Spanish Post-Civil War, with the same philosophy: the supernatural invading the daily life in a depressive environment and the innocence of children trapped between both world. But ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is most compact, most mature and best done in very aspects, and perhaps it's the most personal movie from Del Toro.",_

30,2 June 2007,moonspinner55,5," Beautiful production, underwhelming story...","In 1944 Spain, as the Spanish Resistance is losing to the Fascist army, a pre-teen bookworm named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother come to stay with the girl's new stepfather, an icy army captain. While stopping for a break on their initial journey, the youngster fits the missing piece of a statue into its proper place; this unleashes a magical winged creature who leads the girl to the pale faun, a gargoyle-like guru who helps Ofelia understand she possesses the spirit of the Princess Moanna and will live eternal...that is, until she completes three heady tasks before the next full moon! Spanish-language fantasy begins well, combining elements of Grimm and 'Alice in Wonderland' with the modern, grotesque look of a Bj√∂rk music video, but the elements of the story are hazy rather than coherent (if Ofelia hadn't put back the missing piece, would she still have Moanna's spirit?). Baquero is sublime as the child, but every segue from her to the evil captain halts the movie's momentum, and the incidentals (the captain's party, Ofelia ruining her new dress, the assistant sneaking medicine) aren't compelling. A film which bides its time between an incredible fantasy world and the harsh realities of the day is ultimately going to come up short (we can't wait for the preliminaries to be over with so that the real story can progress); despite a smoothly efficient direction and an able cast, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" simply feels too slight, too undemanding to garner status as a fantasy-classic. ** from ****",

The cinematography is quite impressive and del Toro displays a fine visual flair. However, the script is too random and contrived to be interesting and the characters are one-dimensional. The captain, for example, is pure evil, lacking a single redeeming character; his wife is a whiny weakling.

One is a tale of life and rebellion in 1944 Spain under the Franco regime, the other tale involves a magical world in which the faun, Pan, oversees three tests that will allow Ofelia to claim her rightful place as princess in that magical world. At the beginning of the film both tales have little in common with one another other than the girl being at the center of each.

If you are hesitant due to the subtitles and native Spanish of the film, don't be.

Now, more than 10 years later, Guillermo Del Toro finally has created what many (himself included) call ""his masterpiece"", and to the surprise of many, they are not wrong. ""El Laberinto Del Fauno"", Del Toro's 6th movie, is truly a wonderful film deeply rooted in the director's favorite genres: horror and fantasy. A modern fairytale, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is a remarkable achievement that probably, is just the beginning of a new stage in this courageous and imaginative director.",

Ofelia is step-daughter to a sadistic captain of the guards of an area of Franco's Spain still under guerrilla threat of the residual partisan opposition.

The film is largely a standard wartime drama, and the brutality of the Franco regime is shown repeatedly just in case you don't get it the first dozen times.

49,19 November 2006,fabulousrice,8, The Labyrinth of Del Toro,"Guillermo Del Toro shows an incredible amount of passion for his job. In interviews, in festivals, it is undeniable that this man adores making films, from one end of the creative process to another, and has tremendous energy and honesty for the activity. Nevertheless, there is something that doesn't function in his films, and as heartbreaking as it is to see someone with ideas and talent fail, this film isn't an exception and has a few weak points as well as his other ones. For some reasons explained further, it isn't even a ""true"" fantasy film. I have to stress upon how wonderful and magnificent the imagery - not just of this film but of all his films - is. Man-like creatures, caves, labyrinths, statues, puzzles, everything that contributed over the years to make Del Toro's imagery makes him a very powerful visual director, which times like these are in desperate lack of. The visions he projects onto the screen make him no less than a visionary. The thing that fails to give his film(s) the grandeur they need, though, seems to be always the same element: character depth / psychological analysis of his characters / the way the characters and their personalities blend into the rest of the film. Maybe we can attribute it to Del Toro having more patience to polish the sequences with special effects than the ones with actors, but in particular in this film, the characters seem to have no depth at all, they are grounded to feel one emotion at a time. Ofelia in the film is shown owning and reading books, but her relation to these books, what they mean to her, what they bring her, this relation is never shown or explained, we have to go by a stereotype and ""assume"" for ourselves that she has a wild imagination. The mother of Ofelia is also a faulty character of the story, we the audience have to fill a gap, and imagine for ourselves why shy would be attracted by Vidal, what brings her to be forced to stay with a monster like Vidal as opposed to remaining a single mother, etc... Vidal himself is very quickly presented: we know his lineage was military and that his father let him have his watch... not much of an emotional background for a man who tortures and kills with no hesitation! We know nothing of Vidal as a child, we only have this one-dimension, Manichean character. The list goes on, and none of the characters - Mercedes and Pablo, the doctor, etc, are presented or explained to the viewer. The same could be said about the elements of the illusory world. Usually, though, fantasy/horror films don't need any explanations (see Edward Scissorhands, Alien, Legend...), but this one would need to have some, and this is probably due to the state of psychological confusion of the characters (or, should I say, their irrationality). Ofelia, throughout the film, seems to live in constant fear of the tyrant Vidal, yet finds enough time and solace to go on imaginary journeys at night, and light-heartedly do anything the faun asks her, without even questioning or wondering where it will lead her. Mercedes, when given the opportunity to gut Vidal and be finished with him, leaves him alive half-way. And the doctor itself, whose side on the events is never clear, never poisons Vidal or puts himself in the way when given opportunities. Is Guillermo Del Toro cold? We might wonder. He has absolutely no scruples when he tries to shock the audience with violence towards nice characters, with monsters, with blood. Yet when his overall goal is to make a fantasy film, he remains a little bit too polite and shy to really break into the genre. To me, a ""real"" fantasy film would have had the imaginary break in the ""reality"". Yet Vidal doesn't see the faun, the faun doesn't save anyone or scares Vidal. Reality remains reality and fantasy remains inside the heads. The imaginary world in itself seemed a bit poor because of that, because of the film not really being a fantasy film, keeping the fantasy inside the head of its protagonist and reducing the spectrum of illusions (which are never directly opposed to the ""realist"" world). Overall, the film shows great academicism, not just by politely keeping the imaginary and the reality separated, but also by the decisions of the film-makers (the editing is gentle when it should be a bit punchier, the camera moves are scarce, the music is incredibly lame and boring, the camera angles are overall inexistent, etc).",
50,5 January 2007,Quinoa1984,10, One of the best fairy tales for adults I've ever seen,"Guillermo Del-Toro goes into full bloom with a real feat of cinematic strength with Pan's Labyrinth, the kind of film that builds more and more with momentum until one's left in a total engrossment in the storytelling and the fates of the characters (mainly the little girl of the story, Ivana Baquero's Ofelia). Del-Toro knows that since his movie is mainly more for adults than the kids (I wouldn't not recommend it to kids, but the younger ones would definitely get freaked out by the more gruesomely violent moments), it should really be provocative by way of showing how a child has no other choice but to go into the realm of one's fantasies. But on further introspection about the movie, what makes it even more fascinating is how, in a strange way, it's not escapism in the sense that the girl retreats to the dreamworld. If anything the dreamworld retreats to her, or rather each side of fantasy and reality have an equal pertinence here, unlike another film from this past year, the (underlooked) Terry Gilliam film Tideland, where a little girl also had to escape under no other recourse to which it transformed her own world-view to a great degree. Pan's Labyrinth blends together a unique form of magical realism that grows more potent and aborbing on a repeat viewing, and it's actually stronger by showing how the fantastical can be contrasted with what's really terrifying and cruel in the world.",

El Laberinto Del Fauno only misses out on being the best film of 2006 because Zwartboek took so awfully long to enter production, but its virtues exceed its faults by such a long way that it will always be a benchmark in storytelling. When I say it is based to a great degree on ancient fairy tales such as those written by the Grimm Brothers, it would be all too easy to mistake El Laberinto Del Fauno for being aimed at children. And that would be selling it oh so very short. Like all of the fairy tales that have been bastardised into something puerile by Disney, El Laberinto Del Fauno is a story that every adult should learn from. Children will be frightened and saddened by it, but intelligent or hyperlexic children (or both, such as I was), will get far more out of it than the G-rated tosh that they seem to expect intelligent children to enjoy nowadays.",

If Del Toro wanted to make Capitan Vidal really terrifying, he would have made a little bit more sympathetic at times, like ""Landa"" in Inglourious Basterds - probably the most terrifying nazi ever on the silver screen. Vidal could at least have been a little bit concerned for his wife when she was bearing his unborn son. But now, he is a facha macho, so he can not show emotions at any time. Even the symbolism of the labyrinth is too easy : especially the end, where the self sacrifice of Ofelia is a clear sign of a Messias, including the invitation to sit at the right hand of her father in a sort of a pagan Trinity (with her mother).

What an imaginative spectacle Del Toro has created here, a pure delight on every conceivable spectrum. A young girl, Ophelia, is sent to a mountain army station with her pregnant mother, in order for her sibling to born in the presence of the her stepfather, the Captain. The environment is hostile, but the sides are drawn clear early on in the film, and an even side story between guerrillas and their opposition give the film a realism that juxtaposes with the movie's terrific fairy tale premise. Shortly there after, Ophelia discovers a fairy and is soon led to a labyrinth on the army stations outskirts. Her arrival in the maze is something of prophecy, and once she delves deeper in, the best part of the movie begins. Great visuals and equal acting highlight the film from start to fin. And though a couple parts seem to be rushed for the sake of time, Del Toro directs effortlessly, mixing realism with fiction sublimely.

Nevertheless I could happily have watched a version of this film if it had no fantasy elements and at least had a cathartic experience based on the bad guy getting what he deserved. But the fantasy elements just did not fit here. Firstly they were strictly fantasy 101 - oh, the girl goes on the hero's journey represented by the journey into the underworld where she has to perform a series of tasks to prove her worth. Secondly they had no relationship to the real world events. Thirdly as the message was presumably that she escaped from the real horrors by fantasising, then why bother with the complex symbolism? If you want fantasy then ""Lord of the Rings"" does better than this at portraying the horrors of war. If you want the real horrors of war then there are a zillion things you could watch, staring with Apocalypse Now and working down from there. I'm a big fan of fantasy and I'm a big fan of realism but this attempted combination just does not work on either count. This film will appeal to those who fancy themselves as intellectuals and like reading magical realist novels that win literary prizes. I would think that most fantasy fans, who can discern the subtext of a story in a heartbeat, and most of those who are moved by a war film can only be baffled by the praise heaped upon this entirely pedestrian film that tries to succeed by bludgeoning the viewer with the obvious.

87,18 July 2011,toast-15,1, slasher horror flick masquerading as epic fantasy,"**contains spoilers** Have you ever had a miserably bad experience at a restaurant that you previously had thought would be stellar because of all the good reviews? This movie is that restaurant. It's all hype but the king has no clothes, though few would admit it. What it really is is a badly done horror movie hiding behind the facade of a fantasy wrapped in a war movie. What better ploy to show gobs of blood and gore? This movie is a blood fest and the only love the director shows for any of his characters, is the loving embrace by the camera every time blood is in the scene. Someone is stitching his own mouth: Close-up please! Someone is being beaten about the head: Close-up please! Someone is being tortured: Close-up please! Someone needs an amputation: Close-up please! It was so ridiculous that I almost expected to see ""Blood"" make an appearance in the screen credits. You know you're watching a bad movie when every single major character takes actions that are completely out of character and it doesn't take long to figure out that the reason for such is that you are being rather obviously manipulated because the director has another blood fest to embrace in the next scene. Incidents don't occur to advance the plot, they occur to advance the gore. In one scene the rebels actually start a campfire in midday in clear view of the enemy base camp. At first you think that no rebel army could be so stupid and that it is probably a trap. Well, think again. There is no trap; they actually did start a fire in the middle of the day for no other apparent reason other than, one presumes, to warm their lunch! The rebel army is composed of morons who leave astonishingly stupid clues behind so that key benefactors can later be implicated and/or murdered (in gory close-up, of course). The rebels have a spy at the enemy base camp but do you think the spy would take the opportunity to poison the enemy leader? No, of course not. Instead, the spy uses her plumb position to act as postal carrier! When she actually does have a prime opportunity to kill the enemy leader, she instead squanders it by simply cutting his mouth open. (How else could you have the self-stitching close-ups later on?) She then leaves and walks right past the very people who apprehended her in the first place. Did she honestly think she wouldn't get caught walking in plain view of them? The stupidity of the characters in this movie is mind boggling. This isn't Hitchcockian suspense, it's more like B movie schlock fest alerts; every time someone does something stupid, you know blood will follow. The stupidity isn't what you would expect from characters in a real first rate movie. However, the stupidity is exactly what you would expect in a movie like Freddie vs. Jason or some such teen slasher movie. And that's really all that this is; it's a slasher masquerading as a fantasy wrapped in a war movie. After all, you have to at least pretend to have some semblance of a plot. When someone finally does decide to poison the enemy leader, he occasionally stumbles but otherwise, the lethal dose has little impact; exactly what one would expect from the hard-to-kill ""Jason"" type character typical of most slasher movies. But what I found most offensive of all was the death scene where the little girl is by herself with the spy a few steps away, not even comforting/hugging her but instead humming a wordless ""lullaby"" that sounds more like a depressing and wordless funeral dirge. Aberrant and abhorrent.",

The scariest thing in the whole movie, though, is a man trying to live up to a legacy of violence. Seeing someone's face get bashed in by the villain for absolutely no reason tells us all we need to know about who the real monsters are. This is a great use of characterization, and in the first act, nonetheless. This is a beautiful movie with extreme violence and sad themes about war and power, but still beautiful.",

90,21 January 2007,howard.schumann,8, A personal film about memory,"Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth has been called a fairy tale, but it is one without the color, warmth, or wonder we normally associate with films of this type. Rather, it owes more to the Latin genre of magic realism, as it reflects the grim fantasies of a young child caught in the middle of a brutal conflict and her desperate longing for a world without pain. Set in Spain after Franco had emerged victorious in the Spanish Civil War, Nationalist troops and die hard resistance fighters continue the struggle in the Spanish countryside. As the film opens, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) and her daughter Ofelia, brilliantly performed by Ivana Baquero, are traveling to join Carmen's new husband, Falangist Captain Vidal (Sergei Lopez) in his military headquarters.",

And yet this film is rated at #41 on the IMDb Top 250 film list--higher than ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""Alien,"" and even ""The Wizard of Oz""!

98,6 April 2007,Coventry,8, One of a Kind Fantasy film. Definitely Del Toro's greatest film!,"Even though I'm one of the absolute few horror freaks out there who thinks the films of Guillermo Del Toro are vastly overrated (or at least over-hyped), deep down I was somewhat confident that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" would rapidly become his ultimate masterwork. All of his previous genre efforts contain ingenious fantasy elements and genuinely macabre undertones (especially ""Cronos"" and ""The Devil's Backbone"") but the screenplays always were unexciting - on the verge of dull, even - and eventually only depended on Del Toro's directorial style & craftsmanship. The aforementioned titles, and to a certain degree ""Blade II"" and ""Mimic"" as well, are enchanting to look at but the stories ultimately failed to impress me. A simple glimpse at the poster art and synopsis of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" already indicated it would be a world of difference! It seems as if Del Toro single-handedly revives the formula of legitimate fairy-tales and passionately reverts to all its old-fashioned and uncanny characteristics, like ominous & grotesque landscapes, youthful heroines, monsters and fairies, violence and very disturbing scenery. Tim Burton is another very gifted filmmaker in the field of adult fairy-tales, but even his films eventually tend to get sentimental and overly joyful, whereas ""Pan's Labyrinth"" admirably sustains a dark and harrowing atmosphere throughout. And it becomes even more praiseworthy, because Del Toro also managed to successfully blend the fantasy-atmosphere with actual black pages in our history books; more particularly the fascist political situation in Spain near the end of WWII. The film opens with an introduction of a young princess who lost her immortality because she got curious and left her father's magical kingdom in order to explore the rest of the world. Her spirit still floats around though, eagerly looking out to get into the body of a young girl who's courageous and strong enough to fulfill three ordeals that'll bring her back to her father. The fantastic dreamy tone of the intro brutally gets interrupted with images of a young girl and her pregnant mother traveling to the domain of her stepfather, who's an incredibly relentless, sadistic and power-mad army captain under the reign of Franco. Whilst Ofelia enters the garden's labyrinth, where Pan the guardian informs here about her birthright, rebels and insiders fruitlessly attempt to bring down the Captain's dictatorship. Even though ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a constantly eventful motion picture, it has to be said the opening 45 minutes (after the intro) are rather dull and disappointing. Ofelia's initial meetings with Pan as well as her first task to accomplish aren't convincing and lack the dark atmosphere the brief fairy-tale introduction promised us. Only after Ofelia's second ordeal ¬ñ a brief but wondrous confrontation with a malevolent creature with eyes in the palms of his hands ¬ñ and a baffling depiction of the Captain's evil persona (that man is totally emotion- and heartless!), the film becomes indescribably compelling and hauntingly unsettling. And particularly the climax, which features some unexpected and rarely-seen-before twists, is a powerful demonstration of versatile cinema. The cinematography, set pieces and wholesome of effects all look stunningly breathtaking and nobody can every claim the Oscars ""Pan's Labyrinth"" won in these categories are undeserved. It's a magnificent film to look at AND listen to as well, as the music (courtesy of Javier Navarette) is extremely enchanting. Watch it when you have the opportunity!",

115,7 September 2017,Screen_Blitz,9," Guillermo Del Toro crafts an exuberant, yet nightmarish fantasy world, blending high-classed visuals with and storytelling with sobering history on the European front","Picture an adult version of 'Alice in Wonderland', add graphic violence and momentous themes to the mix, and you got yourself an accurate picture of Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth (or El Laberinto del Fauno in Spanish). This film takes a high-classed fantasy genre and spins into a dark, twisted universe where fairy tales clash with the grim history of the European front during World War II. The results that transpire is an Alice in Wonderland-like adventure that strikes at the heart not with whimsical excitement or charm, but with its wicked twists and turns that captures the innocence of childhood diminished under the unforgiving history that defined our world today. Do not let the visuals fool you, this is by no means a kid-friendly adventure. It is very dark, very violent, and proceeds a sense of dread from beginning to end; and Del Toro has almost no doses of levity to offer in the bargain. On the upside, the scarcity of child-friendly themes is what makes this high-classed fantasy tale so unique. The film is set in 1944 during the Spanish Civil War when Spain was being overrun by fascism. Following the death of her father who was killed in the war, 11-year old Ofelia (played by Ivana Baquero), a fairy tale obsessed youngster, moves with her mother (played by Ariadna Gil), who is growing ill from her pregnancy, to the country side of Spain to escape the chaos. There, she meets her new stepfather Captain Vidal (played by Sergi Lopez), a fascist army officer with a sadistic edge, and Vidal's housekeeper Mercedes (played by Meribel Verdu) who she grows a close bond with. On night, Ofelia is awoken by a fairy who leads her to a mysterious labyrinth where she meets a giant faun (voiced by Doug Jones). Upon meeting, she learns she is the princess of a magical kingdom, but must prove her loyalty by completing three unpleasant tasks before the full moon rises. As the war atrocities rage on and the lines between reality and fantasy begin to dissolve, Ofelia is pitted in a ruthless battle that threatens to tear both her and her family apart. ",

It is all in the Spanish language, so you will find no Hollywood actors in the cast here. Even with the Hellboy duology in his body of work, this is probably still the most known work by writer and director Guillermo del Toro, unless you count his writing credit for the Hobbit movie. Anyway, this one we have here runs for slightly under two hours including credits and it is a mix of fantasy movie and politics movie. It is set in Spain in the year 1944, so times were tumultuous, even if there is no real focus on the current global or European political climate from that time outside Spain. But that is perfectly fine. There are probably a 100 well-known films (from abroad) out there about the consequences and direct effects of World War II in Germany and probably another 1,000 that are not so well-known, so it is perfectly fine for once to have one that focuses on another country that we virtually know nothing about from films what the situation was like.",

Del Toro opted to construct both an under-developed war movie and an under-developed fantasy tale, resolving each with transparent cop-outs and plugging holes along the way with murder.

First, let me set some guidelines. This is a great movie. It was made with a lot of skill and talent, it is a different approach to story telling and there is a lot to be admired. However, one thing that I simply cannot stand anymore is how exponentially increasing masses of people keep calling this ""one of the best fantasy's ever"", ""a dark and horrific, yet wonderfully creative trip down the rabbit hole"". People, if this is one of the best fantasy's ever, or even of recent times, then all that means is our expectations of what a fantasy should be are sorely lacking. Throughout the entire movie, there are two, count them, TWO scenes that are pure fantasy, and neither one lasts more than perhaps four minutes. The rest of the fantasy takes place in real life situations with subtle hints of fantasy or one or two fantasy characters appearing to talk to the girl. Again, don't jump down my throat too quickly, these scenes are interesting to watch and for light touches of fantasy I think it was very well done, but by no means whatsoever can a movie that is 75% war drama and 25% fantasy, if that, be considered an ""enchanting and mysterious fairy tale"". If anything, it is a dark war drama with innovative and well crafted flairs of fantasy interwoven, but stop reviewing this movie in ways that are going to mislead people into thinking they are going to see a flood of creative and magical imagery!",

The title of this movie should have been ""Spanish Torture"" or ""The Captain's an A-hole!"" I realize that the setting is WWII Spain and therefore the on-going horrors are not nice, but HOW LONG really does the movie need to bang us over the head with this concept??! The audience quickly learns that the Captain is a total heartless douchebag, so there's no need to keep proving it! But endlessly, they do. He kills, tortures, turns just about everyone around him into pulps of blood! They never spend enough time on this fantasy-land the small girl escapes to. For every two minutes of Labyrinth time, you get to suffer through yet another 25 minutes of the Captain's brutality! The violence/gore was persistent. Being a person who does NOT like blood and gore, this movie proved too much for my senses, much too graphic. Constantly, I was hiding my face from said gruesomeness. Every time they showed the Captain, I became nervous over what cruelty he would do next! Also this fantasy-land is not believable as something this girl would escape too. The creatures there were much too scary. A barfing frog, a monster that eats fairies head first, and the demonic faun are just too much! Do everyone you know a favor and DO NOT recommend this awful bloody mess to anyone! Save your time and money.",

144,22 October 2006,annoman,10," Upon seeing a motion-picture such as this, viewers can hardly help but to surrender under the overwhelming weight of elation that results from its liberating creativity.","Bravo Guillermo! From the brilliantly perturbed visionary who shared his eerily morose tale of abhorrent warfare and infringed adolescent innocence in 'The Devil's Backbone,' comes the gorgeously sadistic fantasy, 'Pan's Labyrinth.' As quality fantasies seem to do, Del Toro's elegantly haunting 'Labyrinth' infiltrates the mind by way of its intrigue's fantastic visions; in this case, he does so with an alarming tale of Spanish tyranny, disquieting violence and superfluous gore. Not since the likes of Argento's 'Deep Red' and 'Suspiria' has carnage been so immeasurably beautiful. This poignant saga shadows the dreamy adventures of Ofelia, an imaginative young girl who creates the fanciful world of 'Pan's Labyrinth,' in which remarkable creatures of various sorts dwell. As the repressed nation of Spain witnesses its peak in post-war violence, Ofelia's adoptive father is given the responsibility of eradicating any rebellious alliances from the vicinity. While he and his wife struggle with the troublesome happenings outside their home, Ofelia escapes to her favorite place; one rich with wondrous landscapes and unknown fortune. 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a film of exceptionally rare caliber. Upon seeing a motion-picture such as this, viewers can hardly help but to surrender under the overwhelming weight of elation that results from its liberating creativity. Del Toro's 'Pan's' could very well be this year's 'Fellowship of the Ring,' snagging Oscar nods in the departments of makeup, costume design, set decoration, sound, editing, and art direction; heck, maybe it'll even win a few.",

At first glance a lot of people thought that Pan's Labyrinth was a children's film that looked like something that resembled Alice In Wonderland. Firstly people could not be more wrong, Pan's Labyrinth is a gruelling, disturbing, emotional and brutal journey of light and dark.

151,27 March 2020,jayjaycee,10, What exactly is the nightmare?,"""El Laberinto Del Fauno (Pan's Labyrinth)"" is a 2006 Spanish fantasy drama directed by Guillermo Del Toro starring Ivana Baquero and Sergi Lopez. After the recent watch of ""A Monster Calls"" I thought it was time to rewatch one of the film's most obvious influences. What makes this watch so special is the simple fact that I experienced it in the original Spanish version, of course with subtitles. Cause you know, I don't speak Spanish at all, but I wanted to see it as original as possible.
In the past, a trio of Mexican directors have established themselves in modern Hollywood and are jokingly known as the ""Mexican Trinity"" nowadays. Those directors are Alfonso Cuaron, Alejandro G. Innaritu and Guillermo Del Toro, all three are not only Academy Award winners, they also managed to make successful films in both English and their own mother language. In the case of Del Toro, his hugest success is this fantastic fantasy drama. As initially stated, I've already seen it roughly two years ago and it already amazed me back then. Now upon a rewatch, I see myself appreciating it even more. The director has put all blood, sweat and tears into this project and it's palpable in every single minute of runtime. He's created a nightmarish fairy tale that consists of countless small facets that make it so incredibly outstanding. What probably makes this film so legendary is simply how it looks. From start to finish it's absolutely picturesque and colorful, the visuals are nothing but stunning. On top of that, it doesn't only look incredible, it's at the same time ingeniously captured. DP Navarro did his best work in here and is one of the main reasons the film works out so well. But it's not only the superb style, it's also the story that makes it so uniquely precious. The Mexican mastermind has written and enacted a compelling and perfectly paced dark coming of age tale of a young girl during the Spanish war. In the course of this, he doesn't only manage to create realistic characters with complex personalities, he also succeeds to draw on a number of genres without letting it become a mess. What this film combines is nothing short of masterclass writing. On the core it's a packing history drama that elegantly weavers to together itself with fantasy and horror elements. Fairies and Fauns in a war drama? So strangely experimental. The Pale Man? Absolutely horrifying and iconic. As if that wasn't enough, the film even offers subtle social criticism with a juxtaposition of the war infected reality with the terrifying fantasy world, but it obviously comes to the conclusion that the reality is the true horror in this. While the CGI isn't quite the most outstanding (come on, it's no Hollywood blockbuster!), it still offers shockingly brutal make up effects that underline this statement. All in all, this film is hands down one of the most masterfully crafted feature films of all time. Not only does it have a breathtakingly beautiful story, it also has excellent acting performances a captivating plot and eerie visuals. It's a unique piece of art that combines countless aspects to sheer brilliance. Its overall tone end especially the ending might be sad, but it's never too depressing. The film effortlessly manages to hit you at the whole range of human emotions. Every director has a masterpiece and this is without a doubt Del Toro's magnum opus and probably one of the best Spanish films of all time. An absolutely beautiful dark fairy tale that anyone should have seen at least once.",

The fact that Captain Vidal has absolutely no positive qualities is utterly ridiculous since no one is that sadistic and terrible (even Anton Chigurh showed signs of sympathy) and made the more realistic parts of the story seem that much more unbelievable.

A simple tale and a simple vision of escaping from a desperate reality. We have the extreme visually graphic brutality of the general against many softer feminine elements (and virtuous feminine strength shown over and over again). So, good versus evil?

Gripes aside, this is still a worthy fantasy with elements of Clive Barker's ""Nightbreed"", ""Hellraiser"", and Jim Henson's ""The Storyteller"". The resolution, in which the fantasy elements and the bloody reality meet, fails to reconcile these polar opposites and the result is incongruity.

One analysis I've read suggested that Ophelia, by clinging to her books and fantasy world represents a need or appreciation for stories, which is ""human,"" and that the dad is ""inhuman"" because he only cares about routines, procedures, and the passing of time.

Be forewarned that this movie is not for the faint-hearted, as it contains some of the most grisly images I have seen on screen. However, they are truly essential to the story that del Toro unfolds with emotional precision since they reflect and echo the brutalizing violence during that time when Franco's armies were still eliminating what was left of the Republican rebels in hiding five years after the war's end.",

From Cronos to The Devils Backbone to Blade 2 and more recently Hellboy, Del Toro has invited the viewer into his world of machinery and monsters. No more so than Pan's Labyrinth (more literally The Labyrinth of the Faun) in which he creates some of the most tantalisingly sumptuous images he's put to celluloid so far. In post Civil War Spain, 1944, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her mother Carmen go to live with her sadistic stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). While there she meets The Faun (Doug Jones) who tells her that she may be a lost Princess and she must complete several tasks in order to prove her identity.

193,15 January 2007,IRateFilms,10, Pan's Labyrinth Review,"Pan's Labyrinth is a fairy tale story for adults that centers on a young girls escape from reality, that reality being fascism in civil war-torn Spain circa 1944. Guillermo Del Toro's newest picture brings us adults back to the place fantasies like The Never Ending Story did when we were children. The sheer darkness and violence of the fantasy segments perfectly complement the blood and torture portrayed during the war scenes. Ofelia, not being able to grasp what is going on around her, escapes into a world of faun's and fairies which at times are scarier than the real villain of the film, Captain Vidal played with by venerated Spanish actor Sergi Lopez. The real praise, when it comes to performance, must be handed to Maribel Verdu who's fear and inspiration for freedom are truly envisioned through her eyes. Del Toro does use many transitions in the film that lend to a one-shot impression, by using trees and walls to cut from one angle to another, something Hitchcock used to make Rope look like one unbroken shot. These transitions lend greatly to the stories two parallel universes, making them equally real to me as the two came closer and closer to intersecting. Ofelia's world of imagination is filled with over-sized frogs, bugs and various creatures made from the earth, that crawl in and out of the film seamlessly, complementing the editing.",

While I do believe great movies affect our psyches, I believe it is the responsibility of filmmakers to not betray our trust: this movie drags our innocence through the mud. The GRAPHIC VIOLENCE was unbearable. If you are not at all sensitive to violence, you may feel just a bit queasy when the face of a man is slit open. If you are sensitive to violence, please do not see this movie, not even on DVD. I feel sick and I am angry that the film did not merit some sort of X rating for violent content. Del Toro: you may have had reason to stun us, but at what expense? The reason violence is unwanted is because it's horrible, and to show the most violent things I have ever seen on film without warning (the opening stunner of the bottle through the face - IN your face) is betrayal.

200,10 February 2007,cultfilmfan,8, Pan's Labyrinth,"Pan's Labyrinth is a Mexican film in Spanish with English subtitles. The film is set in the 1940's in Spain and is about a young girl named Ofelia who comes with her mother to live with her evil stepfather who is an army general during the end of World War 2. To escape the sadness and evil around her, Ofelia discovers a labyrinth in the back of the house and meets a creature who resembles a faun who tells her that she is a princess and must complete several tasks to come back to her kingdom. Ofelia does these tasks and is taken away into strange new worlds and are introduced to several unique creatures. In the real world Ofelia's mother is pregnant and with her evil and overbearing stepfather things are getting a lot worse and seeing as the film is set in the mid 40's during a fascist Spain there is a lot of violence and evil going on around her and sometimes in order to escape that Ofelia will have to go back inside the imaginary world to complete her tasks in order to be somewhere safer even though danger lurks in the fantasy worlds as well. Winner of over 22 awards so far, Pan's Labyrinth has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design and good makeup. Before I state what I liked about the film I would like to get the fact that although this is a fantasy film and looks like it would be great for children that it is probably not suitable for them receiving an R rating in the states for graphic violence and language, so parents please be advised. Getting that out of the way I must say that I really enjoyed this film. When Ofelia is in the fantasy worlds they are full of beauty and are gorgeous looking and at the same time they are often wonderfully grotesque and weird, so the look and effects of this film are fantastic. The imagination behind writer/director Guillermo del Toro is amazing and he has created a wonderful blend of fantasy and real life horror that balances out well and plays perfectly. When in the real world everything is dark, dreary and depressing looking, but while in the fantasy land everything is usually bright and more cheerful. This film plays out like a perfect fairy tale with dark elements, a hero, a villain and lots of weird stuff in between to keep us amazed and to capture our interest. The film is very dark, but anyone who has read fairy tales will be able to tell you that most of them are and it suit's the film and it's style very well. This is a gorgeous looking, creative, interesting and very well done film that is one of the best films of the year and I'm glad there is finally a fantasy film out there for adults to enjoy. I really enjoy fantasy films, but the majority of the recent stuff out there like Lord Of The Rings or Harry Potter isn't really my style, so I'm happy to say that this film certainly filled the bill and I was very impressed by the end of it. For those who are into fantasy and don't mind that the film is dark then you are in for a great story and a wonderful world of surprise that the filmmaker captures for you. I hope this film continues to do well and I hope the fact that it is subtitled does not hold people back from seeing it because it really is an amazing film and meant to be seen.",
201,1 June 2007,paulk-20,1, Harmful at best,"As I see movies made within the past 20 years climb the ranks of the IMDb top 250 with alarming speed, I wonder what on earth is happening. I see that this movie is at #41, higher than Chinatown, The Third Man, To Kill a Mockingbird, Alien, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Metropolis, and even The Wizard of Oz. Does Pan's Labyrinth deserve such high praise? Yes, it is steeped in intellectual metaphor and is crafted in such a Philip K. Dickian manner that the audience is left wondering what was real in the film. I applaud the filmmakers abilities in this manner, but regarding what they are willing to portray, they have the restraint of sociopaths. This movie contains some of the most wretched, horrific violence and psychologically uncomfortable character interactions I have ever seen in a film. Early in the movie, we watch as the cruel Captain Vidal crushes the face of an innocent young man while his helpless father watches. Vidal shoots the father moments later, after the man had to watch his son die in front of him. ",

203,5 November 2006,Passta,2, Extremely overrated,"This is the first time ever I felt the urge to post a comment here on IMDb and this is simply because most of the times I have more or less agreed with what was already written by others. But now, I simply cannot believe this movie has such a high user rating! Did we all watch the same thing? Reading your comments and posts my impression was that this was a movie for grown-ups. But, common! Sometimes the given ""reality"" of this movie seems more fairlytaleish than the actual fantasy bits. The villain could not be more plastic and banal if this were a 007 movie (kills innocent elderly people and little children, beats women, tortures little animals and alike). I mean the Nazis from Indiana Jones and those Frank Capra Why We Fight WWII propaganda movies had more character depth than this one! And the good guys are good guys for the sole premise of being human vs this ultra-evil devilish opponent. There is no solid argument why we should support them apart from the fact that the alternative is a sadistic monster. Now, this movies main idea, or so it seems, is to contrast the actual world of reality to the imaginary world of fairy tales. But they don't differ! At all! The ""reality"" has as little to do with reality as the fairytale. They're as archetypal, as brutal and as imaginary. And seriously, it takes a master film artist to kill a kid and get away with it (like Brian De Palma in the Untouchables, perhaps? or whoever did the movie version of the Lord of the Flies for eg). Otherwise, it seems just pathetic. Like the easiest way to appeal to emotions. For me, this death felt ""undeserved"" because the script was so badly crafted. It felt even offending in a way.",

Much like 'The Passion of the Christ' took a holy subject and degraded it by turning into one of Mel's studies in male homophobic S&M themes, this movie was often tauted as an adult fairy tale. Only if we as adults have decomposed our standards so that torture and suffering constitute fairy tales. Fool me once, shame on you...I will not make any future efforts to see this director's works. Only a small percentage of the movie is dedicated to the fairy tale theme of Pan's Labyrinth, the rest is a poor version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets Passion of the Christ meets Apocalypse Now.

I questioned the logic, the concept of pure evil, etc., from when I first heard them. And honestly, when I initially came into contact with Del Toro's work(with Mimic, possibly nearly ten years ago by now), I did not care for it. It's pretty clear to anyone who's seen any of the flicks by him that he is big on fantasy. And you know what? I didn't love this, but I can be objective enough to see that it is a brilliant piece, and that is largely because of him. He injects such ample amounts of imagination and creativity(and unlike Hellboy 2, he focuses properly, and doesn't put an excess of beings up on the screen, so *everything* otherworldly in this has an impact). This feels like one of the classic stories, and I really mean that, not the Disney-fied, sanitized version, no, the original, from when they were written down and further back. If you don't already know, let me make it clear to you; this is *not* for children. It is an adult film(stop snickering), with themes and visuals not for young minds and eyes. This is disgusting, creepy, grotesque and unpleasant. It is not for everyone. The editing and cinematography, in general, the look of this, is just *gorgeous*. Every acting performance is spot-on. I am thoroughly impressed by the 11-year-old Baquero. To be that talented at that age is always noteworthy. Doug Jones is *the* man you want to put in heavy make-up, and he yet again proves his outstanding dedication. The effects and live-action elements meld rather well. There is a lot of graphic, bloody violence and disturbing content, as well as, apparently, a little strong language(meanwhile, I don't speak Spanish well enough to tell, so...) in this. The DVD holds a brief intro by Guillermo, where he says that this came close to killing him. From the Trivia, he clearly put a ton of effort into this, and it truly paid off. Whether or not you like this or any other movie of his, in my book, he deserves respect. I recommend this to any fan of the genre. 10/10",

A movie completely in Spanish, a movie full of intricate fantasy monsters while being set within the Spanish Civil War. It was a movie never designed for mass crowds to watch it, but rather for people to slowly discover it and admire it. So as I walked into the cinema late last Sunday I was really excited, mainly because I wanted to see whether it would live up to expectations, and whether I could see the beauty of the movie. Now two days after seeing it I have decided to write my review on it, you see it has taken me two days of thinking about it for me to truly appreciate just how amazing the movie is. Pan's Labyrinth goes way beyond being the movie of 2006 within the first hour, what was originally in my mind going to be a nice fantasy movie turned into an epic tale about family, friendship, bravery, inner-demons and the evil that people face. This is a movie that is the closest to perfection I have seen in a long, long time. Previous years have seen movies I perceived as great such as Shaun of the Dead, Pirates of the Caribbean, Finding Neverland, Sin City and others. Pan's Labyrinth manages to top all of them for sheer inventiveness, sheer creativity, sheer beauty and sheer amazingness. It is difficult to write a review on this movie as it really can be interpreted in so many ways, the story is a grown up fairy tale, trust me kids will go screaming out the cinema if they see this movie. Its a movie that deals more with the fascism occurring in the real world than with the horrific monsters in the fantasy world. Its a clever and inventive way to do a movie like this and ultimately the largest risk that Guillermo Del Toro has taken for this movie as well/ Thankfully it pays off perfectly as it gives enough character development for us to genuinely care for the characters and enough time with the fantasy creatures for us to appreciate the beauty of the movie.",

It's kind of a strange intersection, with the fairytale elements put alongside brutal violence and torture, but I think that was part of the point, the innocence lost in war and for Spain under the Franco regime. In the blend of fantasy and reality, I thought the fantasy elements worked better, and I wish there had been more of them. I loved the dreamy feeling of the child from the 'other world' and my favorite part was the Pale Man; the visuals are fantastic in that scene and I loved the Goya reference. The other half of the movie with the resistance fighters is decent, but not as strong as it could have been. It needed more nuance; the captain is cartoonishly evil and the plot is suspect at key points (e.g. a moment when it defies logic for someone not to kill him).

224,20 May 2007,walken_on_sunshine,10, An Epic Masterpiece,"I never really fell into the group of people hyped up for this film, I thought it looked good but too phony and fantasy like not too mention i thought it might turn out like Narnia.Pan's Labyrinth is however one of the best epic fantasy films ever made right up there with Lord Of The Rings, and King Kong in terms of cinematic perfection.The film is not a complete fantasy world like the previews portray it as it is only on consistent occasion that the main character Ophelia enters the world of the Labyrinth where most of the film takes place in the real world on a military base.The film has extremely surprising and violent content and is definitely not a fantasy film for children so for those thinking this will be anything close to Harry Potter, Narnia, or Eragon think again before taking your child to see this relentlessly gory yet artistically beautiful film.If any of you are gamers and have played Resident Evil 4 you'll know of the eerie creatures and hauntingly beautiful settings such as enormous corridors and eerie rooms and a certain scene in Pan's Labyrinth will definitely remind you of what made Resident Evil 4 such a great game to look at.Speaking of visual style the movie does one of the most fantastic jobs at creating a beautiful fantasy world without anything looking cheesy or fake.The CGI is masterful and is probably the best and most realistic use of CGI since King Kong while the props and costumes for the majority of the creates make them feel much more real.The movie does a good job of emotionally drawing you to certain characters and hating other characters so when certain things happen to them you are devastated or extremely happy so the movie does a perfect job in terms of character development and getting you into the film to root for who it wants you to root for.The gore and violence is realistic, stylized, and intense and the blood effects are absolutely amazing, they don't look the very least bit fake.The storyline moves along at a pretty good pace it gets slow very rarely as the action is spaced out well over the course of the movie.In one word i would describe Pan's Labyrinth as ""Epic"".Guillermo Del Toro i've always felt was overrated as i enjoyed Blade 2 and Hellboy but not to the point of thinking ""hey the new Del Toro films out it's gotta be good"" now i see the talent everybody is talking about.Very well done by the entire production it deserved the 3 Academy Awards it received and undeniably should have won the Academy Award for best score over An Inconveniant Truth.This movie is an epic masterpiece i now look forward to Del Toro's work.",

226,23 January 2007,postmanwhoalwaysringstwice,10, spectacular!!!!,"A film like Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" rarely comes around. In it he has merged the epic fantasy with grisly war drama creating a brooding, horrific, yet blissful experience for the eyes and the mind. Its visual scope might be in the ""Lord of the Rings"" realm, yet del Toro keeps his film in under two hours. There's a sense of a far more mature ""Neverending Story"" during that film's second act. Maybe there are echoes of Alfonso Cuar√≥n's brilliant ""A Little Princess"". Some of the drama comes from a child during wartime, like the harrowing tales told in ""Forbidden Games"" or ""Hope & Glory"". Sure, there's all of that and more in ""Pan's Labyrinth"", but honestly it defies all comparison and holds up as one of the most original works to hit screens in many years. It tells the story of a young girl as she travels with her pregnant mother through war-ravaged Spain to live with her new father, a downright evil man. Twelve year old Ivana Baquero offers a marvelous performance as the innocent yet confident, young yet intuitive, Ofelia, who discovers a certain refuge and power in a magical world of mystery and peril lurking within and beneath her new home. In a way the film rekindles that certain innocence in the viewer as well. As we follow this journey, we are bombarded with imagery that may even make the most jaded adult viewer squirm.",

Any director, at this point, must have learned about doing a technically good movie, that's a fact. What we, the audience want, is a good story. But after a while, I was sure of something: I was going to be disappointed. But I waited longer and longer, and the sensation didn't disappeared, only got stronger. Del Toro made a movie about a fabulous tale, but fail on the point of telling the story of Ofelia, a girl taken to the middle of the Civil War in Spain -that actually never concerns or interests her-, and confronted to an evil man who is meant to be his stepfather. She finds a labyrinth that nobody has explored even if is located near the soldiers camp, she goes down and finds out that she might be a princess, but has to go through three dangerous tasks. The faun, Pan, doesn't look believable and the story, itself, doesn't, either. Is she is the lost princess and the king has lived for centuries waiting for her, why does she has to confront dangers and prove it? The movie seems to be conceived as a horror movie, full of creepy sounds, with an evil man (Vidal) in the main character who becomes, at the end, in the only half-developed character in the movie (the mother, Ariadna Gil, appears like a ghost, an empty character), and has dozens, hundreds of unnecessary violence, shootings in the face, torture, blood and only more blood.

Now, seeing it, this film from Mexican director Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Blade II) is a fantastically inventive journey. Basically, set in 1944, during World War II, and young fairytale enthusiast Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is moving with her pregnant mother Carmen Vidal (Ariadna Gil) to live with her new stepfather, the ruthless and Spanish army Captain Vidal (a terrific Sergi Lopez). Not long after arriving, she is taken by a fairy to an old faun, Pan (Doug Jones) in the centre of the labyrinth. He tells her that she is a princess, because she is her soul was once part of the labyrinth. He tells her that she must complete three tasks to prove her royalty, and if she fails, she will never be a real a princess, or see her real king father. These include getting a key from inside a giant frog, getting a knife from the room of a creature that wears its eyes on its hands, and eventually, giving her ""innocent"" blood to the labyrinth, instead of her baby brother. Also starring Maribel Verd√∫ as Mercedes and Alex Angulo as Doctor. The special effects are extraordinary, the violence is eye-catching, and the story is very interesting. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Makeup, and it was nominated for Best Music, Original Score for Javier Navarrete, Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film not in the English Language, Best Costume Design, and Best Make Up & Hair, and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

The imagery is nothing short of breathtaking, and he has made a major discovery with the young actress, Ivana Baquero, who commands the screen for a majority of the two hour running time. It is 1944, in Franco's Spain, during the time of civil unrest. A combination of history and fantasy, blended so seamlessly that I was completely lost in Ofelia's adolescent world of woe. We meet her on the road, traveling with her mother, Carmen(Ariadna Gil), where they stop for a moment, and Ofelia spots a strange, winged insect which she follows to a hole in a tree. It trails the car to a compound where she meets her new stepfather, Vidal(Sergi Lopez), a Captain in the fascist army, fighting guerrillas hiding in the nearby mountains. Carmen is pregnant and a widow who has chosen a loveless marriage to an evil man in order to provide for her children. The insect leads Ofelia to a tree with a labyrinth inside and she is introduced to a faun(a tall et like creature, played by Doug Jones, the one American in the cast who was taught Spanish line by line). He is her teacher and guide to the underworld. He gives her three tasks to perform before the full moon; the first task is removing a key from a giant toad; the second being the retrieval of a knife from a lair, and the third, a daunting task with her new baby brother. She must complete the three missions in order to become Princess Moanna, the queen of the underworld. The story is compelling and the acting tremendous, from Baquero to Sergi Lopez's scowling villain, Captain Vidal, there is nothing to criticize in Pan's Labyrinth and I give it a 10/10.",

The principal character, the young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), manages to interact in both worlds, and each of them are of dark and Gothic design. Considering it's subject matter, one might initially think this would be a good movie for kids to see but there's really too much gruesome violence and mutilation that takes place to make it wholesome for youngsters. The fantasy elements may conjure up images from other films like ""Alice in Wonderland"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"", but again, those pictures were generally a lot more colorful and optimistic in tone. The one thing that disappointed me with the character of Ofelia was when she ate the grapes in the lair of The Pale Man. I really wanted her to display more self control as the heroine of the tale. Unusual too is the idea that the heroine, so called, would actually die at the end of the story, at least in the real world realm. There was some consolation in the fact that she rejoined her father in the spirit world, but the first impression adds to my caution about the film's impact on a young audience.",

Though I had previously never seen any of his films, I now consider del Toro to be a director-to-watch, since his most recent release, 'El Laberinto del fauno / Pan's Labyrinth' is one of the favourite films of 2006, second only to fellow Mexican director Alfonso Cuar√≥n's dystopic futuristic sci-fi, 'Children of Men (2006).' An ""adult fantasy"" in every sense of the word, 'Pan's Labyrinth' unfurls a marvellous fantasy fairytale amid the bloody backdrop of the aftermath of Spanish Civil War (1936-1939).

266,18 November 2006,come2whereimfrom,6, whats all the fuss about?,"With crazy characters, teasing trailers, amazing posters and from various magazines more stars than the night sky I was really looking forward to this film. Sadly for me it didn't live up to the expectation. Overly long but with hardly any character development it looks pretty but is actually quite boring. Set in Spain at a time of upheaval the film flips between the real world and that of a fantasy realm created by Ofelia, who along with her pregnant mother go to live in a rural area will the evil Captain Vidal, not her father but the father to her unborn brother. From the outset we quickly establish that Vidal is a nasty piece of work who only cares about the baby and victory over his enemies at any cost. Ofelia trapped between the captain, the fighting and her ill mother retreats into a made up world where she will be a princess if she completes three tasks given to her by the faun Pan. What follows is a story of the civil unrest in Spain, violence and all, with occasional dips in to Ofelia's vivid imagination as escape. The trouble is that when in Ofelia's mind we are treated to some of the most beautiful CGI committed to screen but its too few and far between to call this a modern day Alice in wonderland. Pan the faun is probably in the two hour film no more than ten minutes if you add together his screen time and the eye hand guy that dominates a lot of the posters and screen shots is only in it for a couple of minutes if that. Sadly billing this as a fantasy film is slightly misleading there is more set in the real world as Vidal and his soldiers try and flush the rebels out of the surrounding woods. All the elements are in place, a passionate visionary director, a story with some truth to it, top notch CGI, great actors, amazing score etc but it always feels that something is missing. I'm sure that the film is packed full of metaphors that when in Ofelia's mind relate to the real world but after sometime I stopped looking for them and started looking for what made all the critics salivate, I haven't seen so much praise heaped on a film for ages but unfortunately for me I couldn't quite see why it deserved so much. Pan's isn't a bad film just, unlike myself, go in without any preconceptions and you will probably enjoy it a hell of a lot more.",

It is to Del Toro's great credit that both the film's two worlds are not only convincing in their own right but are seamlessly and intelligently blended together, a cleverly edited and very stylish early sequence has Ofelia trying to calm her kicking unborn brother with a story as the camera pans down to show the baby's foetus and then across to the beautiful flower in a field of thorns from Ofelia's story and then follows the insect-like fairy back into the room with Ofelia and her mother. The special effects and editing here are superb and this mixing of reality and story gains the appearance of happening in a single tracking shot. As would be expected from the director of Hellboy, the art direction and design in the fantasy scenes is amazing. The finest such sequence comes courtesy of the Pale Man, a figure who has dominated all the pre-publicity for the film and yet, sat totally still at a table with a great feast and his eyeballs on a plate beside him, he cuts a brilliantly disturbing and strange figure the like of which we have never seen; and that is before he gets up, inserts the eyeballs into the palm of his hands and staggers after the terrified Ofelia. The faun, meanwhile, is no friendly, bumbling Mr. Tumnus, but an imposing, sinister figure who we are never entirely sure is worthy of our trust. He is also a creature that appears truly to be a part of nature, seeming to emerge from the rocks of his labyrinth when he first appears, when he describes himself as the mountains and the earth and the woods, he really looks like it. The majority of the film, however, occurs not in the fantasy world of the labyrinth but the very real world of the house of Captain Vidal. Played with great skill by Sergi Lopez, the captain is a terrific and yet very real kind of evil, a man who wants everything to be perfectly ordered and is pained by the notion of anything not being just as he desires it. Even his brutal torture method must follow a set pattern and script each time. Vidal's love of rigorous routine is further displayed in the classic Del Toro motif of clockwork as the captain is seen constantly winding his watch, a reminder also that he lives perpetually in the shadow of his father, a military hero whose watch stopped at the exact time of his death, a symbol to show his son how a great man dies. This, of course, raises another significant point about Vidal. He is, essentially, a small man, a man who is dedicated to following orders (the wrongness of blindly following orders is a further anti-Fascist theme of the film, contrasting the doctor's remarks on Vidal's never questioning attitude to Ofelia's reactions to the faun wanting her to do whatever he says). In the small world of the film he may seem like the great evil but he is just a small part of a rotting society. As the hiding rebels say, they may get rid of Vidal but Franco can always send another in his place. The real world of Pan's Labyrinth is a dark one, not just in the grim, gruesome violence dealt out by Captain Vidal but in the sense of being trapped here and, as voiced by Ofelia's mother, the feeling that this difficulty is the way that the world is. There is little wonder, therefore, that Ofelia retreats into the fantasy world offered by the faun. Del Toro leaves his audience in doubt as to whether this world is real or a product of Ofelia's troubled imagination, giving suggestions either way in the course of the film. With her stack of story books and the way she instantly perceives the strange insect creature as a fairy, Del Toro certainly gives his heroine an imagination he can relate to. While the usage of another book, blank until she fills it with her touch, as Ofelia's link her fantasy world tasks suggests the director's love of the power of stories. Real or otherwise, Ofelia sees her tasks as an escape from the imposing world of Vidal's house. She feels isolated, alone and misunderstood with her mother ill and in bed, her new stepfather unconcerned and no other children, so she jumps at the chance to prove herself to the faun. When he leaves after her failure to follow the rules she is broken and when he gives her one last chance it gives her new life. Del Toro's real strength in this film is not the visual creativity he normally brings as a director but the human emotional impact that he creates here as a writer. Ofelia, in a brilliant, charming and winning performance from young Ivana Baquero, is a heroine who really engages the audience's sympathies. Creative, resourceful and brave, she is a likable character whose feelings of being lost and alone among this dark, grown up world anybody who has been a child can relate to in some way. The fact that Baquero's performance shows her as obviously scared and yet managing to conquer her fears and go forward to complete her tasks, especially evident in the toad scene, makes Ofelia believable and yet heroic and Pan's Labyrinth more than just a dark fairy tale for adults. It is a powerful emotional piece and the final scenes will bring a tear to your eye. A film that deserves to be seen by everyone not just the small audiences that normally frequent subtitled pictures, Pan's Labyrinth is not just Del Toro's finest film but the finest film by any director this year.",

Well no, but it is a well crafted, fabulously photographed and darkly violent imaginative fantasy film.

The story is set in WWII where devastation is all around and the child, her mother and many others have tragic endings. This film is on my top 5 of hated films of all time.

278,6 March 2007,nycritic,10, Guillermo del Toro's Dark Fantasy,"A stunning story drenched in symbolism (that may get somewhat lost in translation for anyone unfamiliar with Spain and/or Spanish culture), this is a gorgeous, lush dark fable that deftly intertwines myth and reality, illusion and bleakness, despair and hope, horror and ecstasy in such an intricate fashion it becomes virtually impossible to distinguish when one story begins and when one end. That in itself is a feat, because so many times the disparity of two different worlds, or two time periods, or two opposing story lines that dovetail at a singular event somewhere within the fabric can present roughness in its seams and look shabby -- almost sloppy. It's the delicate line that Peter Jackson traversed in his epic translation of J. R. R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"", to make a story detailed yet fluid, and it's one that Guillermo del Toro walks with tremendous ease -- he practically flits through his stories with the ease of the fairies that he devotes so much time to. And what a story this is: one that deserves to be seen over and over again, one which owes a bit to Victor Erice's EL ESPIRITU DE LA COLMENA, another bit to Stephen King's novel ""Rose Madder"", yet another bit to THE WIZARD OF OZ.

280,8 April 2007,denis888,9," Very tragic, very good","Some people think mistakenly that Pan's Labyrinth is a children's movie, but this is certainly not the one. The very plot is very cruel, dark, gloomy and not so serene. The story takes place in 1944, in General Franco's fascist Spain, where small, but active partisan's detachments still continue their struggle. The main heroine, little girl named Ophelia, comes with her pregnant Mom to the idyllic countryside to see her step-father, fascist Captain, a murderous, ruthless villain, with no human feature left. The story then goes in two parallel lines ¬ñ one is dark, terrible reality of WWII, with its battles, executions, tortures, partisan actions and fierce cruelty on Nazi's side; another is a deep, mystical fairy tale with Pan, faeries, horrible eyeless monster, magic chalk and a brave girl Ophelia who really wants to help her Mom and her yet unborn son. At times, the film becomes so intensely cruel, so bloody and so mercilessly real that it's hard to watch and not be shocked with how terrible any war can be. And the fairy part is also very dark, frightening and spooky, it is not a sweet bedtime moralist story, nay, it is far too real, too. The never-ending succession of deaths of several main heroes leaves a heavy trace on your heart and the very ending, with its honey-golden hues of color, its openly Christian moral and its sweeter tones is probably the only light spot in the whole deeply tragic and very convincing story. The film is a big winner on the side of Mr. Del Toro as a director, writer and main originator, and the Captain's part, played by Mr. Lopez, is truly a genius of bright, persuading performance of sheer brilliance and great talent. Not a film for kids, but still, this is a must for those whop seem to forget how bad Nazism is and how abominable any war may be.",

A lot of foreign language movies in America are completely overlooked because of the other movies that are being advertised, but Pan's Labyrinth doesn't do that. It stays in your mind forever.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" works. Mexican director Guillermo del Toro tells a little girl's story in fascist Spain of 1944, and it is full with mythology, symbols, lush colors, jaw dropping scenery, dreamlike music and lots of imagination. Coming from his heart, conceived years before he finally could commit it to celluloid, del Toro knows what strings to pull in the film which he also authored. As a director he prefers real sets, miniature shots and actors over CGI, and while the latter has its part as well, it is more a supportive role in order to tell the tale. Said tale is far more than the traditional good versus evil, it's about contrasts and the collision of worlds for sure, but also about choices within and outside realities if you will, about convictions and truths only found in one's self.",

There is one pinnacle scene that appears more manipulative without explanation during the banquet scene. Both overly simple and complex, the special effects are good, the set design engulfing. Unlike Chronicles of Naria (2005), Harry Potter, Jumanji (1995), Lord of the Rings, The Neverending Story, Spirited Away (2002), Time Bandits (1981), Pan has a more wrenching fantastical atmosphere that almost tears the genre apart.

There are really two stories in this film. The first concerns fighting in the Spanish civil war between the established government and rebels. The second involves a little girl and her mother who's expecting and arriving to live with their new father and husband. He happens to be a ruthless & prideful General for the government who will do anything to stop the uprising of the rebels and to have a son and heir to his throne, apparently. The girl finds a labyrinth on the grounds and starts encountering different fantasy characters as she explores it. The movie is a combination of the harsh reality of the situation and the endearing fantasies of a little girl who's trapped in a reality that's almost too hard to bear. This is definitely not a children's movie because of the intense emotions depicted and the things that happen to the character's throughout.

Many aesthetic-narrative aspects are important in Pan's Labyrinth: the two worlds, the real and the imaginary, are well demarcated in the film with very specific dramatic intensities. The Real World is marked by strong scenes of violence with the right to torture, sadism, hemorrhages, torn jaws and subsequently sewn together and many gunshots. The Imaginary World lived by Ophelia is marked by very intense discoveries that begin to happen when she enters the Labyrinth of the Faun, guided by a mysterious insect. Her encounter with Fauno and her fantastic characterization recalls many encounters in Fairy Tales such as Beauty and the Beast and Little Red Riding Hood with the Wolf, all with an implicit erotic content. The transformation of a repellent praying mantis into a fairy is reminiscent of Wendy's encounter with Peter Pan's Fairy Tinkerbell, not to mention the more direct and referent readings such as Alice in Wonderland and The Thousand and One Nights, with the references contained in the words of the Faun who claims that Ophelia is a Princess of the Underground World.",

This is an excellent movie based upon whatever criteria you wish to apply, although the most difficult criterion would be ""what's it like and is it better?"" as it is quite unlike anything else. The fantasy sequences and characters are astonishing, and are used sparingly and so more effectively than you may anticipate from the trailer. This is far from Jim Henson's Labyrinth ¬ñ a grim meditation on the evil that men may do rather than a happy-go-lucky coming of age parable, and is a film that truly explores the horrific darkness that lies at the heart of the best fairy tales.

Ofelia also meets and befriends Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), the housekeeper whose brother is fighting in the Spanish resistance. Ofelia discovers a labyrinth in the garden of the house where Faun (Doug Jones), keeper of the labyrinth, tells her that she is the long lost princess of the underworld and she must complete three tasks before the full moon in order for her to take her place in the underworld. Meanwhile, Mercedes smuggles food, letters, and supplies to her brother's resistance army under the nose of the psychotic Captain Vidal.

This film is so visually stunning and the story really takes you in and never lets go. Ivana Baquero is a star in the making! Lovely and innocent as Ofelia she carries the film so bravely and with the genteel of a young lady. Maribel Verdu is also lovely and wonderful as the woman whose own journey mirrors to that of the little Ofelia.

'Who would believe a turning teenager who still reads fairy tales that says that there are such magical wonderful creatures like fairies and other creatures of the woods?' -ignore the grammar- Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) played an amazing role as the daughter of Carmen Vidal (Ariadna Gil), of course her Princess Moanna role, and the older sister of the newborn child. She was amazingly brave throughout every task, the crawling and meeting of the Toad, and of course the last scene is truly without words -Everytime I type the name Ofelia, I begin to get the reenactment of the last scene, it's pretty mind blowing-. She even played the real life role of a young teenager, 'always curious and never obeys', so she decides to check something out of the huge feast on the long table. When the little fairy friends told her not to do so, during that entire scene, I was like speaking out for the fairies: ""No, no, no... young lady, put that back down.."", ""No, you must not, remember the rules.."", ""Oh no, see what you've done!"" and so on...

If it was written in novel form, it would be a true fantasy fiction classic. The world itself is imbedded in the dark atmosphere of the Spanish Civil War. Yet it emphasizes the values of family, not in its traditional senses, but through the lens of fantasy, the magic and unpredictability of family is strengthened with imagery. The only thing or cure that can transcend the physical separation and ideological differences with each other is the common need for love (emphasized by the mandrake). When the mandrake is thrown in the fire, it is the abandonment of love, and that is emphasized through fantasy as life itself. So when one willingly gives their life up for a stranger through this shared sense of love, it forms such a connection that transcends both ideology and war itself. That is what Del Toro's masterpiece portrays in its vivid and highly imaginative world of fantasy. A truly gripping film, and an evocative masterpiece that transcends any further description.",

I actually mistook the title to be a reference to Pandora's Box (not the god Pan) - since the preview I saw showed a young girl opening a box and some kind of dark spirits coming out. While watching the film I couldn't help but also reference other stories. Ofelia/Ophelia (of Shakespeare's Hamlet), driven mad by politics and deaths.

At the very least, the powerful imagery, and great combination of special & practical effects made it worth it.",

In October we got The Departed and The Prestige. In November we got Babel, Stranger than Fiction and The Fountain. And this December we got Apocalypto, Children of Men and this film; Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, which is yet again, another great film, and in my opinion one of my favorite films of the year. I know I've been saying that a lot this time of year, but it's so true. This is the last great film to what I have considered to be a relatively good year for movies. This year's Oscars are going to a very close race, and as I see it Pan's Labyrinth has already won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year. I shall accept nothing less; my mind is already made up.",
380,2 February 2015,Thanos_Alfie,8, Another view from Guillermo del Toro...,"""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a fantasy movie which is combined really good with some historical events. In this movie we are in the falangist Spain of 1944 and we watch all the bad things that happened in that time in Spain from the eyes of a bookish young stepdaughter of a sadistic army officer. We also watch how difficult was the situation in those times and of course the war between the two sides.",
381,13 January 2007,dmturner,6, Didn't love it as much as most,"Because everyone else had waxed so euphoric over this film, I went with high expectations. However, though I enjoyed it, I did not find it to be as extraordinary as I was led to expect. For one thing, the Faun is an awkward and crude creation, with a mad hint of Muppet about him; perhaps my vision has been spoiled by the proliferation of special effects in recent decades. For another, the movie was so dark and claustrophobic (both in the fantasy scenes and in the ""real-life"" scenes) that it was almost a caricature. The young lead actress was excellent, as were all the actors. However, the story line with its noble Nationalists, sadistic captain, innocent child, and bed-ridden mother-to-be struck me as hackneyed. Perhaps I am betraying my age, and all this seems new to everyone else who sees it.",

I mean, there's nothing wrong with the film itself, it's an interesting, clever and dark story of how a young girl copes with her grief via fantasy's, set in the fascist Spain of 1944. What I found that let the film down was reading and hearing all these brilliant reviews of how this film was one of the greatest movies of the past 10 years, nay, one of the greatest films EVER created. And that was my problem - it was a good film, but it wasn't brilliant, and after expecting so much more, I felt hollow at the end of this film, like I'd been cheated out of an incredible movie.",

I don't want to give away the story because it's good and original and I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone, but I will say that it is in Spanish and when I saw it there were English subtitles, in case anyone was wondering. Also, this film is good because it has not only lots of special effects and a fantasy feel, but because it shows the reality of what happened in Spain before...Very well combined...

One of the most original films in a long time the film blends fantasy and reality seamlessley. The film is often extremely violent which adds to the contrast between the fantasy and reality. I believe this film will go down as a classic in years to come and really should be seen by everyone who has an interest in film.

The movie is dark and twisted but tells a great story about a young girl struggling during the Francoist period. There are many twists in the movie and the creatures that Del Toro brings to life are incredibly creepy. The ending is very open-ended in terms of what could be real and what could be fake, which is why this movie really shines.

British viewers said the movie was gore, which it isn't, based on all the horror/thriller movies I may have seen since the 80s. In fact, the general public thought about this movie as a dark fantasy, a darker version of the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" perhaps, but they were wrong in that this movie wasn't made for British people who go to artsy international cinema, cocooned by the idea that ""art"" can be an excuse for all sorts. As a viewer, I would say that what was disturbing was that you can feel a certain unease in the main character's life experience, maybe because fairy tales do take chunks of real life and exaggerate them until you realise you can't stand it anymore. Consequently, the movie, far from being the usual dark fantasy anyone was expecting, turns out to be a real psychological eye-opener to the world of children and their monsters. Highly recommended viewing.",

'Labyrinth' is, without a doubt, one of the most magical pieces of film-making I've ever had the pleasure of seeing, with a rich and compelling story to be told.

I found this film almost unwatchable in its graphic violence. The characters seemed to me to be just overdrawn stereotypes and the situations - such as the childbirth scene and its outcome - obvious and clich√©d. The Captain was an appalling sadist without a redeeming feature; the housemaid was sweet and saintly. When it was over my companion turned to me and said: 'Well what was that all about?' 'A fairy tale for adults' is hardly an adequate answer. What was the point of the fantasy sequences? I could understand if they were the child's way of escaping the horrible reality around her; but the fantasies were equally frightening. What was the filmmaker trying say ? Why did he set it in the aftermath of the Spanish civil war - was it supposed to be some sort of allegory for Iraq? I was totally baffled, as well as being sickened by the violence. I detect a trend of thought among critics and the Academy that anything made by a Spanish or Mexican director must be great. That may be the case with Almodovar, but then he's a genius.",

408,27 January 2007,meeza,9, Pantastical!,"Director Guillermo Del Toro's numinous, mesmerizing ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is the foreign film feast of the year. Take a trip to this fantasyland where dreams can come true! I know! Shameless Disney plug! Anyway, enter to my ""Pun's Labyrinth"" so I can guide you to the mastery of ""Pan's Labyrinth"". Child actress Ivana Baquero stars as Ofelia, the daughter of an ailing pregnant mother named Carmen. Ofelia's mom is married to Capitan Vidal, a malicious, ruthless Spanish leader who might be the supreme villain of the year in film. Ofelia is miserable in her existence until she inadvertently comes to the path of a magical labyrinth inhabited by a Pan. Mr. Panman leads her into a mystical journey that is filled with majesty and oddity that makes it the proper escape for the troubled child. Pan informs Ofelia that she was a princess that has been resurrected in her life-form. Pan also provides Ofelia the unearthly goods to cure her mother. However, Ofelia still has to persevere her cruel real world of being controlled by Captain Vidal. Let's just say that Captain Vidal's vicious demeanor makes Saddam Hussein look like_________ (sorry to keep you ""hanging"" with the Saddam reference , remember you are in ""Meeza's Pun Labyrinth"") Mother Teresa. I think Captain Vidal's daily liquid nutrition is primarily comprised of Captain Morgan juices. He massacres innocent peasants, assassinates his own Spaniards, beats his wife, and abuses children. That is the harsh ""verdad"" on Vidal. Mercedes is Vidal's primary housekeeper which grows an affectionate bond with Ofelia. In the Labyrinth, Ofelia encounters supernatural experiences that have profound impacts in her natural existence. The ghoulish Labyrinth character that is a must-see of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is the Paleman! He has the ""white stuff""! He is creepy, whimsical, and visualize this: his eyeballs are on the palms of his hands. And by no means, don't mess with his fruit!!!!!!! You will see why when you un-vegetate yourself to see the film. The acting of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was nothing short of spectacular! Baquero was endearing as Ofelia. Adriana Gil's work was not ailing as mother Carmen. Maribel Verdu of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" was convincing enough to demonstrate that she was caring enough to be ""la mama tambien"" of Ofelia. Sergi Lopez was captivating in his work as the devilish Captain Vidal. Doug Jones was dually ""doug""-on great as Pan & The Pale Man. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" cinematic labrytory was also embodied with excellence: Guillermo Navarro's cinematography, Jose Quetglas' makeup, Eugenio Caballero's art direction, and Javier Navarrete's musical score was phenomenal. However, it was Writer-Director Guillermo Del Toro's vision that was the catalyst of the brilliant success of ""Pan's Labyrinth"". This Del Toro is a visionary genius, and that is no bull about Del Toro! Make ""Pan's Labyrinth"" your next stop in your cinematic journey! ***** Excellent",

It is not so much impressive in the way that CG is in Avatar but it is on it's own level. You just have to see it to understand. The story is very heavy and powerful. Some scenes were so shocking and powerful that I was actually shaking. There are horror movies that deal with strange and unlikely things like zombies, and don't get me wrong I love a good zombie or vampire movie. However, a film like this one that deals with war in a very smart and real way has a much bigger impact when something really bad happens than a movie that is clearly make believe. This movie deals with make believe and the surreal in a way that few other movies have been able to pull off well. What Dreams Come attempted this and did not quite hit the mark, this movie does a much better job of contrasting and blending what is real and what is imagination. Brilliant, brilliant movie.

Movies of this caliber usually come around once in a generation. And after ""Lord of the Rings"", I was sure that it would be 20 years before I would see another film as entertaining as this one. Although I am not a big fan of foreign language films, I was totally amazed at the magical storytelling and visual feasts displayed here. Although the film is rated R, it does not contain any drug content or sex scenes, even though the violence is quite graphic at times.

Although the movie gave me some perspective on the brutality of the Spanish Civil War (I used to live in Spain), the actual graphic violence in the movie was completely unnecessary. It was downright vile. Del Torro takes the visual representation of violence right down to cheap hack'em up-slash'em up levels. Disgusting.

Throughout the film there is a contrast between the fairytale land that the young Ofelia is mixed up in and the brutal goings on of the Spanish Civil War that surround her. One minute fairies flutter around her face, and the next minute we see her step father - ""el capit√°n"" - shooting two suspected propagandists at point blank range. The acting is very powerful throughout, with the perfect balance of innocence and enquiry from young Ivana Baquero as Ofelia, and a very convincing 'baddie' in Sergi L√≥pez's Capit√°n Vidal, seeming to show absolutely no love for anything or anyone, other than his future child who he is sure will be a son - when the doctor says that it is not certain the baby will be male, the Captain replies 'no me jodas' (don't f*** with me). The film is beautiful from start to finish, with CGI perfectly fusing with the real rural images of a lodge deep in the forest. The film uses the horrific nature of the war to give added power without becoming overly politicised, for which del Toro must be commended. Overall a fantastic piece of film-making, and I look forward to seeing it again.",

The direction is so subtle and flawless, the cinematography is great like The Pianist meets Tim Burton movies, the story is very engaging, interesting, the creatures are so creative (like some other Del Toro movies, for example, the creature whose eyes are above his hands), the content is brilliant, it blends realistic war dramas with fairy tales (fantasy cinema), technically it looks perfect, it has some real shocking moments and a great final waits for us! It is not my personal opinion exactly, all these things are obvious (I don't want to say fact, because it would be too definite) Then why those people hate and say very bad things about it? Do they have a reasonable, acceptable reason? It seems they have not, but the question is I don't know why they do that? Just trolling? I don't say that I am one hundred percent objective, but the movie delivers on cinematography, direction, content, messages and technically. Then, what is the problem or problems of the movie? Because of this incomprehensible hate, those people say ridiculous things like the leading actress was ugly or the movie is a propaganda. Well, this will be personal, but the girl was beautiful and so likable (I wished to enter the screen and help the girl!) and the movie was not a propaganda, instead it was a criticism of fascism !!! Pan's Labyrinth is the movie that turned Del Toro into a master director and it seems that he will never reach that success again, because it was that great, he made one of the best movies of all time! And personally, it is in my top 25 (of all time) The world that Ofelia is gotten within is so interesting and the most important appealing and it is much better than Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland (sorry Burton) Pan's Labyrinth's fantasy world is not so colorful, not as colorful as Tim Burton's movies, but not as a flaw. The first violent attempt was real shocking, it is seriously disturbing, but since it does not serve our entertainment (it serves the criticism), it is positively effective. The movie is also enjoyable, even if not throughout, for example the toad scene was amusing. As for the messages of the movie, to neglect in wife, baby discrimination (hate for female babies), fascism etc. etc. How many movies put all these things together and even perfectly? None !!! The knife scene, the most shocking violent moment of the movie and recalled me of course Joker, was one of the unforgettable moments of the movie (and may be in the cinema history!) And the following scene in front of the mirror was also a subtle, impressive directing success! And in the final, there is a moment which extremely thoughtful and open to discuss. A note: it couldn't have been implied better. The movie ends in a not clich√© way (you are my man Del Toro!) This is an original, uncommon ending, not a clich√© and audience-driven one that generally blockbusters use.",

430,8 February 2013,nesfilmreviews,10," An enchanting, dark fairy tale for adults.","Acclaimed director Guillermo del Toro (""Hellboy"", ""The Devil's Backbone""), creates one of the most exciting and visually stunning adult-themed fables ever. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of the cinema's great fantasies--rich with darkness and wonder. It's a fairy tale of such potency and grandeur, that it reconnects the adult imagination to our primal thrill, and horror stories that held us spellbound as children. As gruesome and brutal as it is enchanting and spellbinding--""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a movie intended for adults. It is a harsh, uncompromising film--but equally just as beautiful and moving.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is itself a narrative maze, with multiple stories that branch apart and back together again. This dark fairy tale plays out against the backdrop of Spain in 1944. A monstrous Fascist captain (L√≥pez) is determined to flush out soldiers of the resistance, as his pregnant wife arrives at his countryside headquarters with her young daughter. The young girl Ofelia (Baquero), escapes the brutality of her new environment by drifting into a fantasy world where she comes across a mysterious faun. The faun tells her that she is a princess from a kingdom in the underground. The faun also tells that her that her father is waiting for her, but she needs to accomplish three challenging and dangerous assignments first. Ofelia's challenges do not arise like arbitrary plot obstacles--they are organic to her (and the movie's) development. She learns not only to follow instructions--and that there are heavy prices to pay for failing to abide by them. But also to trust her own instincts about what is right and wrong. In order to find her true self, she must also find the her inner-strength to break the rules imposed by authority. An individual conscience. What could be a more powerful anti- fascist weapon than that? In a dark, harsh, and violent world, Ofelia lives in her magical world trying to survive her tasks and see her father again. Soon, the line between fantasy and reality begins to blur, and before Ofelia can turn back, she finds herself at the center of the ferocious battle between Good and Evil. Incredibly unique fable that blends fantasy and fearsome violence, ultimately merging the two stories together. Superbly realized--a rare film that invites repeated viewings to fully absorb all that writer- director del Toro has put into it. Oscar winner for Cinematography, Makeup, and Art Direction.",

442,12 November 2006,guilhem_nou,9, One of the best fantasy films ever.,"Spain, 1944. It is the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. In the Pyrenees, an arrogant Nationalist officer (Capt. Vidal, a frightening Sergi L√≤pez), who has established his headquarters in a remote hamlet in the forest, is ruthlessly tracking down the last remnants of the Republican forces, who are hiding in the mountains. His pregnant wife and her daughter from her previous marriage arrive at the hamlet to live with him but are kept there in near-seclusion by the insensitive officer. The girl, Ofelia, escapes the cruelty of the Civil War and of her dour stepfather through an imaginary world filled with fairies. The entrance to her fantastical world is a stone labyrinth guarded by an ambiguous faun pretending to be her servant /hence the title of the film/. Throughout the film, Capt. Vidal reveals his penchant for criminal behaviour whilst we are left wondering whether Ofelia's fantastical world is imaginary or real. El Laberinto del Fauno's major success lies in intertwining the harsh, unglamorous reality of the Spanish Civil War with Ofelia's fantasies, even more so than in Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures. For me, this is really El Laberinto del Fauno's major breakthrough. Where, for instance, the Harry Potter or the Narnia stories could be set in any time, any location, El Laberinto del Fauno is inextricably linked with the terror wrought by Franco's fascist regime. Also, Ofelia's fate is much more traumatic than Harry Potter's or than Tolkien's Hobbits' because the most horrid monster of the film, in the end, is not the faun or the Pale Man, but Capt. Vidal. And, alas, it has been proved many times in history that the vilest monsters have always been human beings. Highly recommended (but not for children!).",

I can only conjecture that this is due to America's love for gore/horror movies. The gratuitous violence in this film is not only entirely unnecessary (we already know that the Capitan is evil, and blood spurting is not poetry unless you are a closet sadist), it seems to have been included simply for the entertainment of audiences who appreciate gore. The assertion that kids may appreciate it is just plain wrong. My 8 year old nephew is quite used to seeing foreign films as well as cartoons, but refused to see Pan's Labyrinth and certainly would have walked out of it in the very first scene. Some have compared Pan's Labyrinth to the sublime beauty of Spirit of the Beehive, which my 8 year old nephew loved, and that is like comparing fine dining with KFC. Sure, both serve dinner, but what kind of dinner? Pan's Labyrinth is a horror movie for horror movie audiences, who would probably find it tedious to have to sit through the non-violent, non-fantasy scenes, which were the only parts which I found palatable. File this movie under gore/horror, not drama. And don't bring a child, not unless you are trying to acclimate him/her to a world of brutal sadism.",

In the past time, the fairy-tales were created to bring some lesson to our life, but where is any idea coming from this film? In the scene where Ofelia comes under temptation nobody understands why she did so, the temptation just does not seem to be so appealing at all and the consequences could be disastrous. There are many miracle things we can meet in life, but this fairy-tale is vulgarizing them. I found the film so boring that only my friends made me to stay until the end, but we all didn't like it.

The girl, Ophelia comes across a labyrinth in which she meets a faun. He gives her three tasks to complete by the full moon to prove she is the lost daughter of the King of the underworld. This movie shows her doing the tasks and dealing with the complications of the mother's pregnancy. It is an extremely moving story of a soul's journey to its father. As you watch the movie you can see that the cinematography, especially the lighting, corresponds with the meaning and outcome of the movie. Pan's Labyrinth is a movie with great spiritual insight on who we are and who our father is. Unquestionably one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I recommend this movie, as it gives a glimpse of the deeper meaning of the world.",
458,31 March 2007,Andy-296,8," Great film, but not a masterpiece","1944. Spain has just come out of the civil war, and the fascist Franco regime is in power. A small group of republican fighters, though, hold on to a small territory in the remote forested mountains of northern Spain. There, a girl named Ofelia, fascinated with fairy tales, arrives with her sick mother to meet her stepfather, a brutal captain of the regime keen on exterminating the remnant republicans. Living with the military in an old mill, at night Ofelia meets a fairy who takes her to an old Faun, which urges her to complete three treacherous tasks. The movie, thus, occurs both in ""reality"" and in fantasy. I like Del Toro's previous Hellboy. Pan's Labyrynth is also a great movie, but I think it was just a bit overrated. The movie is well made, the atmosphere and special effects are great, the plot holds your attention, the performances are great. So why I'm a bit hesitant to endorse this movie as a masterpiece? I'm not totally sure, but the movie may be too ""arty"" for its own good, the film is just a bit too neat, straining for significance while trying to attract both terror film fans and art movie buffs, while probably pleasing neither completely.

It was a fantastic movie; great plot, great actors, and great direction. That said, I simply cannot give it a perfect 10-star rating just because there were so many scenes that were way too sadistic and gory! This is definitely not a movie you want to show to your kid (it's R-rated just for the violence), and you might consider not watching it yourself if you're a faint-hearted person. The sensitive parts aren't just simple fighting or whatever's shown in the average movie. They're pure savagery!

I am not saying that the film isn't stunning with it's special effects and it's brilliant, dark, gritty story but I was just taken aback by the content. First of all it is hard to call this film a fantasy and even consider it on the same level as Lord Of The Rings, or Chronicles of Narnia because the actual fantasy content is barely a blip in the film. There might be perhaps 1/4 of the film that features this magical land she journeys to. Now that 1/4 truly has some brilliant, almost disturbing and magical effects that are spell binding and the outside world content is so dark and violent. I honestly believed Pan's Labyrinth was a child's movie when it was originally released and it's the FURTHEST thing from it. Pan's Labyrinth is an adult film through and through and deserves an R-Rating with some brutally violent death scenes. Still the film moved a little slowly for my liking and just didn't capture me the way I had hoped. I want to love it, I still want to see it again to see if I can find some more appreciation for it because it IS so beautiful but I have to stick with my first impressions and it just wasn't perfect.

The same reservations I had for his Best Picture Oscar winner, I hold for this, ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but this earlier picture also lacks the reflexive inversion of a classic film (in that case, ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954) to partially make up for it. I held out hope, too, finally coming to this due to rumors of it sharing similarities with Lewis Carroll's Alice books, for which I've been seeking a bunch of related movies lately. Unfortunately, besides the rabbit-hole-like entries to a fantasy land, the dress and the business with small doors, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" doesn't really have anything to do with Alice's adventures; instead, it's a bland conflation of a generic fairy tale seemingly of del Toro's own design.

But it also has an epic feel, and a certain poetic grandeur, and manages to pull off its mixture of realism and make-believe without descending into silliness. There are other films that better capture the ambiguity of internal conflict; but this is still a movie of originality and power.",

I kept wanting it to end, and cared for none of the characters, from the viciously cruel captain to the incredibly stupid princess. If you want to see a good movie this year, go see Babel or The Queen. Something that actually makes sense. Or put in your Lord of the Rings trilogy and watch some excellent high fantasy. Something that actually has a plot and interesting characters. This also is not a movie you should take your kids to see. There are some incredibly brutal scenes. Many children were in the theatre and a lot were openly disgusted. This movie is horrible. Don't waste your time or money.",

I just wanted to vanish, not be left in a house full of people. It's rare that a film captures me so deeply, that I'm able to actively watch it without a live critique going on in my head. This is a sample of film-making at it's finest. Using the language of cinema to say something more about a time and a place. Putting his best metaphors forward, the filmmaker harnesses the reason why imagination exists, and juxtaposes it brilliantly with a brutal war. I was astounded by this film. I expected more of the Labyrinth, and less of the war; but that's just a preconception based on advertising. Despite the lack of David Bowie, this film was the best I've seen all year.",

While the story holds a some-what simple, straight forward plot, it is entwined with spectacular imagery, intelligent writing, and some of the most captivating moments that have ever hit the big screen. While this film by definition is considered a fantasy piece, it has a bit of something for everyone; making it an enjoyable film for all walks of life.

Finally, we saw this yesterday and I was outright blown away by the story. Guillermo Del Toro's writing crafted an incredible fantasy world while keeping the movie dark and serious.

I dont think the story line of Pan's Labyrinth is fantastic per say, it definitely felt very loosely written, and I did not expect the film to be so heavily based around the war and so little on the actual labyrinth. But regardless, Guillermo's cinematic style is absolutely astounding. The fantastic creatures, the art, and the mood in each scene captivates how magical Ophelia's fantasy world was.

Viewing people being shot different ways and multiple times or tortured for the sake of show is not entertainment. Neither is the sadism and the brutality of one of the main characters - a Captain in the Spanish military. However the backdrop (yes backdrop) story or fairy tale is well depicted and conceived and twisted in an almost Burton-like way. One of the lead fairy tale creatures is a definite rip-off from ""The Cat's Eye"" troll (with Drew Barrymore), but that's OK. Too bad the setting/war completely ruins any wonder or art related to the fairytale. The fairytale itself lifts the movie as best it can, but with so much senselessness and a boring lead character with little charm coming off a little dull, the movie suffers. Keeping the fairytale as a base and some rework could've done justice. It ultimately and sadly is lost on the potential the fairytale cant reach.",

Even though it is like a fairy tale, it is rated R for a reason: not for kids. This is a very violent and bloody movie. The scene with the captain beating a man to death in the head was one of the most gruesome scenes in film history. It was worse than what they show in your average slasher flick. Ofelia travels to live with an evil Captain with her pregnant mother who has married the captain. She finds a fairy who leads her through a labyrinth to a mysterious fawn. He tells her she is a princess who must complete three dangerous tasks in order to find immortality.

494,16 May 2007,judywalker2,7, Interesting,I thought this film from a technical perspective was very well done. But I have to say that the adult characters were much more interesting than watching the antics of Ofelia (especially in her Alice in Wonderland dress). Her story was all too familiar and I knew exactly what was going to happen before it happen. It was the same for the adult characters and its too bad that the fantasy that Ofelia had didn't incorporate more of what was happening around her. The only connection appeared to be with her mother and that's ashame. Also the task that the faun had her do seemed to say nothing about her situation or the situation of those around her. It also would have been nice to know more about the Captain and his relationship to his father and why a son was so important to him. All in all a good technical film with story flaws. 7/10,

It's really about strength, courage, innocence and a will to do what is right above all else, no matter what the cost to one's self. This is a true masterpiece of film-making, from the gorgeously lush countryside to the dingy interiors. I will say this, as much as I truly enjoy this movie: I will never forgive Guillermo for making me cry so hard I almost heaved. No one else has ever hurt me that badly, and done it so beautifully. You owe it to yourself to watch this film as soon as possible. Just don't forget to bring a box of tissues. You'll need them all.",

I can see that other who has given a review on this movie has claimed that the gore is very explicit but also very necessary. I just cannot agree on this. That Captain Vidal is evil itself could have been shown in much more subtle ways - and when this is done it is often much more terrifying as it makes your imagination picture what is not shown and the result is, that you picture what you yourself think is the ultimate evil.",

At first, I was skeptic toward to watch it because I thought it would be some kind of cliche fantasy movie. But I was totally wrong. Guillermo de Toro delivered a very beautiful yet tragic story. I said it is not cliche because first it is a dark fantasy with bloody scenes (I thought the movie was a happy-journey thing). And I love when the character is faced with danger there is not a suddenly-hero-come from nowhere to help him/ her. Mercedes is the character I favorite most. She is strong, brave and smart. I felt like clapping when she brutally attack the captain. Besides, I hate the main character most, Ofelia.

The Pale Man was scary to some other people in the audience who I watched this with but to me would go well in a film based purely on horror. I wouldn't recommend this to kids as it is definitely aimed at adults. Im gonna have to watch it again because as we all know it was subtitled.

515,23 July 2008,a05102267,9, The last task is for the viewer,"""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of those movies that deserved all the praise that it receives. Now imagine if a movie has the cruelty and the horror of movies as ""In Company of Wolves"", the dark beauty of Tim Burton's films and the nostalgic tone of the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has all that and more. The story could be taken literally as the way that everything that happens in the movie is real, but also could be seen as a symbol of the feelings of the characters in the hard times that they live. Ofelia, the main character is a girl that dreams with her own world of fantasy when the reality fails her miserably. And after he mets the strange faun (played wonderfully by Doug Jones, who also made a great work playing the terrifying Pale Man) she finds her hope, but also learns about all the evilness around her, the cruelty and the lack of humanity of the world that she lives, something that seems more terrifying than giant frogs or strange monsters. At the end, the faun offers her chose between her dreams and what is good. And she chooses, and then the ambiguous (and yet, somewhat hopeful) ending came. So here is a last task for the viewers of the film made by Guillermo del Toro: If that those viewers are able to accept the fantasy or if they will reject it considering that everything was in Ofelia's mind. Many theories have been mentioned in different web sites, some trying to prove that everything related with the fantasy (the faun, the fairies, the monsters and the magical kingdom) were only imagination, while others are convinced that all the events of the movie were real. However, there is nothing to prove: The film's tone is ambiguous, letting the viewers chose whatever they want according their perception of the reality. I guess that it is the message of ""Pan's Labyrinth"": how our perception of the world makes us chose our decisions, to chose between right and wrong, to chose to believe or not. It is very much like believing in the after-life, and some religious imagery shows us that this wasn't unintentional. Besides that, the film is wonderful: the direction is great, the atmosphere is very well made, the performances are incredible (Specially Sergi L√≥pez as the evil Captain Vidal, that is by more terrifying than any of the monsters of the film) This is a good example of adult fantasy, and is probably a unique movie in his genre.

I was a bit skeptical paying for a movie that wasn't in English, and having to spend the entire time reading to understand what was happening, and while it does take away from the experience somewhat, the movie is so compelling and gripping that it does little to distract you from the incredible experience. Something triggered in my brain 11 years later that made me want to see this movie again, and I just finished watching it and now that I'm older, found that I appreciated the movie even more this time around. The mixture of fantasy, magic, war, innocence, hatred, love, and the underlying good vs. evil story really are well balanced in this film. I'd have rated it a 10, other than what I mentioned earlier about having to read the subtitles which does slightly detract from the enjoyment. I read in the trivia notes that the writer/director declined a budget of 2x to make the movie in English, so I commend him for making such an amazing film and staying true to his desire to keep it original.

526,2 March 2007,abigailbfay,9," A marvelous, disturbing fairytale","Pan's Labyrinth is a very impressive film, both artistically and historically. It is fascinating to see how the worlds of fantasy and reality collide, and with what unforeseen consequences. Ofelia is an endearing character, very innocent and yet wise. She is perceptive; though she lives half the time in a world of fairies and fauns, she notices the destruction of the world around her. Though her story is compelling, and her imagination darkly fascinating, Ofelia alone did not make this movie great. Instead, what shocked and impressed me the most was the uninhibited way in which it portrayed Franco's Spain. This film is not shy when it comes to violence. If you are in the least bit squeamish when it comes to blood, this would not be a good choice! I found the violence overpowering at times, though it was not gratuitous. On the contrary, having it so present in the film forces the viewer to put themselves truly in the time period, and makes them consider the situation more in depth. It was not a happy time for Spain; death and killing were simply everywhere. The character of the sadistic Captain takes this to extremes, but it comes from all sides, and we can see the pervasive effects of this violence in young Ofelia's thoughts. The film also forced me to assess my personal character. Whenever a film is so deeply real, as this one is, that it brings the viewer into the world in which it is set, it makes me wonder: what side would I be on? In that same situation, what would I do? Am I brave enough to do what we know is right? Difficult questions to answer. For me, Pan's Labyrinth inspired such self reflection. It will blow you away, sicken you, inspire you, and leave you haunted. In all, an excellent dark fairytale that deserved every Academy Award it won.",

528,13 September 2015,ArthurFinney,9, Great movie blends fantasy and reality,"What is really great about this movie is its alternating stories. Part of the time it focuses on the army fighting the guerrillas and the other part it focuses on Ophelia trying to prove herself to be worthy of returning to the underground realm. The stories do not intertwine until the ending when even then they do not fully mix. The direction was awesome, knowing when to be mysterious, when to be exciting, and when to be tragic. The music had a creepy and mysterious tone to it, which matched the movies tone. The sets were pretty cool also. My favorite scene from the movie was Ophelia's second trial. It was really suspenseful at first and then intense and scary. I thought the pale creature's design was brilliant. The only things I thought could be improved on were that Ophelia isn't a very interesting character as she is not meant to be much more than an innocent, imaginative kid, and that I wished the story would focus a bit more on the fantasy part which I found to be more interesting than the realistic part. This is a must see if you like dark fantasy movies.",

And I don't think anyone else could have mixed the two together so well. The visual images are just stunning in every way. The mix of CGI and puppets make for the fantasy world to seem just as realistic as the real world. The acting is top-notch, especially by the little girl, Ivana Baquero, and the brutal, evil military captain, played by Sergi Lopez. The strongest part, though, is del Toro's storytelling ability as he flawlessly takes us between parallel worlds until they collide together in unspeakable terms. Be warned, this is not for children or anyone squeamish to violence in any way. There are multiple scenes of graphic violent behavior, yet it all is completely necessary to show how evil the real world can actually be. The ending may disappoint some viewers, but after pondering it for awhile, I found it to be the right choice, as well as truly beautiful and moving. This is truly a tour de force movie, mixing multiple genres into its blend and bringing out something truly magnificent.

It is a fantasy/fairy tale drama set during the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War at the end of world war 2. The central character is a little girl played by the subtle Ivana Baquero, but it is not a kids film. It is very violent and is bereft of ANY compassion. What is gained from all the violence is a strong metaphorical answer towards the 'real world' and the 'fantasy world' which the lead character is slowly led into. The films central explorations are hope, redemption, sacrifice, faith, fate and what answers lie beyond life itself. Yet, it is not an escape into a fantasy world.",

Ofelia is tasked by a faun to carry our several types of errands so that she can be with her family from the underworld. Meanwhile Captain Vidal is killing everyone from the doctor to the rabbit hunters. He even killed the rabbit hunters with a beer bottle. That is actually pretty impressive. Vidal's views are Type A personality style. He is stern with his soldiers and has a form of Hitler mentality. The ideology of this film is basically from Captain Vidal wanting a better Spain. And he will stop at nothing to achieve his goal. This film is an intense film for anyone to watch. From Vidal killing everyone in his way to his cheek being slashed open.

546,16 February 2007,johno-21,7, Alice in Francoland,"The story is set in 1944 in Spain after General Franco's forces have taken over the country following the Spanish civil war. Captain Vidal (Sergi L√≥pez) is a brutal, sadistic commander of a garrison of soldiers that has commandeered an old estate in the mountains of northern Spain that serves as a headquarters to fight rebel guerrillas and as a supply depot for local villagers to get rationed food. Vidal has sent for his pregnant new wife Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to join him against her doctor's advice because Vidal believes he should be present went the child is born and is determined it will be a boy. Carmen had been a widow and has a 12 year old daughter Ofelia (Ivana Baquero). Ofelia is a bookish girl who loves reading and making up fantasy stories. Upon her arrival she discovers a stone and instinct draws her to an ancient stone monument in the forest and she replaces the stone to where it once belonged. This sets the stage of the world of the labyrinth that she will become an integral part of to preserve it's existence. This film is receiving rave reviews from critics and film goers world wide and has been nominated for six Academy Awards in Art Direction, Cinematography, Make Up, Original Score, Original Screenplay and Best Foreign Languge Film. This is the odds-on favorite as best foreign film and could also win an Oscar for art direction and make up. Guillermo de Toro wrote the screenplay from his own story and directs this dark, gloomy blend of fantasy and reality that is also extremely violent. The story is imaginative but fairly weak and full of holes, flaws and inconsistencies. Vidal is so perpetually scary and one dimensionally sinister and sadistic with not even a false or pretentious good side to give the character the element of unknown surprise that would make for superb movie villain. Although Carmen is a central character because of her importance to the story, she is almost incidental. Mercedes (Maribel Verd√∫) is the housekeeper in charge of the estate staff and has a brother who is one of the rebel guerrillas. Verd√∫ probably provides the best acting in this cast. √Ålex Angulo is Dr. Ferreiro, Carmen's doctor who is also sympathetic with the rebels in a good supporting role. Doug Jones in makeup and costume plays the dual role of Pan the satyr who dwells in the ancient labyrinth that has three tasks for Ofelia to perform and of the Pale Man, one of the creepiest creatures to haunt a silver screen in some time. Pablo Adan provides the theatrical commanding voice of Pan in one of the great voice-overs of film since James Earl Jones' interpretation of Darth Vader. Del Toro has woven a Tim Burtoneque film here but this would work better as a fantasy film with less violence. I felt the film unraveled at the end and I didn't buy it's ending. I would like to see more from director del Toro but maybe less Brothers Grimm and Lewis Carroll in influence. If you want to do a war film do a war film. If you want to do a fantasy film do a fantasy film. Some images in this film are overstressed as if to say pay attention because this is going to play a key role later on. Okay, okay I get it. Get on with it. Because of gratuitous, disturbing graphic violence I would not recommend this to anyone. I don't see the cinematic achievement that warrants the praise this film is getting. It has a lot going for it but it's not a great film. I would give this 7.5 out of 10.",

This film has Del Toro's masterpiece written all over it and truly is one of his finest if not best films to date. The story is set in Spain's war torn past and has a focus of a 12 year old girl named Ofelia who seems to live in a dream world of her own which probably seems to be the best thing for as her reality is far from perfect with her mother forced to travel whilst being pregnant to meet her new husband and Ofelia's step-father the brutal and cold Captin Vidal who as we get to see is far, far from the perfect role model for any child. As the events unfold you are taken into a surreal world with extraordinary creatures and you begin to wonder what is real and what not. Del Toro has done such a marvellous job of luring you into this little girls world and taking you to a place where the lines of fantasy and reality become blurred . There are great performance's all round especially to the girl who played Ofelia and Sergi Lopez the cold hearted , evil Captin Vidal . Pans Labrinyth is truly a wonderful film to have watched, experienced, and felt my only complaint was that it left us too soon as your taking into this captivating world which tells us a very in your face fairy tale without the 'cuteness' which I feel is not suitable for children but on the hand tells us that indeed the Power of innocence is something evil should fear.

This story of love really feels authentic and wonderful, mostly because it is a story about love of family. You can honestly appreciate the way the story is framed in warn torn Spain and how that creates a different level of drama and sometimes confusion.

Now, I usually hate bloody and gory films, but I heard that this was a different kind of movie and I decided to watch it. I'm very impressed! Guillermo Del Toro really created a masterpiece with this movie about the innocence of a young child, who is thrown in the brutality of war, and even though I'm German, I think this should have won the Foreign Picture Oscar instead of The Lives of Others. The plot brilliantly weaves two stories together in one, obscuring reality and imagination until we forget which one is which. The young girl Ofelia and her pregnant mother arrive at the small military base of her stepfather Captain Vidal who is in charge of killing the rebells in the mountains of Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Vidal is a sadistic and dominant soldier, who is extremely strict with everyone and uses extreme brutality to get things done.

It had magic, violence, history, gore, family issues, war, and loyalty. It helped that the Spanish speakers spoke clearly and slowly so if I missed a caption I could still figure out what was going on. (My Spanish is pretty simple). The imagery and imagination of the fairy world were Oscar worthy. The fairies and faun were great special effects/costumes and the violent captain was very believable and scary as an out of control military man in a nasty civil war.

Ofelia and her pregnant mother travel to the country within the war in 1944 and under the guidance of a ruthless captain. He is not Ofelia's father but he demands that the unborn child be male. Ofelia reads fairy tales and is eventually guided by a fairy to a portal where she is given a quest that must be completed before the next full moon. She encounters giant toads, strange creatures, and fauns that all add to the film's extraordinary visual presentation. Directed by Guillermo del Toro with an exquisite visual spectacular. The ending is dark and aimed at the wrong audience. Ivana Baquero is fetching as Ofelia whose imagination is her escape from the harsh realities. Sergi Lopez plays the sadistic Captain whose last scene has him challenged with the news that his son will never know him. Ariadna Gil plays Ofelia's mother, and Maribel Verdu plays a servant whose brother leads troops in the forest. Doug Jones plays a grotesque monster called the Pale Man, who has a taste for children and genuine fright. This all adds to hope and that there are those pushing for freedom despite its rare placement. All this themed with the imagination, which can be one's only escape. Score: 8 / 10",

However, given its decision to evade the meaning and methods of its own madness, or without offering more explicit explanations for connecting the two contrasting genres outside of escapism, is it still effective? Or is it just a badass movie? And is this okay anyway? It's like that Metallica album ""S&M"" that was recorded live with the San Francisco Symphony... you want to like it, but do you really?",
576,6 February 2007,mgcman-1,9, A Goyaesque vision of Spain,"At the end of the 18th century, Spanish artist Goya produced an artistic masterpiece ""el sue√±o de la razon produce monstrous - the dream of reason creates monsters"". Del Toros' recent film is a modern version of the same theme. As in Goya's time when Spain was rocked by the Napoleonic invasion, the setting of Pan's Labyrinth during the time of Spain's civil war serves to remind the viewer that society is very fragile and subject to radical change through brute force. In the new Spain, where might makes right, innocence is lost, and people's lives are sacrificed in order to make way for a painful vision of Spain's fascist future, a girl creates an alternative fantasy world in order to cope with the trauma that is her life. Nevertheless the monsters of her dreams provide little escape from the brutes that she must deal with every day. Trust, power, loyalty, secrets, all are vividly represented by the actors in this, one of the best films of 2006.",

She is drawn to a labyrinth near the mill by a 'faerie', and it is there she is introduced to the Faun (also known as 'Pan' in the English adaption, but the faun introduces himself as 'Faun'.

I found the parallels between the real word and the fantasy world very subtle, but effective nonetheless.

'Pan's Labyrinth (2006)' provides a surprisingly brutal stark contrast to the sense of wide-eyed wonder we feel whenever the lead steps into her newfound world of fawns and fairies, a world which isn't actually all that much safer. The tangibility of both these aspects is commendable considering one was created from scratch and the other was recreated from a war-torn era over fifty years ago. It is the believability of the world that makes the stakes seem all the more real, considering that danger is almost constantly present even in the places where the protagonist goes to escape - or seek a remedy for - her real-life woes. This is a layered, magical and mature piece that almost demands dissection. It's affecting, engaging and enjoyable. 9/10",

It is set in Fascist Spain in 1944 and General Vidal is fighting against a group of rebels hiding out in the forest surround his headquarters. It is a brutal setting for anyone, especially young Ofelia. In order to cope, Ofelia finds escape in her fairy tales. It becomes a reality when she meets the Faun, who tells her that she is the reincarnation of a princess who died many years ago.

This is very audacious as it's combining a fantasy world populated with dream like creatures with a brutal real world where war and violence reign supreme. This is a bold movie, and maybe that's why people raved about it since it works partially. For me, it just didn't click. It's a very mixed bag and while not an enjoyable film it has some strong qualities that belong in a better movie. The acting, even from the child lead, is very strong and the film has one of the nastiest villains of the 21st century. It's an interesting idea and there are occasions where a mysterious power shakes itself to life. The death of Ofelia at the end is pretty shocking and some bits, such as when she first enters the labyrinth, are well done. The acting makes the movie, and it's difficult not to admire such a bold hybrid of 2 very different genres.",

It took me three times to watch it and analyze it as a film. The mesmerizing beauty of the movie impede me to actually critique the editing, acting and so forth the first time I saw the movie. Although the film is too dark at times, it is just a little blemish in what is otherwise a gorgeous face. Pan's Labyrinth is a simple vessel that hides complex issues. Del Toro delivers a deliberate masterpiece where no stroke is unintentional. It might seem as if the characters are hammered into a position. The army is evil and the mother is shallow. Still, part of their nuances are shown. The Captain self hatred is shown when he slice the throat of his image on the mirror. The mother selfishness is an attempt for survival and maybe part of her disillusion. Whether Ofelia is truly a princes is also a question Del Toro gives to the viewer. If you are more like Ofelia, you will believe she is a princes. If you are like Mercedes, you don't believe but you allow others to be whatever they want.

A child's fantasy that should not be seen by children, and only adults can handle watching, if that.

There she is met by a mythical creature called Pan. There she embarks a weird and wonderful journey, having to complete three tasks for Pan. You meet some scary and spectacular creatures and the special effects are glorious. Even though it is in subtitles do not be put off. Even i was put off when i saw on the DVD box that it was in subtitles but i took the risk and bought it and i think it's the best thing i have ever done. This film is for adults and definitely not for small children! It's not your average fairy tale! It's one with violence,death and lots more adult things!

612,13 February 2023,CinemaSerf,7, Pan's Labyrinth,"I think this is my favourite film, as yet, from Guillermo del Toro - and it gets better the more you watch it. Set against at backdrop of a Spain still trying to recover from it's civil war, the young ""Ofelia"" and her pregnant mother ""Carmen"" are sent to live with the rather brutish ""Capt. Vidal"". Now he is a singularly nasty piece of work and the girl longs to meet her own real father. It's in the middle of the night that ""Ofelia"" encounters a sprite who offers her some hope. It knows of a faun in the middle of a maze who might be able to help, and so they set of in search of this ostensibly sagely and benign creature. The meeting offers her far more than a glimmer, she need only complete three tasks and will find herself taking up her inheritance as a princess and reunited with her kingly father. What now ensues is a fairy tale full of dark magic and untrustworthy characters whom the young girl must face if she is to succeed. Given the atrocities being carried out in the real world around her, she seeks more and more solace in this nether world that is probably just as dangerous - it certainly has it's fair share of malevolence and duplicity - but with her father the ultimate goal, she perseveres with wisdom and gritty determination. What makes this work is the delicious permutations of evil it offers. Contrasting the real with the fabled, the human with the fantasy - and the decency the young girl epitomises is by no means certain of success. The visual effects cleverly integrate both of her worlds without dominating the look of the film or the potency of the story - one of love, ambition, fear, trickery. It's creatively exciting and captivating too. This is storytelling at it's best, and on a big screen can be appreciate to it's full - and dazzling - effect.",

The amount of violence shown is not particularly great but what is shown is brutal. For the majority, it is the sense that the villains are capable of such hateful and inhumane acts that you fear what they will do next.

The mix of brutal Reality and beautiful Fantasy has never been done better, though the historical horror overshadows (and eventually consumes) the imaginary world that del Toro creates. When Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen arrive at their new home with the sadistic Capatain Vidal in 1944 Spain, the stage is set for the fantasy that follows. The ever slow-moving camera watches scenes play out in an almost dream-like manner, drifting in and out and around the players the entire time. I've always liked this approach to cinematography: it helps make even static scenes tolerable. When the fascists begin to round up and torture and kill some of the ""rebels,"" del Toro contrasts these horrors with the mundane, everyday indifference of the world around them: the forest itself is undisturbed by the wanton murders. Ofelia follows a fairy into an underground world where she meets a faun. ""You're going to a very dangerous place,"" he warns her. Unfortunately, she doesn't heed the warning, and... well, see for yourself what happens next.",

After the untimely death of her father and pregnancy of her mother, Ofelia goes with her mother to live with The Captain, an indescribably cruel, cold and calculating Captain of the Spanish army. Because of stress related to the move and her mother's pregnancy, Ofelia creates a fantasy world in her mind which has her believe to be an immortal princess separated from her real father at birth who lives in the secret underground world which houses a large variety of immortal fairy tale creatures. The most prominent of these creatures is Faun, a tall wide-eyed monster, who looks like the illegitimate love child of a tree and one of the aliens from the movie 'Signs'. Faun gives her difficult three tasks to complete, in order for her to be accepted into the supernatural underground realm she was supposedly spawned from. During the course of the movie Ophelia must complete these tasks and survive her harsh reality with her sadistic abusive step-father, the Captain.",

I've now seen this a handful of times, with two of them in the theater, which is an experience in of itself.

I prepared myself for a beautifully done fantasy movie (judging from the trailers and the awards) and instead... instead I had a few scenes of fantasy in the context of a pseudo-historical Z movie, with trashy violence (that I found completely non functional to the story) and psychologically inconsistent characters. The movie looses tracks so many times you start thinking you are watching something that has not yet gone through a serious cut. Yes, you will notice a lot of post-production, but what about the cohesion and the necessity of the different scenes... do they hold? Ajajaj Gullermo Del Toro... what did you want to do with this movie? Why couldn't you choose a theme? You ended up making a weak hybrid that does not convince either the fans of splatter nor the fans of fantasy movies.",

Sergi L√≥pez plays Carmen Vidal a powerful captain given the task of riding the hills of the Spanish republicans, an unforgettable performance by Ivana Baquero as Ofelia, a young girl trapped in a world of torture and war.

646,26 October 2006,Im_your_Papi,10, Best Del Toro film to date,"As of last night this movie more than surprised me, not only in content, but acting. The primary actors were just too good to be true. One of Del Toro's earlier projects was El Espinazo del Diablo 'The Devil's Backbone' and I though of it as too good. Del Toro's imagination is macabre to the extreme, but not evil macabre like George Romero. The most sadistic character so far is Sergi Lopez portrayal of Captain Vidal, set in 1944 in which Franco's soldiers were fighting to finally push back any rebels against Franco's evil regime Vidal was one of the most sadistic bastards on screen, ihated him so much for being cruel, twisted and perverse. Other portrayals was a young lady Ivana Baquero, the movie primarily revolves around her and her imagination of fairies and fauns and nasty creatures. Her portrayal of Ofelia was second to none for an actress under 17 and amongst some of the best acting. I will not say the movie was gory, but there are scenes of torture, sick and twisted visual effects, violence involving minors, apathy in the part of Vidal for his wife, and pure casualties of war of both guilty and innocent parties whether directly involved with the revolution or just innocent bystanders. The Faun let's say, will give you a mixed feeling and reaction to his true intents. But the best part of the movies involves a self sacrifice, that will give me a rating of this movie a ""10"".",

652,4 March 2014,bhanu2293,10, One of the best fantasy films that i have seen.,"I am a huge fantasy aficionado. Films like Blancanieves, LOTR series and Miyazaki's works are my personal favorites. I knew that Del Toro was a fine film-maker when it came to telling a dark fantasy story. So, when the credits started rolling, i knew that i had seen one of the best films of all time. The real beauty lies in the fact that Del Toro manages to blend Spanish civil war and a beautifully lavish fantasy world together. The film is brutal yet magical. This is a fairy-tale for grown ups where Ofelia's child-like imagination runs free yet the world created by her is full of horror. As far as acting goes it is Sergi L√≥pez's fantastic portrayal of Vidal that caught my eye. His performance is chilling enough to make you hate the captain. Ivana Baquero portrays Ofelia with a nuance which is beyond her years. And lastly it is Guillermo Navarro's masterful cinematography that breathes life in every scene. A true masterpiece which is sure to remain a high benchmark for fantasy films in years to come.",

Though admittedly the actors and actresses didn't compellingly excel much with their roles, the story was nevertheless full of substance and depth. I believe that the acting wasn't terrible, it fairly fit the storyline. And they excelled well in special effects, cinematography and art, which balances well the structure of the story as a whole. The uniqueness of the story has also something to do why it is undeniably captivating. We were used to children fantasy stories filled with immense fictitious characters, places and most of all happy endings. Though in history some of these historical children fantasy tales had depressing portions of the story, the clich√© is that it ended happily ever after. However this film is an exception. I can't even believe that everything about the story where pulled out of Guillermo Del Toro's imaginative mind. To tell story in the end was saddening. I didn't end happily well, as what majority of us would expect. This isn't really a new treat for most films. But for this film¬Öin this area of genre it is brilliantly portrayed. The depth of the words, the poetic structure of the narration got me enthralled, and I would say this is undoubtedly a magnificent film. It's dark, magical, sad but eerily captivating.",

Ofelia is a 13 years old girl that is leaving her childhood and experimenting her last opportunity before the doors of the realm of fantasy will be closed forever but before that happens Ofelia must pass some tests like get a key and steal a dagger to discover a forgotten world.

Based on some of the reviews I have read on here there are a few doubters, but personally and speaking as a fan of magical realism, fantasy, myth, and faerie story I can say that my fears were unfounded and my senses were mesmerised. This film is what cinema is all about because it brings to life a very well written script before your eyes and will leave you thinking and feeling the film for a great deal of time after it is finished. The effects shots in particular are incredible with an array of monsters and shadowy sets that leave the viewer breathless before even a word is uttered. I have not until this point considered watching many of the films of Del Toro, but following this I feel compelled to look at his career with closer scrutiny.",

Still, the historical backdrop is unique, the creature and environment design (if not the CG) feel as fresh as a daisy and the violence is... unremittingly realistic in a way that sharpens the edges of this thing into razor points.

I've noticed so many people calling it a superb and spectacular fantasy, what makes it such a great fantasy? is it the guy with eyes in his hands? the big frog? or the faun and his fairies? because those are the only fantasy elements in this movie, plus I don't understand why the faun would give her a second chance at immortality after she eats the food off that creepy thing's table, I feel it was just the failed attempt to add suspense and to integrate why that thing would chase after her.

I went to it fearing disappointment because of all the superlatives I'd heard applied to it beforehand, but it knocked me over! Visually and as great storytelling, del Toro has really done it! What a wonderful adventure on so many levels, full of charm, horror, deep sadness, tragedy, and abundant life! The Captain is both hatefully evil and fascinating at once. The little girl is heartrending in her courage, imagination, discernment of character, and persistence in doing what her heart knows is right, regardless of what Pan or her stepfather tells her. Surely, if ""Life is beautiful"" can take an American academy award nomination for best picture, this film is equally deserving, both for its craftsmanship and its gift of hope and courage in the face of the general brutality of the human condition, rather than merely being recognized in the ""foreign"" category. I won't burden you at length with my frustrations over the academy's tendencies lately (that is, its snobbishly unfair backlash that has besotted it ever since the 3 years it was forced to ""endure"" the onslaught of Peter Jackson and his unfashionably epic Tolkien films!) but this is just another symptom of what's wrong with the academy lately.

694,19 December 2006,raminsabi,10, The Best Film of the Year,"When going to see Pan's Labyrinth, I had already been told by critics it was the best film of the year, yet by the look of the plot, I found it hard to believe them. But from the beginning of the film, it is easy to see why it is regarded so highly. The true brilliance of the film is the emotions portrayed by the main characters, especially the young Ivana Baquero as the lead of Ofelia, that creates empathy and caring for the characters and the story, as well as Sergi Lopez as the ruthless Captain Vidal, who plays one of the most convincing, terrifying and most realistic villains I've ever seen in a film. The story is in itself a magnificent labyrinth, going places a Hollywood movie wouldn't dare. The film is beautiful in every way, from the cinematography and impressive visual effects that could rival big Hollywood studios, to the symbolism in the parallels of the fantasy and reality, to the raw yet subtle emotions portrayed. Pan's Labyrinth has its unique elements because it is the only film that has ever been able to mix a serious drama with fantasy successfully. It has a big enough budget with great production values to impress, but it has the sheer originality of an independent film reeking of genius. This is a true masterpiece that can easily withstand time, as it contains everything a masterpiece needs, and should be seen by all.",

The reviews (ones on this site) led me to believe that it would be brilliant. I think i must have watched the wrong film because I found nothing of the sort. It was boring and had no plot. Also, they had tried to paste together two completely different types of film with sleep-inducing consequences. The film contains a small amount of violence which, given its graphical nature, I would rather have done without. How this film managed not to get an 18 classification based on that I don't know. I kept wondering if the film was leading somewhere but it never did. It yields a couple of small parts that are quite good (thats why I gave it a 2) but a minute or two later we get back to boredom. The only reason I wrote this review is that I find it unfathomable how it averaged an 8.3 rating. Stay home because there's nothing good about this film. Even the usher was keeling over.",

Del Toro takes what on the surface (or in the hands of another director) could be a simple child's fairy tale, and gives it extraordinary depth. Every character is fully drawn, especially the central character around whom the story swirls. The story is so compelling that even without the fantasy elements, I would have been gripped to my seat. But the fantasy elements take the visuals to a whole other level and plunge the viewer into a world that is like none other you've ever experienced.

722,23 June 2007,jvincent1,6, Am I Missing Something Here?,"Given the present sorry state of American cinema, I was somewhat cynical of a film as heralded as this one. After all, what had Guillermo del Toro done to enhance his reputation as a filmmaker other than Blade II, and Hellboy? I've seen better resumes from young directors. So, what do we get from him in Pan's Labrynth? A magical war movie set during the revolt against Spain's Generalisimo Franco. Guys, I'm still waiting for the day when CGI becomes so good that it can replace the need for a good story. That del Toro is a product of the CGI-dominated school of film-making is very evident here, as the truly wondrous special effects taking place below the earth seemingly have little to do with the world above. There, the evil Captain brutalizes, tortures and kills peasants by the dozens, and we get to watch every excruciating minute of it. I even wanted to cheer when he finally ""got"" his in the end; one shot to the head. And, how does the magical world below help bring about the demise of the captain? Oh, it doesn't. This fantastic world of visual horrors but mostly delights, is strictly for the benefit of poor little Ofelia (and, surprise, surprise, there's her mother, another victim of the captain). The inhabitants of this netherworld enable us to appreciate the value of old time effects such as make-up, but it's still effects, effects, effects. Except for topside, where its murder, torture, more murder (we even get to see the captain perform a little stitch job on the side of his mouth). The more I write, the worse this movie gets, so I'll end it here by saying if you want to see a filmmaker combine plot with imaginative special effects feast your eyes on a Terry Gilliam film, particularly his Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. If only he could reign it in just a little.",

726,25 February 2007,naun,6, A dissenting view,"By interweaving the brutal reality of fascist Spain with a child's fantasy world, the filmmakers evidently hoped to say something deep about evil. Undoubtedly the juxtaposition of the two worlds is done with considerable guile, both in the transitions and in the visual echoes between them. The problem is that the film begins with a portrayal of evil, in its realistic scenes, that is so trite that the fantasy sequences have nothing of substance to elaborate upon, and end up being merely sentimental. Del Toro appears to equate evil with mere sadism, taking computer-enhanced violence as a shortcut to presumed moral insight. The characters who populate the tale ‚Äì the despicable captain, the heroic resistance fighters, the compassionate doctor ‚Äì are the flimsiest of stock figures. This weekend I saw Louis Malle's Au Revoir les Enfants, where evil is a mysterious force that indelibly marks the rites of youth. That film attains a kind of terrible moral sobriety that is not to be found here.

""Is the juice worth the squeeze?""","We have layers of ideas here in multiple stories... a girls fighting against hope gets a chance for a better life in the kingdom she belongs, but the mythology that is required to follow falls short of being worthy. It's creepy in its' imaginary monsters and scary in its real fascist war monsters. Of course, they are one in the same in reality, just evil that can not be satiated. We have the actual story of rebels making a last stand while hiding in the woods. That story seems made for TV with small scope productions,black and white characters, dialog made for dummies (I mean, what person who is deathly concerned for a sibling greets him by saying ""Brother""?) Director and writer Guillermodel Torro took on too much and it shows. The way the Captain turns on his pregnant wife right in front of the daughter is just too deliberate, so that we would know how little El Capitan thought of her. The rebel mole, played by the chief woman on the compound, gives her speech about getting away with what she did because she was invisible to him? C'Mon... is this Telemundo TV? The lack of real fear and amazement in the little girl is understandable but detracts from a suspension of disbelief. Then there is the story of the ""worthy soul"", life after death, and deliverance of the princess to the King by the Faun. If the soul was worthy, why need to prove herself? Our narrator, as he explains almost everything related to the mythology, The Faun, is sometimes looking like the hind legs of the creature and at others, he seems to just be standing awkwardly. Again, Guiermo, I'm paying attention! Don't treat me like a kid who won't figure it out. This is not a kids' movie in any way shape or form.

If I had seen it at the theatre I would have walked out protesting but I made the big regret and I bought this movie and so far the fantasy part is OK but the rest is nothing but lies and miss-truths I think Mr Del Toro should stick to films that are fantasy and have no historical links as he has messed this one up by making the Reds look like the liberators when Franco and his troop save Spain from being another Russia and torn apart....

739,27 March 2019,tesswysko,8, SO HAPPY I decided to watch this again!,"Years ago when this movie first came out, I decided to watch it because of all the hype. But back then, I did not have subtitle capability and while I speak Spanish I do not speak Spain Spanish I speak Mexican Spanish and yes there is a difference. So it was hard to follow and get a lot out of it. And over the years my memories of the movie were tainted and that I didn't get to truly enjoy the movie because I was constantly trying to understand what people were saying because they were talking so fast and it didn't seem like there was that much enjoyable in the story line and I was so caught up in the militaristic portions of it.
But when I saw that this movie was on Netflix, I decided to give it a chance and sure enough I had the ability to use subtitles and it didn't detract that much from enjoying the story. So if you're going to watch this I truly recommend you do so with subtitles on. Otherwise you're going to go nuts trying to figure out who's who and what's going on in the story line.
This movie is a true gem if you enjoy immense cinematography and beautiful orchestration. Myself being a person who likes to delve into movies, especially anything that is fantasy and reminds me of all the books that I read growing up to escape, I liked it fully delve into a movie and if the cinematography/ locations and the proper scoring all the films Ambiance is done, you can't help but jump into the deep end and not want to leave! The acting was top-notch! These actors are just amazing and I know it had to help having Guillermo del Toro at the wheel! More on him in a minute. The person in charge of doing the period Costumes was just fantastic! The effects people in charge of not only the Faun, which we know from Greek mythology as Pan, but also the sightless monster, did an amazing job but those characters but quite honestly Pan what's my favorite! He looked every bit the part of a Druidic Faun! So everyone who worked putting this movie together was fantastic! I know the bits and pieces of the real world were very important to character motivation, but for as long as this movie was, I think I would have enjoyed more of the fantasy world and less of the military drudgery and evilness of the Captain's world.
So I've always been a huge comic book fan going back to the 80s when I first got my Chrystar comic book at a garage sale with my grandmother and I cherished it! Then I got back into it in the early 90s when the guy I've been dating for years turn me back on the comic books and what a way to go I ended up with loads of comic books! One of those being Hellboy! I'd heard that a man named Guillermo del Toro was doing a Hellboy movie and I was very concerned because a lot of these comic book movies were just awful! But then I had heard that he had done Pan's Labyrinth, and I checked that out to see what kind of chops he brings to the table. I'm in music industry executive and I deal with bands but in many ways are two different worlds are quite similar. So I wanted to see his qualifications and how good he was. Well like I said earlier it was not easy for me to watch because of all the Spanish going on but I did enjoy what I saw I was not super impressed I was kind of bored because of all the military stuff going on but I thought okay let's see where this goes. But when Hellboy came out, it was completely different from Pan's Labyrinth and it was just funny and explosively full of action and just amazing so he certainly did not let me down!

However, the film is not without serious faults, which in my opinion is it's very obvious pro-leftist take on the Spanish civil war. Instead of being objective on matters political, the film sets out to portray the leftists and communists as romantic freedom fighters, and the other side (supporters of Franco, the Catholic Church, the military) as companions in evil. As anyone who knows about the history of Spain will till you, things were far less clear cut than that and atrocities were carried out on both sides.

752,20 March 2007,pepenet23,10, A story about Spain,"Some Mexicans, only some are as well versed in Spanish history as Americans are on British history; usually those of us whose grandparents were Spanish and lived that period of time in Spain. I don't know much about the director's relation to Spain, and he might even rebuttal my interpretation on his work. What I see in this fairy tale is the recent history of a country that went through a most traumatic period in time. The Spanish civil war lasted from 1936 to 1939 (a brutal prelude of what WWII was to be like). This came after of almost a century of continuous downfall from what was once the most powerful empire for almost 300 years. Napoleon's occupation of the peninsula, the loss of its colonies, the Spanish American war, were more calamities its pride could take. Through disappointment of its traditional institutions ¬ñMonarchy, Church and Military- many hasten the country to radical swift changes towards the left. This caused the right to react with overwhelming violence. Franco's Nationalists after defeating the Republican side ¬ñcomposed of democrats, socialists, communists, laics, etc.- wisely kept his distance to his old Axis friends during the World War but convinced allied victors he wound be a useful ally against the communist during the coming cold war, the nationalists survived as a regime until the death of the generalissimo in 1975. A process of democratization was begun under King Juan Carlos I. Back to our story the princess is attracted to a new light and world, like Spain is to the 20th century modern dogmas promises of a better society. But the brightness blinds her and she forgets who she really is. The war has blinded Spaniards and they've forgotten the fact they are brothers & sisters. The emotionless scenes where both sides make sure fallen enemies are truly dead by shooting them again and not taking prisoners, if only to torture them, states the sort of hatred the country has fallen into. It is wishful thinking that a rebel group would actually defeat a government force. One cannot see this as a reality fact but a metaphoric result of what will come eventually to Spain. Liberty and democracy will return, but it's not the freedom fighters who will do this, they were actually defeated or migrated elsewhere, but Captain Vidal surrendering his son to the freedom defenders hints us what truly comes to happened, it's the children of the phalanges who restore democracy in the end when Franco died. They brought back the wishes of their fathers' enemies, a fairer and more just society. The return of Ofelia (Spain) to her kingdom can only occur with her death first. Mercedes morning for Ofelia, indicates that a unbearably long while will pass by. All who fought would have died before the new blood can rebuild the realm. The young offspring must not know if their fathers where nationalist or republicans for the future to work for them. Middle East hatred has endured because Jews, Muslims and even Christians know very well who they are. Ofelia's refusal to sacrifice her brother is Spain's hope in the future even if that means it will have to endure uncertain fate and the cruelty of the fascists and even death. Death is pretty much present in this story because a fact is so many did die, to many, to a point where it's death that taught everyone a better way had to be found. A lesson many learned but many forgot. If ever the return of a King Arthur, a Flower of Scotland, a Quetzalcoatl happened to someone it turned true for Spain.",

757,1 February 2007,bingham_bryant,8, A stunning reminder of the harshness of childhood...,"There is no one more creative than a child in the dark. As children, almost all of us were overcome by the most macabre leaps of the imagination once our parents had left us alone in our beds, vulnerable and scared. Suddenly every sound was a death threat, every shifting beam from the street transformed into the glare of a burglar's flashlight. Logic was swiftly made malleable; the most bizarre events could be thrown together by youthful paranoia to explain the circumstances by which a mummy could be lurking in the closet, a decaying skeleton under the bed. It was all terrifying, and for a child whose mind was still unadulterated by reason, it was all very real. Guillermo del Toro's new film ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of the best movies to come along in a while for many reasons, but it is most unique in the way it has perfectly captured the terrors of childhood, both real and imaginary. ""Pan"", like del Toro's previous gem ""The Devil's Backbone"", takes place against the backdrop of 1930's Spain during the country's civil war between Fascists and Soviets that had torn it apart, The main storyline revolves around Ofelia, played by a luminescent Ivana Baquero, a young girl who has retreated into novels and fairy tales to escape the harsh realities of her life. Her mother, a widow, is heavily pregnant with the child of Capit√°n Vidal, the deliciously malignant Sergi L√≥pez, a fascist officer stationed at a dilapidated mill deep in the Soviet occupied Spanish forests. At Vidal's insistence Ofelia and her mother move there, a difficult journey and a heavy blow to the health of the weakened pregnant woman. Ofelia soon finds that she is anything but alone at the mill. Woken in the night by a noisy but amiable praying mantis, she follows the bug to a nearby labyrinth. At the maze's center she meets a faun, who soon sets her off on a series of tasks in order to escape the nightmares of her life. The quest she begins soon after is populated by creatures so freakish, so bizarre and yet simultaneously so familiar that only the mind of a child could have created them. The faun is a duplicitous, creaking old goat whose every movement is echoed by the sound of a branch breaking in the dark or the creak of a door in the night. A monstrous toad living in the bottom of an old oak encapsulates everything that is so paradoxically intriguing and repulsive about amphibians to little boys. The Pale Man, a cannibalistic monstrosity of skin and sinew, is lifted straight from Goya's painting of Saturn devouring his children, another work of art created in a mind tortured by the cruelty of the Spanish Civil War. Del Toro's monsters embody everything that is terrifying to children, brought to life so well that they are almost intolerable even in maturity. This is not a film for the squeamish, filled as it is with images of both horrific fantasy and blood which is all too real. Most of this blood is spilt by Capit√°n Vidal, whose tyranny is the focus of the film's other plot line. His dogged pursuit of the Communist forces is hampered by a rebellious but motherly housekeeper, played in a remarkable transformation by Maribel Verd√∫, the sexy older woman from ""Y tu mam√° tambi√©n"". Grimly set on the eradication and cleansing of Spain, his character gives the film important historical context, foreshadowing the beginning of Europe's own waking nightmare. Del Toro is thankfully not blunt enough to make the two plot lines parallel, instead allowing the audience to draw connections without hitting them over the head with them. About to lose her mother in childbirth, surrounded by death and the burgeoning forces of fascism, Ofelia's innocence brings into stark relief the fallen world of adults which lies around her. Del Toro has created a film which rings true because of the purity of it's' core, just a sad little girl whose dreams are being corrupted by the cruelty of her world. To bring the brutality of that world to us del Toro has resurrected our childhood nightmares, and they are more harrowing than we can ever remember.",
758,26 January 2007,stale-1,9, darkly interesting,"I must say I am a fan of Guillermo del Toro's work and was therefore surprised and joyed to find this films dark themes a refreshing approach to that of his last couple of films. I had read a lot on the production of this film and understood it was set in a dark time but was strangely still expecting an almost Jim Henson labyrinth style movie, what a shock i received when i was thrust into a very realistic world and one of the most confronting personal war dramas i have seen since Ondrej Trojan's 2003 film Zelery. My partner has a low tolerance for the depiction of brutality on screen and found some elements of this film hard to watch. so i guess a word of warning not to watch this film mistakenly with kids as some of it would leave them squirming for months. all in all a fantastic watch and an amazing achievement in cross genre writing",

Anyway the result of friends Alfonso Cuaron and Guilhermo del Toro seems to work well and I personally think that they should work again in the Future.

765,1 February 2007,radu-balanescu,8, Violent but so moralizing,"I don't understand the modern tendencies of impressing the viewer with straightforward violence. On the other hand this picture gives us a very good reason for all the blood shed in front of the audience. It's been some time since a character has given me such disgust as Capitan Vidal does. And if it hadn't been for the visual depiction of his horrific acts probably he would have remained anonymous among other bad guys. We have to admit that many of his actions are predictable and from the start you learn what to expect from him. What is great about him is the fact that he lacks all the drama that surrounds the bad characters in a classic Hollywood movie. If he has to torture someone or kill him, he just does it, he doesn't feel the need to explain himself or prepare the audience for the grand finale. This makes it very realistic and the tragedy is emphasized even more by this sadistic and cruel plain depiction.",

Anyway it seems to me now that i'm a fanatic of these kind of movies, that the context of a real world can make us more and more imaginative, beyond the things we believe and thought. For me this is a weird but beautiful example of the power of imagination that the director Del Toro can give us. I didn't remember what exactly did I do when movie finished, i just smiled, watched the credits scrolling, heard the beautiful music and then i put the movie on its box. Nothing else. Something happened. I can't describe that effect that Pan's Labyrinth gave me to me, but it was beautiful. Cry or smile, or cry while smiling. Only a genius could make that piece of cinematographic art. I liked for many reasons. One of them, it's spoken in Spanish, the atmosphere of tension that comes together when the war combined with a strong Spanish accent gives emotion to the movie. And then, the tranquility. All the actors getting deep into his character. A combined rhythm that shows different contexts of two different worlds. Doesn't matter what you believe, it's your choice. I recommend this movie for those who want to see something weird, but something that can prove itself the worth of a young soul. There's a prequel, which is based in the same context. (The devil's backbone). The idea of have a child on the main character for me is such as see the innocent life turned into something that they wouldn't be able to do. ",

My only problem was that I didn't understand Spanish, so I constantly had to take my eyes off the beautiful images to look at the annoying subtitles. I think that what made this movie truly incredible was the combination of utterly fantastic fantasy and stunningly brutal realism. Some of the scenes with Captain Vidal were very reminiscent of Cronenberg's work in ""A History of Violence"". There's no fantasy movie I can think of that's exactly like the elements you see in this one, but in those parts of the movie it was almost like ""Labyrinth"" taking a few steps toward ""The Cell"" and stopping before it crossed the threshold. I know how stupid it is to compare something this original to anything else, but I think it's a useful frame of reference.

776,5 May 2020,krational66,8, Aofeiliya and her flowers,"It was 1944 in Spain, and the smoke from the civil war had not yet cleared.
Major fighting in the Spanish civil war ended in 1939. That year, the left party led by the republican army defeated, general franco led the fascist officers overthrew Spain's second republic, the establishment of a military dictatorship. The surviving republican army was forced to organize into small units to wage guerrilla warfare in the mountains. The military regime carried out a ruthless campaign against the guerrillas to consolidate the fruits of victory.
Ophelia, 14, took her book and followed her pregnant mother to the mountains where her stepfather, captain Vidal, was stationed. The captain was ordered to round up the guerrillas hiding in the mountains. He was an outstanding fascist soldier, self-disciplined, cold, resolute, brave and inaccessible.
Here ophelia, a lover of fairy tales, found a dilapidated maze. Carved on a beam at the entrance to the maze was the face of pan, with three black holes in its eyes and mouth, giving it a wild and mysterious look. Right in the middle of the maze was a round chamber in the ground. Down the stone staircase, in the middle of the chamber is a miniature maze. In the middle was a stone statue, the top of which was the face of the same pan with the three black holes. Below was a girl with a baby in her arms.
Legend has it that the spirit of the underworld princess still roamed the earth, and her father had been waiting for her reincarnation and to take her home. Ophelia found an old pan in the maze. He will give ophelia three tasks. If she can successfully complete the three tests before the full moon, she can return to her father's palace.
From then on the story jumps back and forth between the magic kingdom and the mountain battlefield. One moment it was little lady fighting ugly toad; One moment it was guerrilla informants trying to smuggle letters, food and medicine; For a while the little princess in the white devil's hand narrowly escaped death, for a while is the captain of the captives of the bloody methods. Together on the night of the full moon, we saw the end of a story that fantasy and reality cannot tell apart. It's all so powerful.
In Shakespeare's famous Hamlet, Ophelia is the lover of prince Hamlet. Hamlet feigned madness for revenge and abandoned her. Later, the prince killed her father, Polonius. The double whammy sends ophelia into a real frenzy, and she ends up drowning while trying to break flowers.
The name ""ophelia"" is like a huge shadow hanging over the little girl. The beautiful ophelia was forced by the reality into a person's fantasy world, she told her unborn brother a story of roses. The rose that gives immortality grows on the top of a high mountain. To get close to it is to go through a number of terrible trials and tribulations. Gradually people forget the original purpose, just pass on the difficulties along the way from generation to generation. Long in the mountains, can bring people eternal roses so lonely waiting for the end of time.
The fairy tale ophelia tells her brother also hints at the future of her early death. Ophelia in Hamlet falls into a river while folding flowers. Our ophelia died while pursuing her dream of an eternal kingdom.
It's not them that are crazy, it's the reality they live in.
At that time, people did not know whether they could see the sun of tomorrow. Or yesterday they were reading newspapers and letters home in the cave, and today they were killed by cold bullets. They all aspire to build a better country, but the path they choose makes it impossible for them to co-exist.
The reality of cruelty is that soldiers will expertly fire a second round at the head of a dead enemy to ensure a clean sweep of the battlefield -- something that both sides can do regardless of political position. Torture tools small, simple but the effect of the ""good"" is extremely horrible.
The cruelty in the magic is that the white magic that eats children has even its fingertips soaked in the blood of old people. Next to the ogre's table laden with delicacies were hills of children's shoes.
Most cruelly, ophelia was killed, and she breathed her last in the glory of the underground kingdom. And that world turned out to be just a fantasy of her loneliness.
The camera tells these details calmly and carefully. No emotion, no big close-up, no blur, no emotion.
That's the end of the 1944 story. It was a long thirty-one year before the day on which general franco and his regime were to return to normal. There are many more children whose lives will pass quietly.",

I used the """" since the director really surprises us all in the end, and apparently the ""real"" story in the sense that it is not an illusion in the movie can be viewed as the one that we at the first instance would considered as the fictional. The fantastic underworld of Ophelia is quite real in the movie, and she is being tested in our ""real"" world so that she can prove that she deserves to come back to the place from where she had escaped. I believe this could be the perfect allegory for a scenario of war, irrespective of the location and the time. The director has chosen the Spanish war but any war scenario would work for this movie. Although my opinion is quite subjective, I would say that the point of this movie is that any war can be so horrible and inhuman that even a perfect fairy tale should be seen as anything more real than it for us. This is why the characters are so stereotypical in the movie, except for the ones that are more closely related to the ""fairy tale"": Ophelia and Mercedes.

This is a defenent top 10 movie of all time (in my eyes anyways) At times it makes me think of something Takashi Miike could have made. Zebraman, hobgoblins and the great wall, audition and several other of his movies has this dream/fiction/reality theme going that reminds me a bit, but Pans labyrinth just seems to have a whole lot more work behind it than (I make 5 movies every year) Miike usually does. Also Hayao Miyazaki comes to mind with the colorful and almost magical storytelling, hell parts of it even made me think of the master him self Terry Gilliam. The monsters are awesome, and even though the pale man is freaky and scary as hell, he is no match for the truly utterly nasty monster ""captain evil"". In a really solid 2006 when it comes to movies I would personally have to put this outing on top as the best of the year.",

In reference to Michael Halliday's functions, the ideational is represented amazingly throughout this piece of cinematography. In terms of mise-en-sense the scenery of the production brings reality and life to the film. The blue tints reflected during cold scenes, as seen in figure... help the audience to understand the emotions they should be feeling towards the character and also help the audience to feel as though they are part of the story being narrated. Contrastingly the use of strong prominent colours such as red and orange, as seen in figure... during danger scenes also help create the intensity and the threat of the events unfolding - again encouraging the audience to feel as though they are part of the narrative. The use of Spanish throughout the film makes the historical context of the film a strong presence and a constant reminder to the audience that the film was placed during the Spanish Civil war - constantly reminding them of the horror in the real world. The composition of the cinematography helps build intertextuality with the audience. The use of long shots helps the audience distance themselves from the danger and intensifies what is going on during the events of the scene, this can be seen in figure... The use of low shots also helps intensify the horror and threat of certain characters, this can mainly been seen through the use of Pale Man's character. Ultimately the composition of the camera angle helps the audience to distinguish the different emotions to be felt among different characters and situations. Del Toro does an amazing justice to incorporating the real and the fantasy throughout the film. The abuse that Ofelia receives not only from her step-farther Captain Vidal, but also the threat of the Pale Man helps create sympathy and empathy from the audience. However the presentation of characters such as Ofelia and Maribel Verdu portrays how females can be strong and domineering - especially during a time such as the Spanish Civil war. In conclusion this piece of cinematography is beautifully accomplished. Achieving empathy, attention and suspension that is sought by the audience. The film itself gives a accurate representation into the hardship that is faced during the war and how fantasy and make believe can create the most magical adventure in such a dark era. Del Toros ability to take all things childish and make-believe and mould them into a master piece that can be enjoyed by adults is genius. Pans Labyrinth should go down as one of the greatest pieces of cinematography in film.",

Everybody just talked about how great it was, we even talked about it in our Spanish class, but it seems to me that people really overestimate this film. At leas to me it seemed like a very weak story, and this was increased by the supposed ""fantasy"" genre. Fantasy films are for kids too, right? So why was there all that explicit violence, for crying out loud. And the ""Laberinto del Fauno"" turned out to be little more than just a subplot to the whole civil war story. I have the impression that here in Mexico there only was a hype because OH MY GOD a Mexican director, it was Harry Potter 3 all over again (Which I also found the worst of all, but is seen here like an incredible masterpiece). I give this film three stars for some good acting... Most people will probably disagree with me, but this movie was but two hours of boredom to me.",

799,15 October 2018,fra-70745,9, A greatly executed fantasy and a decently executed drama.,"Pan Labyrinth, directed by Guillermo del Toro was a story set in Spain in the 1940's that displayed two story lines. The first one being a fascist group during the civil war located in the woods to keep out the rebels. The second one being an 11 year old girl by the name of Ofelia, who is trapped in her own fairytale land. Ofelia's mother, Carmen, is a widow who remarries Capitan Vidal, a murdering sadist. Alongside of the Capitan, a woman named Mercedes was his main maid, who proved to be a powerful, resilient woman behind closed doors. These three prominent female characters are what make the film complete the circle.
 Pan's Labyrinth is a film directed by Guillermo del Toro that takes place in the 1940's in Spain. This film is a drama, fantasy, war genre-based film that was published in 2006. This film is about an adventurous, young girl by the name of Ofelia that was sent with her pregnant mother to meet her new step-father, the captain of the Spanish army. During her stay, she comes upon a fairy who has essentially ""chosen"" her and leads her to a garden in the center of the labyrinth. She is acquainted with a faun who tells her that she is from royal descent and in order to reach her kingdom, she must complete 3 tasks. She spends her time throughout the film completing each terrifying task in order to reach the end of her destiny. Within this time, a ghastly chain of events takes place involving the captain, her mother and Mercedes. 
Pan's Labyrinth portrayed an effective fantasy by creating blue filters and bright yellow filters when she would travel off to her fairytale land. The fairies and detailed monsters create an artistic approach, leading the audience to be further intrigued into this fairytale land. However, the drama aspect of this film is not effective. There are some scenes that could have used further details to expand on the present moment. Also, a selected amount of scenes were quickly ran through and not enough time was placed on the drama taking place in that specific scene. The intended audience meant for this film is someone between the ages of 13-18. Although, this is a fairytale and fairy tales are usually meant for a younger audience, the monster-like characters in this film are way too scary for young children. There are also disturbing scenes in this film that involve: amputation, death and brutality that is not advisable for young children. An example of the effectiveness of a fantasy land, is when she goes to the garden to meet with the faun. Everything is detailed and has a mystical feel to the scenes. Compared to the lack of effectiveness on the drama scenes, for example when Mercedes was caught helping the rebels, it was a short-lived scene in my opinion. There could have been more emphasis placed, since this movie was revolved around the Spanish in the civil war. Maribel Verdu was remarkable in her performance. Everything she felt, I felt. On the other hand, ""Ofelia"", Ivana Baquero being one of the main actresses of the movie was an exceptional character. The pace of the film is enhanced with the editing and camera shots. They did a great job with close ups and focusing on weird details. 
 I rate this movie a 7.5 on a scale 1-10. Although, Pan's Labyrinth was a good movie, it was not the best movie I have ever seen. I would also be very careful about bringing your children with you depending on how old they are due to the little amount of graphic scenery in this film. Overall, it was an enjoyable film; however, I would not waste time on watching it again.",

801,18 December 2013,anordall,8, About the reality of the soul,"Most people seem to be accepting the notion that the girl's fantasy world is a form of compensation and/or escape mechanism for/from the brutal world that surrounds her, but there is much more to it! Those familiar with psychoanalysis, and mainly Jung's deep psychology will recognize a plethora of symbols in the film's images, from lingams to mandalas, archetypical characters like the king and the queen and so on. But what has touched me the strongest is the solemnity and depth of the words pronounced by an unseen priest (?) at some moments, about fate and the wisdom and mercy of God. Some of the most basic religious issues are present in the movie (even the forbidden fruit), as is Jung's concept of individualization. Del Toro wanted to make us think about these issues; the movie is not a contraposition of reality vs fantasy, but an insight into the human mind/soul, and that reminds me of a quote from Herzog's Fitzcarraldo: ""life is a succession of illusions (including violence, I say) that won't allow us to perceive the reality of dreams"".",

805,7 June 2021,dorMancyx,8, So This Is Del Toro's Child Fiction,"I have seriously regretted bringing my younger brother to watch this movie with me. Without background knowledge about the Spanish civil war, I could still sense the despair and futility expressed under the surreal surface of magic and fairy tales. Pan's Labyrinth narrates the story of a innocent girl's adventures of proving her qualification as the princess of underworld, however while in reality she faces the death of her mother, cruel and conservative stepfather, and life threaten led by the civil war. All characters represent an essential element that causes the painful ending of the story: caring and straightforward Mercedes, fragile yet loving mother Carmen, merciless and opinionated general, last but not least the knowledgeable and impartial doctor. These substantial characters successfully stirs the foundational emotions of the audience. The only defect I could think of is the lack of connection between Ofelia's tasks and the development of the war at the last segment of the film. The heartbreaking death of the young princess makes me wonder if all of the fantasy is simply the child's imagination, and her death is simply inevitable and irreversible. This is left for every audience to self-introspect.",

Finding her new life hard to bear, Ofelia seeks refuge in a mysterious labyrinth and encounters Pan (a faun), the half-man, half-goat creature of mythology, who tells her she is actually a long-lost princess of a magical kingdom beneath the earth. However, in order to make her way back and be reunited with her true family, she must accomplish three tasks¬Ö Guillermo del Toro, Director of Pan's Labyrinth, says, ""I've always preferred genres to be mixed.

Though Ophelia is the focus of this story, it is important to note that the story also switches perspectives to Captain Vidal for a majority of the story, and later to characters on the opposing side of his forces; however his point of view as opposed to Ophelia's is what I believe to be the focus of the story.",

The one plot is the fantasy one of the girl's imagination and the magical underworld and another ""Real World"" Plot is about an ongoing War.

I don't mind violence at all. But this movie really disappointed me. It was also a slow, boring, and relentlessly upsetting experience to sit through, and people in the cinema where I saw it were upset to be sure. What worries me is that we are meant to celebrate moments of violence in the film. After seeing innocent people hurt and hurt and hurt again, the violence then turns toward the villains in the third act. But I was disturbed by this lesson! Teaching sadistic revenge, as the film does, is not responsible. And the tragic ending just made it all pointless, without a payoff.
