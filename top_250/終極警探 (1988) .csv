0,15 May 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10, Not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best movies of the action genre,"Even if the non-action parts are a tad slow in comparison, that is more than compensated by so many things that makes Die Hard so brilliant.",/
1,25 June 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, It can't be bettered,"This original action classic has been hugely influential over the years - and it's no surprise, as it's one of the best action thrillers ever made. New meaning is brought to the word ""action"" as here it is exhilarating, furious and nothing less than exciting. The premise is simple: one location, one good guy and twelve bad guys. Cue lots of explosions, fist fights, blood, violence, and plenty of shooting too. The thrills come from the suspense of Willis using his wits as well as his brawn to fight the bad guys and save the hostages.",r
2,7 February 2007,Robert_duder,10, Was there Action Films before Die Hard?? Who cares!! Die Hard is the patriarch of modern action.,"Of course the Action Genre existed before Die Hard. After all you had The Terminator, Commando, Top Gun, Roadhouse...but didn't Die Hard absolutely revolutionize the eighties action Genre. It came like a savior and encompassed everything that would blow you right out the back of the theater and made Bruce Willis an absolute idol in the Action world and for good reason. Die Hard had pointless nudity, scores of bad language, bloody death, guns, explosions, a gritty, tough as nails, sweating, dirty hero that takes on everyone with nothing more than a hand gun and his brains. If you watch Willis in Die Hard it's a thing of beauty. His shirt torn off, bare foot, wounds all over him...he looks like he just crawled from a war rather than stalking terrorists through an enormous high rise office building in L.A. The script was so dead on...it was basic, it was to the point, it has great sarcastic humor and one liners that could never be forgotten. And Willis was the man to pull it all together. Add a decent supporting cast, a guy on the ground who is like his partner and a MacGyver style of killing bad guys that will go down in history...THIS IS DIE HARD.",e
3,4 February 2018,ivo-cobra8,10, The greatest bad-ass best action movie hands down my personal favorite number 1 movie of all time,"Die Hard (1988) the first action film is by far one of the greatest best action movies of all time from the 80's till this day hands down. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! I love it so damn much and I have fun watching it so much. I have to talk about this movie: It is one man army fighting against a team of terrorists with automatic weapons and plastic explosives. Bruce Willis performance was excellent in this movie John McClane is his best role ever. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! It's stay in my heart forever. To me it felt this film realistic and it makes you think that you are alone trapped in a building against bunch of terrorists what will you do? ",v
4,30 October 2022,Mr-Fusion,10," ""Welcome to the party, pal!""","(In brief)
By any measure, ""Die Hard"" was a pretty muscular movie back in '88. It made cultural icons out of its two stars and the explosions were guaranteed crowd pleasers. The script (note-perfect) ran like clockwork with setup-and-payoff and was stocked with memorable characters throughout; the hero reluctant and vulnerable, his stakes ever ratcheting, while the action would just keep mounting until . . . Well, there wasn't any more opulent high-rise. It doesn't matter what time of year you watch this movie, it functions perfectly in July and December (or even today, so close to Halloween) and always his the spot. It's the ultimate ""You can't go wrong with"" movie.",i
5,4 January 2005,dee.reid,10," You'll ""Die Hard"" with this action-lover's action movie","One could claim that 1988's ""Die Hard"" is one of the most influential action movies ever made because it basically revolutionized one of the most copied (but never matched, at least in terms of quality) formulas: a loner, by some unique twist of fate, battles it out with an ""x"" number of terrorists in an enclosed environment.",e
6,5 May 2016,PredragReviews,9," Now I Have a Machine Gun, Ho-Ho-Ho","In stepped John McTiernan and Bruce Willis with Die Hard. Willis, most famous at the time for the comic TV Series 'Moonlighting', made a perfect ordinary-man-in-an-extraordinary-situation action hero. He was believable as John McClane and not immune to being hurt. He bled and felt pain, a first for the genre. And yet his cool confident delivery of a great wisecracking, intelligent script made him all the cooler. But most credit should go to Director John McTiernan, king of the sophisticated action flick. He made action movies slick, smart and full of pace and wit while never letting up on the bullets, cars and bombs front. ",w
7,3 December 2015,Screen_Blitz,9, Influential and revolutionary action movie that redefined its genre,"In the late 1980s, Director John McTiernan refined the action film genre with this action- packed thriller that not only stars Bruce Willis is the role that defined his career, but also brought impressed audiences everywhere with ecstatic action sequences complete with amazing practical effects, inspiring characters, and one of the most original scripts for an action movie written for its time. This movie stars Bruce Willis as John McClane, a New York cop who heads on vacation to Los Angeles for the holidays, to spend Christmas with his wife Holly Genero (played by Bonnie Bedelia) and kids. Upon arriving at the Nakatomi Plaza building where she works, he and his wife ended having an argument dealing with family matters. Their dispute is eventually interrupted when the building becomes under attack by a dozen German terrorists lead by the ruthless Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman) who's intent on robbing the company of its money. Pitted against overwhelming odds and Gruber's diabolical mind, John McClane must take matters into his own hands and fight off the terrorists who have his wife, along with hundreds of innocent civilians held hostage, with no aid from the Los Angeles Police Department who are helpless against the terrorists' overwhelming power.",/

Since it's also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing.  ""Die Hard"" is lean, mean, and doesn't contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction, the action, the story, the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to big-budget action movie perfection.

16,6 January 2017,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,10," ""Die Hard""- Quite simply the greatest action-adventure film ever made.","It's almost unfathomable that in just one year's time, the original entry in the ""Die Hard"" saga will be thirty years old. And yet, even then, it will still remain in its position as indisputably the greatest action-adventure ever committed to the screen. In every way remarkable, entertaining and breathlessly exhilarating, it is the quintessential gold-standard when it comes to action. A masterpiece of filmmaking, ""Die Hard"" took the world by storm in 1988 and even with inconsistent quality in sequels, it still enthralls and entertains thanks to sharp writing, perfect casting, exquisite performances and top-notch direction. It's hard to imagine that anything will ever top it.",8

26,20 May 2016,Horror-yo,7, Die Hard,"Yup. That's the title I'm giving this short review. Nothing else comes to mind that would do it more justice. The time is 1988, a young Bruce Willis stars as Officer John McClane in an excellently built, explosive late 80's action classic that actually runs at about 2hrs10min but is a blast to watch. It's not perfect. It's got its flaws. But to hell with those, this is just too much fun to not be watched, and even if you're the intellectual kind, if you like cinema, check this out as it is a lesson on how to make a campy, action-filled thriller the right way. It's a bit long, and yeah the relationship with the black cop is a bit rushed during the ending scene... but the cunning intelligent villain is here, vs the anti-hero, guns, big explosions, the cops, the mischievous lines Willis delivers...this is fun man. It's no masterpiece but it's just fun. Just pick it up and, have fun. It's all this is, although it takes real knowledge to do it well and smooth.",_

You get a movie for an eternity! It's cool, it's fun, fast, packed with adrenaline and that feeling when you root for the protagonist to win. In my country, the name of the movie is literally translated as: ""Die like a man"", so it's definitely a movie you watch when you feel down and don't feel that your ego is alive. I give it 10/10!

32,7 December 2019,aidanratesmovies,10, The Best Christmas Movie Ever Made,"Die Hard is not simply one of the best action films ever made, but one that is easily able to stand the test of time, and do so in style. Die Hard shines brilliantly with some clever set pieces, action sequences, fun dialogue, and some great performances. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman are obviously the greatest standouts in this 80's classic. It's surprising to say that audiences at the time were not too thrilled with the idea of him as action hero, and against all odds, he delivered a more than well, not to mention iconic, performance that simply no one could ever come close to capturing the same charm. Alan Rickman at the time was practically unknown, and with him as Hans Gruber, it's certainly a job well done into his life of stardom. Some other great performances include Bonnie Bedelia as Holly, Reginald VelJohnson as Al, and De'voreaux white as the limo driver Argyle. The film is also fantastically shot, surprisingly well written (for the most part), and wonderfully coordinated. In the end, Die Hard is not only a legitimate classic with more than enough reasons to justify it, but a timeless one as well.

Starring Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, Alexander Godunov, William Atherton & Paul Gleason, McTiernan's movie went on to make over $100 million in profit at the box office alone.

35,8 October 2007,JoeytheBrit,8, A Classic,"Die Hard is the film that re-wrote the action genre, sparked countless copycat flicks (all of them inferior) and signalled the beginning of the slow, terminal decline of the careers of Messrs Schwarzenegger and Stallone (and the somewhat faster dive into obscurity of the likes of van Damme, Dudikoff, etc). The film holds up surprisingly well, despite all those copies. It should be showing its age, but it doesn't, and the subtext of average working joe threatened by  and fighting back against  faceless multinational corporations (legal or otherwise) is still relevant today. Looking through the principal players, the fact that neither the director, the writer or the star has since achieved such giddy heights suggests that this film was one of those fortunate accidents: everything clicked, and we were somehow given a classic in a genre that throws up precious few. This is the kind of film that's easy to dip into  but nearly impossible to tear yourself away from once you have.",

40,4 January 2019,bowmanblue,10, The greatest action movie (not to star Arnie),"I've decided to leave a review for 'Die Hard' exactly thirty years since its release in 1988. Partly because it still holds up after all that time as one of the greatest action movies ever made and, secondly, because it has just (officially?) been classified as a 'Christmas movie.' So, does it promote festive cheer and goodwill to all men? Or does it just give you the manual on how to kill unlimited bad guys with a machine gun, a witty quip or two and dirty feet. Probably the latter really, but, for the record, it is SET at Christmas and a famous Christmas song even plays it out. What more do you need to pull a cracker and eat Xmas pudding to?",

44,28 June 2007,fmarkland32,10, Now I have a machine gun...Ho Ho Ho!,"On Christmas eve, John McClane(Bruce Willis) is over at his wife's office party when hi-tech thieves break into said building and look to steal millions of dollars. While collecting hostages in the process, however there is one man who saves the day and it's McClane in what is one of the greatest action movies ever made. I must admit that i'm shocked it took so long to for me to review this. Over the years this has been in my DVD collection, I try to watch it on TV every time it's on and most of all I think it's there with The Terminator,Hunt For Red October and Rocky as the ultimate genre film. The real reason why Die Hard is so great is due to the suspense factor. Sure the action sequences are brilliant and very exciting but what really earns the high marks is just how suspenseful the movie is, it's one of those movies where the hero actually does the most logical things. Unlike the sequels per say, Willis uses the element of surprise and cunning to fight off the bad guys. Unlike the sequels where he was far more one man army. As it stands I remember seeing Die Hard in theaters and remembering being very skeptical of Willis (He was on that show with Cybil Shepherd) but knew right away after watching Die Hard, that Willis would be a great. However as it stands, this movie is a classic. On the other hand it's also a rare instance where one might want to buy a special edition DVD for the extras.

52,23 December 2021,nickenchuggets,9, Yippee ki yay,"Believe it or not, many people are dead serious when they say that Die Hard falls into the category of Christmas films. There actually is some truth to this, but the story itself doesn't really have anything to do with it. Because it's often considered one of the best action movies, the focus is squarely set on that and little attention is payed to the impending holiday, especially with regards to the huge amount of cursing the movie has. For an action movie, I was a little surprised by Die Hard's somewhat long set up. Before things start exploding and bullets start flying everywhere, the storyline has to be laid down through a number of dialogue scenes. The plot centers on John McClane (Bruce Willis), an NYPD cop who is flying to LA in order to clear up some misunderstandings with his wife, Holly, and hopefully get his marriage back on track. He is scheduled to meet her is a big skyscraper owned by the Nakatomi Corporation during a christmas party they're hosting. The holiday is tomorrow, and there's a bunch of people not wanting to miss any excitement. As John and Holly start talking, the building suddenly comes under the control of a group of West German terrorists led by the sophisticated (but also evil) Hans Gruber. Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his associates aren't just your average, run of the mill street thugs, and storm the building with missile launchers, stun grenades, and automatic rifles in their possession. Hans' ultimate objective is to break into the building's vault, which contains over 600 million dollars worth of bonds. John manages to stay undetected when the terrorists start shooting up the party and kill several hostages. He later witnesses Gruber fatally shoot Mr. Takagi (Holly's boss) for refusing to give Gruber access to the money. Even without the code, Hans is determined to break open the vault and assigns a computer nerd to try and find the right pass code. Meanwhile, John wreaks havoc throughout the building and kills several terrorists who Gruber sends after him in order to put his interference to an end. The police eventually form a perimeter around the building, but even a SWAT team is unable to breach the terrorists' defenses. McClane causes more chaos for the terrorists and manages to kill some of them in a huge explosion with plastic explosives, which just serves to irritate Gruber even further. He resorts to having one of John's friends, Ellis, try to talk some sense into him over a walkie talkie, but Gruber kills him too when John refuses to cooperate. In a particularly intense scene, Hans tries to track down John himself, posing as a defenseless hostage who doesn't know where he is. He almost succeeds in killing John after the latter willingly hands him a pistol, but it doesn't have any bullets in it. A subsequent gunfight initiated by the terrorists, trying to rescue their stricken leader, leaves John badly wounded. Meanwhile, outside the building, a cop talks with John on a radio, convincing him he will succeed. The FBI has also showed up and orders the building's power to be shut off, which inadvertently ends up helping the terrorists because it disables the vault doors. Gruber makes ridiculous demands to the FBI outside, saying he will let the hostages live (but not release them) if the cops agree to releasing various terrorists in prisons throughout places such as Northern Ireland and Canada. The FBI lies and says they will do it and send helicopters to evacuate Hans, but they will actually send attack helicopters instead. As the hostages are led to the roof, John makes the sickening discovery that the whole roof is wired to explode in order to kill them. McClane fires his gun wildly into the air, telling the hostages the roof is just one big death zone and they all need to head downstairs. In a terrible twist of irony, a helicopter pilot thinks John is shooting because he's a terrorist, and orders his crew to open fire. John is almost killed by the heli, but Gruber blows the roof to bits and it is destroyed. The hostages are all safe now, except for Holly, who has been personally kidnapped by Gruber after he figures out she is John's spouse. John tapes a pistol to his back, pretends to surrender to Gruber, and shoots him when he lets his guard down. Hans is finally killed after being dropped from a window. With his main adversary finished off and the terrorist threat neutralized, John and his wife leave the devastated building. A reporter tries to gets John's thoughts on the spectacular event, but he's punched by Holly. This is quite a good movie. It's not perfect, but I think it manages to set itself apart from many other action movies because of its main character. Bruce Willis plays a man who is not an unstoppable, (somewhat) mindless killing machine like John Rambo or The Terminator, for example. There's several times in Die Hard where he looks to be in a vulnerable state, and he is nearly killed several times. This helps make his character more believable, because no matter how tough you are, you can still die. Another person who deserves praise (arguably more than Willis) is Alan Rickman, who plays Hans, leader of the terrorists. He is a sly, shrewd, and thoroughly despicable person, with many reluctantly agreeing to call him a human being. He kills several people throughout the movie, but he always has class doing so. Lots of villains in movies are what I call stupid evil, meaning that they're loud and boisterous, thinking that makes them intimidating. Gruber on the other hand rarely needs to raise his voice. He's just simply a psychopath. I also enjoyed how there are several references to older movies throughout this one, but not many. Hans often taunts John on his walkie talkie as he knows he is trying to interfere with his terrorist plans, and calls him a ""cowboy wannabe"", similar to John Wayne. Right before Gruber is killed, he thinks John is really surrendering to him this time, and remarks how he won't be riding into the sunset with Grace Kelly now. In all, Die Hard is a pretty lengthy movie, but it is worth seeing because John McClane is much more believable as a character than your ordinary hero. He's not invincible, and it shows. There's other reasons to watch this, but that's my primary one. I still don't really consider this a christmas movie, however.",

However, my idea of a Xmas movie is something that the whole family can sit down to and feel all warm inside! This film is not for the faint hearted and its amazing how this film still feels so contemporary when watching in 2015 when you realise it was made in the late 80's. Bruce Willis was finishing his comedy role in Moonlighting when he starred in this and was the casting director's final choice behind Arnie who turned the role down. What a stroke of luck for Bruce. You have to admire his acting in this film and I couldn't help but think how he is so much better an actor than someone like Keanu Reeves who is so wooden in comparison. Great plot, great characters and I loved the fact the FBI guys were made to look like idiots. Interesting to learn that in Germany, the bad guys were made to be British!

If you don't like this movie, that's fine, I was just joking in the title, but from my perspective, there is no reason to not like this film. The first thing I want to say about this legendary film is that there can be good 1st acts in films, but normally they are the worst part in the movie, which it is here, but in this film every act is consistently amazing and the second and 3rd act are only slightly better than the 1st one. Bruce Willis is a laughable action star, right? No, he is so cool and he seems like a genuine cop wondering how he got himself into this situation. Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber has an even better acting performance and if they got some random other guy who was popular, but just ok at acting, this film would not even be in my top 20, even with the great writing. It takes place on Christmas, and it is of course and argument whether it is a Christmas movie, personally, I think Die Hard 2 is a Christmas movie, but not Die Hard. Sorry, this review has been all over the place, I'm new to these, but the last thing I want to talk about is the humor, basically all of the humor is given to Bruce Willis, and I'm glad. I watched a 45 minute documentary on this movie, and the things he says in these movies are definitely things he would actually say in real life. Overall this is a great movie for adults, and even some kids who are mature enough to watch it. Honestly this is a great dad-son movie. 10/10 MASTERPIECE!",

72,12 April 2021,searchanddestroy-1,10, Most brilliant action thriller of all times.,"I won't say much about this film, the ""father"" of a new kind of action movies. There was a before DIE HARD, and there is an after DIE HARD. The same with CONAN, DIRTY HARRY, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, HEAT, SCARFACE and so on. The kind of movie which provokes a chain reaction of hundreds of rip-offs. The only detail which I would like to talk about is the novel which this masterpiece is inspired from, a book written by Roderick Thorpe, the author of THE DETECTIVE. I read both books and I am still astonished to see how much they both are different from each other. As if you compared HAMLET and STAGECOACH. Same hero character in both, but for two soooo different topics and atmosphere, style and writing. And the novel seems very close to the movie, yes, but not on the meaning. In the novel the hero was visiting not his wife but his daughter. She was working for a huge company which, in the late seventies, sold weapons to the Chile dictatorship, a right winged regime that the terrorist of the story wanted to denounce. So, you see, this scheme is really far from the film's ""message"". The novel is really gritty, bitter in the meaning, The hero in the book doesn't hesitate to kill in cold blood some female terrorists who, at the end, fight for what they are convinced to be a fair fight against facism in Chile. The book is really immersive, radical, visceral, profound and dark. That's just what I want to say. One last thing, there is not a day in my life where I don't think about the loss of John McTiernan whoo seems to have the great difficulties to emerge since his relased from jail, back in 2014.

75,25 December 2019,jayjaycee,10," Welcome to best action movie of all time, pal!","""Die Hard"" is a 1988 action film directed by John McTiernan starring Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. As the popular meme states, there are people who think this action classic is a Christmas movie and people who are wrong. Since its original release (as it was told me) this film has been the only choice for the perfect Christmas Eve in my family. A few years have passed since I joined this tradition and immediately fell in love with it - and even now it's the highlight of the day to me. It doesn't only enjoy cult status because people watch it during the most wonderful time of the year and feel great thanks to it, it's a cinematic masterpiece that's near perfect. With the beginning shots, the atmosphere begins to set in immediately. The best of it all are the plot and the screenplay: Not only are there iconic protagonists, each and every supporting character has a well designed personality and plays a major part in the story. Additionally, it's perfectly paced and keeps a packing tension every single second, mostly due to the extreme ingenuity of the writers. It might take place in a limited area, but still delivers a powerful and far-reaching experience. From bombastic and realistic explosions to intelligent shootouts, the film develops a scenario that never becomes boring. It offers enough variety and lives from its love for detail, thus enabling the viewer to dive in the situation completly. John McClane, the sarcastic anti hero is getting along perfectly with the calculated and cold antagonist Hans Gruber (brilliantly played by the late legend Alan Rickman). It's always a great joy to see how they fight each other verbally and in the end face to face. Thanks to outstanding editing and a ingenious sound score the buildup to the final showdown is always a treat for a perfectionst like me. In most instances it feels like a video game I'll never get the chance to play myself and that's always a sad realisation. All in all, this action film is the perfect film for Christmas Eve and ranks high up in the list of the best Christmas films of all time (only a certain Frank Capra film is better) and will always be a part of my tradition. It never gets bad or ages badly, even more than 30 years after it hit the big screen it's way better than most of the blockbusters of our modern cinema. Often copied but never reached, it will forever remain on the top spot of action films. To me, Christmas can only begin when I see Hans Gruber fall of the Nakatomi Plaza. Otherwise it's not Christmas.",

77,28 May 2007,arthera09,9, This movie is so much fun,"I think this is a great movie. I love the campy one liners and the over the top action, but it was a great movie. It was well paced and they are no real complaints about the movie. Rickman was amazing and it is one of the best bad guys performances and the one scene when we snaps at John's wife is priceless. It is kind of fun to see how a lot of action movies pull from a lot of stuff from this movie (even though I sure this movie got a lot of it's substance from other movies). One of the highlights of the movie is the music and when the bad guys actually manage to open the vault one really feels a swelling of emotion as the music grows. The one problem I have is that the LAPD is not that dumb and the FBI agents are not that dumb and the fact that Al knew better than both of them was kind of silly, but I did like the dynamic of the two FBI agents and the way they fit into the movie as a bunch of idiots, but it was almost a little too much. The humor they tried to inject with the black guy who was cracking the vault was a little dry, but not to the point where I hated him. The limo driver's smile got annoying too, but I liked his character for the most part. Bruce Willis did a perfect job with the character and played him perfect. I like action films like this where there is unnecessary swearing and violence, but it works and I hate how Hollywood is making a lot of action films with a pg-13 rating when i think it would be so much more enjoyable with just letting them swear and be really violent. I know one does not need the violence, but I think it does so much more for the movie experience by letting the characters express themselves with their violence. The last gripe I have is that the ending with Karl jumping up out of nowhere was totally unnecessary and it really annoyed me. The cop did not need a complete arc and John's and his hug was all the ending needed. This will probably always be one of the my favorite action films.",

88,6 December 2012,ironhorse_iv,8, Need to recharge life's batteries? Watch Die Hard!,"Die Hard is a Christmas movie directed by John McTiernan that's not traditional at all, but still watched each year during the holidays. Die Hard serves as an alternated holiday movie. Die Hard opens up with off duty New York Police Officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) attend a Christmas Party at Nakatomi Skyscrapper with his wife in downtown LA. Out of nowhere the plot kicks in the door as German terrorist and thieves take the people in the building hostage and start to make demands to the police. The group is led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) a brutal man whom able to have casual persona and an an intimidating one in a few seconds. Hans also had a casual attitude to killing even willing to kill his own men. Alan Rickman is able to show that Han has a curt attitude to people whom he did not know and jokey nature with those he knew. Alan Rickman is able to make him out to be somewhat of a suit. He flaunted his knowledge and boast of his education to anybody, but McClane manage to slip from his grip. The film follows his exploits as he slowly engages the German terrorists one by one barefoot to retake the tower while dealing in depth of personal pain. The broken glass on his barefoot can be seen as his Achilles's heel. McClane lacks heroic virtues and qualities like Achilles. He can be explains to be a Byronic hero or Anti-Hero by having similar traits to those who like being arrogant and cynical. He is also cunning and able to adapt. He has a dis-tasted for social institutions and norms when he was at the party. John McClane works better alone than in a crowd. Die Hard gives their hero, a cutting edge from cookie cut heroes. What Die Hard does well is keeping a small scale budget while exporting a big blockbuster result. Most of the movie takes taking place entirely within a few floors of the Nakatomi Plaza. It was one of the first of the limited-space, small cast action films. This formula of putting characters in limited area spawn great sequels in their own right, but also an entirely new sub-division of the action genre. The movie is condensed in a few scenes and areas that get so well know. It simplified in such a way that lets the characters and the action really develop and shine through. While having a few explosion-filled sequences, the movie allows the audience to care for the characters and not feel like disconnected from the story-arch or the depth of the characters portray. The movie takes light-hearted approach to the genre, incorporating many less-than-serious elements and one-liners keeps the movie fun and enjoyable no matter how many times watched through, but it comes with a cost. Sub-characters in the film seem corny, low-intelligent or bad written. The scenes with the LA police for example drag the movie down and slow it down. The film brings in Reginald Vel Johnson playing a role as a cop which doomed the actor to playing cops for the rest of his life. He continues to be type cast to this day. Reginald Vel Johnson's character has a trouble past where he accidentally shot a kid and now wouldn't be able to shot. While they did give some back-story to Reginald Vel Johnson character, most of his lines were bad and his actions in the movie are nearly useless. All the main characters in this film are fairly complex and well written compared to most of the dumb action hero movies of the 1980s. Still the police chief doesn't serve any purpose except for delaying police intervention which would have wrapped the story up faster. Matters would have been more easily solved had the chief acquired an average intelligence. Since the sub-characters took a backseat, the character of McClane and Gruber makes the movie watchable. The sarcastic nature of McClane's character against the whimsical Gruber makes this hero and villain pairing one of the finest in film history. The movie even makes a famous quote out of its hero's swearing mouth that can be still heard today. The language can be harsh and the violence too much but it's a good movie. The plot might seem rudimentary and unoriginal today, but it still one of the first movie with many of the things action movie need to be a success. It's the blueprint to any action movie today.",

96,9 May 2009,thesar-2,9, Die Happy,"Despite its flaws, 'Die Hard' remains as one of the best action films of all time. I've seen this movie dozens of times, and really enjoyed its sequels (aside from part 2, a la 'Indiana Jones 2.') This absolute classic set all the standards, or in better terms, clichés. So, if you watch this today, you might recognize a lot of the scenes, dialogue, ""surprises,"" but real ""die hard"" fans will see this started it all. Much like 'Halloween' really was the birth of the slasher film (others will dispute, but it really was Michael Myers that started the trends.) Unfortunately for the copy-cats, 'Die Hard' had an excellent villain (Rickman) and supporting cast. In addition, and most importantly, it had Bruce Willis who was, I've read, the bottom of the barrel choice of the producers and yet, contributed the most depth of ANY HERO of these 'Die Hard' rip offs. He had great lines, depth, realistic approach, was vulnerable, and simply human. As stated, despite its flaws (the white-to-green wife beater was solely a distraction and the fact two main characters seemed to just ride off in the sunset – yes, it was part of the storyline, but surely unrealistic to the rest of the ""it could really happen"" plot) 'Die Hard' was nearly perfect, and this was thanks to nearly perfect performances from Rickman and Willis. Not to mention the continuous and great action sequences. Basically, on Christmas Eve, Willis flies into LA from NYC to make good with wife only to help hostages during a heist. Only thing I would've done differently in Willis' role was, when he had the police on the secret radio, was to threatened the President. I'm sure that would've brought more than just the police. And $.74 gas? Wow, I love the 80s!",

The jig is up. But McClaine handed him an unloaded gun. Hans threatens McClaine, pulls the trigger and....click click click. Hans realizes the gun is unloaded, and just then the elevator opens and the rest of the terrorists come out guns blazing, leading to a new series of events that McClaine must overcome. In a lesser movie, a whole third of the film would be dedicated to John and Hans pretending to be an escaped hostage. It would have dragged the movie to a halt and added an unnecessary layer of suspense. But here, in Die Hard, the whole series of events takes 3-5 minutes, and then onto more action.

Die Hard really is action film-making at its best, and began a new type of actioner - the everyman caught in a unique situation - that many films would try to copy; some more successfully than others, but none would ever measure up to the original. That even includes the 4 (and counting) sequels! It would launch the careers of Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman skyward - admittedly on different trajectories - and even become a bizarrely popular choice for a seasonal festive film each December! John McClane (Willis) is a New York cop who has travelled to Los Angeles to reunite with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at a Christmas party in a city skyscraper, when an armed band of villains march in with machine guns and take over, led by Alan Rickman's evil Hans Gruber, holding the partygoers to ransom. McClane must then work his way through the building, picking off the terrorists one by one, fighting a one-man war while the LAPD pontificates impotently on the doorstep.",

Yippee-kiyay motherfu...well, you know the rest. John McClane. Nakatomi Plaza. Hans Gruber. Twinkies. ""Let it snow, let it snow, let it snoooow"". McTiernan's near-masterpiece is the epitome of 80s action and truly sets the bar high for future action films. It evolves the genre to new levels by balancing drama and character development with memorable explosions and a slew of gunfire. McClane visits his wife on her Christmas work party, when a group of terrorists hold them hostage for a large sum of money. But McClane doesn't sit down and roll over. Oh no, in typical cowboy fashion he targets the enemy. Luring them to their demise. Bang. You just got ""McClaned"". ""Thanks for the advice"". This isn't just an action film, don't be fooled by its overwhelming praise. Although justified, this is also actually a well balanced crime thriller. Gripping dialogue between McClane and Gruber allows both characters to have infectious personalities. The former being this New York loud mouth with a ludicrous amount of quippy lines and the latter being the commanding antagonist that withholds a sense of compromise. Their interactions, or lack of, was tangible. Then the police department and FBI get involved, but the development doesn't stop there. In fact, it just ramps up with the action. Aside from Argyle, who is just an obvious plot convenience, all the characters have natural inclusion to the story. The action was explosive and surprisingly bloody, particularly the rooftop C4 explosion. McTiernan's direction was perfect, crafting a perfectly paced narrative. Packed to the brim with memorability, from its antagonist and his slow-motion demise (Rickman was an absolute legend) to the various quotable lines of dialogue. This is a near-perfect film, and one that deserves the acclaim it has garnered. With excellent performances to boot from Willis and Rickman, there really are a limited amount of flaws (in fact hardly any). Merry Christmas McClane, merry frickin' Christmas!",

This movie also turned relatively unknown actor Bruce Willis into a big star instantly. Bruce was a different kind of action hero than Stallone or Schwarzenegger, being much more of an everyman than a jacked up killing machine. He plays a heavy duty cop caught in a building that is being taken over by terrorists that his wife is also held hostage by. This is really well done, nicely shot and put together. The story flows well with tons of great looking action scenes and explosions. The acting is also very solid with Bruce Willis truly rising to the occasion as leading man. Also, Alan Rickman gives a super strong cinematic debut as terrorist leader Hans Gruber, who is easily one of the best screen villains of all time. Hollywood tried copying this formula for years to come. I personally, don't like any of the sequels and the ripoffs like Speed, Cliffhanger and Con Air are pure crap in my opinion.

This first adventure by police officer John McClane became one of the great references of the genre. The rules of action cinema in Hollywood have been rewritten and experienced a welcome evolution in the three decades that followed the explosion of Die Hard. At first glance, Die Hard can be seen superficially as a film of an invincible army man, who ends up alone with a catastrophic terrorist assault that involves millions of dollars, a lot of shooting, blood and death.

It is also the best movie of Bruce Willis's career, and one of the few movies that I can honestly say that was worthy of sequels and follow-ups. Tough New York Cop may not be Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills, and indeed, this could be called Century City Cop. He's a New York cop in Los Angeles for the holidays, to visit his estranged wife and daughter, and when taken to the building where his wife is at a holiday party for her employer, he becomes involved in a hostage crisis headed by that villain of all villains, Alan Rickman, in the role that capitulated him to villain stardom.",

Willis' John McClane receives more sympathy from the audience because of his everyman quality. McClane seems like an ordinary guy caught up in an extraordinary situation and is doing whatever he can to save his wife and stop the bad guys. This more conventional character makes Die Hard much more engaging because most viewers can see themselves in the movie. Mix in John McTiernan's incredible directing, Alan Rickman's standard-setting villain, and sprinkle in some Christmas music and holiday cheer for extra flavor and you got yourself one of the greatest action movies in history and the best Christmas movie of all time (Don't fight me on it not being a Christmas movie, please.

116,30 September 2020,andrewnmiller,10, An action classic,"Back in 1968, 20th Century Fox released The Detective. Based on the book by Roderick Thorp and starring Frank Sinatra, the film was quite successful for the studio and Thorp would follow up with a sequel book in 1979 with the story following Sinatra's character named Joe Leland attending a Christmas party with his daughter when a group of German terrorists show up and take over the building. 20th Century Fox had expressed an interest in adapting the book into a film but given that Sinatra was obligated to appear in the film, he would have to be offered the part but with Frank being in his 70s, he turned the role down. There were rumors making the rounds for years that the film was going to be a recycled screenplay for the intended sequel to Commando but that was never the case. With Sinatra out of the picture, it gave them the chance to change the characters and remove the connection to the previous story. WIth Joel Silver producing and having worked with director John McTiernan on Predator, Joel felt he would be the right director to bring Die Hard to life. However, McTiernan didn't like the early drafts of the script and turned the offer down several times and only took the job after being convinced to do it. Feeling the screenplay to be too mean-spirited and wanting to lighten up the film a bit, McTiernan decided to add in humor so that the audience wouldn't despise the villians. John also didn't want the villians to be terrorists ether seeing that direction as too distasteful for a summer blockbuster so he decided to stay away from the terrorists' political views and focus more on them being professional thieves in search of financial gain feeling that this would make Die Hard more appropriate for moviegoers. When it came time to casting the lead for Die Hard, names like Harrison Ford and Clint Eastwood were offered the role of John McClane, but both of them turned the role down. Bruce Willis eventually got the role, seeing it as a chance to expand his acting range and do a different kind of film with Die Hard. Shooting began in November of 1987 and finished in March of 1988 with the 20th Cenrty Fox headquarters filling in for Nakatomi Plaza. When the film was released in the summer of 1988, It wasn't well-received by film critics but it still did well at the box office.

I'm only 29 but I think it is one of the best action movies ever made also. Whenever I think about what the standards are that an action movie should live up to in terms of craftsmanship, this is a movie that comes straight to mind. I also think of it when considering what a great action protagonist should be like. He or she is not invincible but can hold their own. They also should be likeable and relatable on some level. Enter John McClane, played flawlessly by Bruce Willis. My favorite performance of his is in this movie. I love Bonnie Bedelia, as his wife Holly McClane. I love Reginald VelJohnson as Al Powell, who would coincidentally go on to play another cop in a long-running sitcom where he was the neighbor of a kid who always ""did that"" (one of my favorite shows). I don't think anybody misses a beat in this movie. That leads me to the late, great Alan Rickman. He inhabited the role of terrorist Hans Gruber. An unforgettable performance by Rickman. He is every bit as strong of a villain as John McClane is as a hero. The odds are certainly against John as he has to square up against 12 terrorists as a lone man on the inside, while they are taking people hostage. The action, acting, editing, sound and the musical score are all wonderful. I'm not a filmmaker but if I were John McTiernan I would most certainly be proud to say that I made this movie right here. McTiernan also directed the 3rd film ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" which was also fantastic. And while I also enjoy ""Die Hard 2"" and ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (which I find underrated BTW, particularly the unrated cut), McClane works best when McTiernan is in charge.

He jumps off the roof and falls through air ducts. He uncovers deception and double-cross and picks broken glass out of his bare feet. No help comes from the naive and incompetent police, who are unable to get inside, and even less from the FBI. McClane is not a super cop. He is an ordinary guy, who doesn't want a fight. When he is shot, he bleeds. He hurts. All he has are his pants, his vest, his gun - which runs out of ammo. This is the first realistic connection the audience has. When you don't want to be in McClane's position, it makes for much excitement. John McTiernan, who's only previous mainstream movie was Predator, uses awesome photography and technical skills to give the film a truly polished and sophisticated look - it was nominated for four technical Academy Awards.

143,9 April 2016,matthewssilverhammer,9, McClane / Gruber Death Match,"It's no secret that Die Hard is as thrilling, fun, and cool as a movie can get; and those superlatives all describe Willis's John McClane. He has what all heroes should have: relatability, brains, and wry sense of humor to-boot. The now iconic glass-plagued-feet are a perfect visual for what makes Die Hard stand out. Instead of just another god-like protagonist, we get a reminder of his intact humanity, whose stakes never let us believe he's invincible. On the other side is Hans Gruber. Rickman's villain set the tone for action villains for the 20th and 21st centuries. He has what all villains should have: clear motive and ineffable charisma. Like McClane, he's not just a towering beefcake; his strength is his charm, his lies speaking directly to modern fears of terrorism. This was the anti-Schwarzenegger/anti-Stallone punch-n-gun-fest; it was an unassuming thriller, known as much for its smirk and wit as its brawn. Not that these two characters are the only great aspects in the film. The script is tight, the editing is sharp, the action is tense and the humor never misses a beat. But the head-to-head, McClane-Gruber enigmatic death match is what has implanted this forever in the zeitgeist. It may be sacrilege to watch this apart from the Christmas season, but regardless of what is decking the halls, it would be more of a shame to miss seeing this in theaters. Let's send a message, that we want well-constructed and thoughtful action flicks, not lazy money-grabs (I'm looking at you, Batman and Superman).",

It also surprises us with its well-constructed script and its perfect pacing which remains consistent and easy to follow throughout the whole film. The movie is not perfect though because of the marriage conflict with McClane and his wife. It's great for an action movie to have a character development but I found it to be uninteresting. But this is a minor complaint on my part. Overall, this movie is fantastic. It's super entertaining and it has influenced many later action films.

The iconic taunt by hotshot NYC cop John Mcclane to the terrorists he's evading in a gigantic LA high rise that's under siege. This is the prototype, patient x, the catalyst for an army of homages, imitations, sequels and an entire subculture of action movie mania. It's got few bells or whistles, nothing too extravagant like a lot of the CGI laden PG-13 crap that masquerades as action these days (I'm looking at you Expendables 3), just a good old fashioned, down n' dirty piece of bloody holiday fun with one of the most exciting set ups in any flick of the genre. Bruce Willis has probably never been better as the wise cracking, amusingly self deprecating tough guy who wants nothing to do with the situation, just wants to reconnect with his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) on Christmas Eve and take it easy. The extremists have other ideas, though, ruthlessly taking the skyscraper she works in hostage and locking it down like Fort Knox. Mcclane cunningly infiltrates it, and the bone crunching, bullet spraying Yuletide joy takes off, hardly letting up for a minute. Mcclane is both helped and hindered by law enforcement outside the building, including sympathetic beat cop Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) idiotic Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson (Paul Gleason) and interfering FBI Agents Big (Robert Davi) and Little (Grand L. Bush) Johnson. The Christmas wreath for best performance of the film has to go to Alan Rickman though. He so rarely shows up in fun genre stuff like this, and his presence always chromes up whatever the film is to perfection. He plays absolutely evil German psychopath Hans Gruber, leader of the terrorists and bane of Mcclane's existence, just the rotten murdering bastard you hope to see in the villain slot in every film like this. The shining example that all action films should aspire to be, the zenith of slam bang flicks, and a good dose of Christmas cheer too. Yippee ki yay motherfvcker",

But when we get right down to it, Die Hard is so great simply because it's a tightly constructed, kick-ass action film that barely pauses a moment to let you breathe once it gets rolling. It may not have created the contemporary action template, but it certainly did a lot to cement it.

Mind you quote what the body-count here contributes to the season of goodwill to all men is open to interpretation. Still, for thrills, stunts and spectacle ""Die Hard"" certainly delivers, less so for characterisation, plot and credibility, although I suppose it was ever thus for action blockbusters like this. Bruce Wilis advances into the heavyweight corner with his performance here, even if his wise-cracking persona seems to have carried over from ""Moonlighting"", although where he picked up his pliability and durability along the way, again is anybody's guess. I liked Willis in ""Moonlighting"" so it's not surprising I like him here. His John McClane is capable it seems of startling feats of death-defying derring-do, but at least he gets there from an inauspicious start when he initially seems terrified and clueless as to how to cope with the heist situation. He squares off well against smooth, metronomic, but sadistic Alan Rickman, in his first big movie role, as the robber's leader proves a good foil. The stunts are excellent, although the soundtrack and fashions have dated poorly. Nevertheless, the action steams ahead from almost the start and rarely lets up thereafter, Bruce working his way through what looks like a bunch of try-outs for 80's hairbands. At various points I picked up on Christmas in the background, even if the film as a whole has little to do with the traditional festive spirit . Still, I watched it all the way through and even though I'm more a Jimmy Stewart /Cary Grant man around this time of year, I can see how it came to define a whole sub-genre of 80's blockbuster.",

It is all the more perfect for how the industry basically thought it was going to be a dud at the time it was produced. If you don't have respect for that film watch the Netflix series 'The Movies That Made Us' and you will have a whole new appreciation for it. I loved it before and I love it even more after realizing how tenuous the production was. It launched Bruce Willis as an action hero, as well as Alan Rickman's prolific film career. John McClane is just the right amount of badass and vulnerable while cracking wise as he battles it out with terrrorists, and Rickman's Hans Gruber is a masterful portrayal of a truly devious enemy that has gone down as one of the best movie villains of all time. It is one of the most quotable movies I can think of and is a Christmas staple as far as I am concerned. Along with 'Lethal Weapon' it made fallible heroes popular as well as revitalizing, or reinvigorating, the buddy action film. If there is any flaw it did severely dumb down law enforcement besides Willis' McClane and his buddy on the outside Reginald VelJohnson's Al Powell. To be fair though they needed to under perform in order to make the rest of the story work so I feel it is forgivable and has actually become a trope for these types of films. From the plot to the cast to the script to the direction every element in this film just fits so perfectly. This is one of those movies that just feels like a given, like a constant.

However, this one, I suspect, is one of the first of this kind, if not the first. It's also by far the best of this kind. This one set the bar for action films to come, and most of the cliches from films of this kind actually originated in this one. It has the perfect mix of humor, action and thriller. Bruce Willis is perfect as the wisecracking action-hero, and Reginald VelJohnson is great as the cop, and Alan Rickman is excellent as the terrorist leader. The plot is great, probably the best I've seen in this type of action film. It keeps a fairly good pace throughout the film, except for just a few scenes which lack intensity, but maybe that's just because I've seen it so many times, and know what happens. The acting is almost flawless. The humor is great, Bruce Willis redefines wisecracking with his funny remarks throughout the film. The action is intense, on a great scale and well-filmed, which is what you'd expect when the director is John McTiernan, who is quite experienced in making great action films. All in all, a great action film, definitely the best of its kind, and should be enjoyable to just about anyone who just mildly enjoys action films. I recommend it to fans of action films in general, but specifically for fans of this particular sub-genre. 8/10",

When McClane visits Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at her company's Christmas party a group of radical criminals take control of the skyscraper.

Unbeknownst to him a group of German terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) plan on crashing the party and stealing $640 million dollars in bearer bonds. McClane gets away when the terrorists take people at the party hostage and basically the movie is him trying to take out the terrorists as well as communicating with a cop.

201,19 September 2007,rickhavoc1,10, The Action Masterpiece that Redefined the Genre,"This is the action movie that redefined the genre, spawned a host of imitations, and launched Bruce Willis to international super-stardom. He also redefined the action hero, along with Mel Gibson. John McLane (Willis) comes to L.A. to spend Christmas with his family and try to reconcile with his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who took their children there to advance her career. Why is it that when a woman breaks up her marriage to advance her career it's admirable, but if a man does it, he's an insensitive JERK? (Personally, I see this as a prime example of feminist/liberal hypocrisy. Then they have the nerve to accuse MEN of having double standards!) Anyway, he goes to meet her at a Christmas party at her office, and gets mad at her when he finds out she's using her maiden name. As he's berating himself in the private room for starting an argument with her, a gang of thieves come in, kill all the guards, cut off all outside communications, take everyone at the party hostage, and try to get the head honcho, Joseph Takagi (James Shigeta), to give them the access code to the security vault so they can steal $650 million worth of bearer bonds. When he tells the ringleader, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), that he doesn't know the access code, which changes every day, Hans blows his brains out, with John hiding in the room watching. We soon come to know that Hans has the most dangerous combination of traits, high intelligence and total amorality. He then proceeds with his plan, which is to PRETEND to be terrorists, because he's studied the FBI's terrorist response plan, and intends to use it to help them break into the security vault. I'm not going to reveal much more of the plot. Instead I'm going to discuss how Bruce changed the character of the action hero forever, and showed great acting ability in the process. Previously, action heroes had generally been portrayed as fearless one dimensional characters who were so tough they could go through anything and anybody who stood in their way with hardly a scratch. To give them credit, both Arnold and Sly tried to give some of their characters added depth, but neither of them had really developed the range to be convincing at that stage of their careers. Bruce broke the mold by portraying John McLane as a normal guy who happened to be a police detective caught up in an abnormal situation. At first he's frightened and tries to get some outside help, but when he realizes the thieves are controlling all outside communication, he uses his brains to become the ""..fly in the ointment. The monkey in the wrench. The pain in the a$$."" to both disrupt the thieves' planned timetable and get them angry. Because he knows that the angrier he makes them, the less clearly they'll be able to think, and the more they'll concentrate on trying to kill him instead of sticking to their plan. He also knows this'll give him the chance to whittle down the opposition. He also shows vulnerability, fallibility, frustration, pain, anguish, and determination. He also uses a good deal of profanity, but it's never gratuitous. He uses it to control his own fear and to put his enemies even further off balance. I understand that Bruce ad-libbed many of his one-liners.",
202,28 December 2018,theterminator-92378,10, The Best Action Movie Ever And Definitely A Christmas Movie,"Die Hard is 80s action movies in a nutshell but what Die Hard does is bring us a action packed story with Drama, Romance and gore and swearing obviously Bruce Willis cements himself as a action star alongside Sly and Arnie and out of all of the Die Hard movies this is the most solid in the series.
Die Hard follows NYPD detective John McClane on holiday to visit his distant wife who lives with there children in Los Angeles and when he arrives at a Christmas party at Nakatomi Plaza armed terrorists lead by the well dressed and well educated Hans Gruber he is a man with a plan and he will pull off the ultimate heist if it wasn't for the New York cop with a plan.
The superb cast is lead by leading man Bruce Willis who plays the hero cop John McClain he wasn't orginaly the first pick to play the part so i'm glad that they picked him he was absolutly perfect in this role. Reginald VelJohnson is another star he plays Sgt Al Powell A desk jockey cop who is the first cop to respond and the emotional and moral support of John and throughout he is the only one who cares about John and we also learn his story about how he shot a kid and he was never right after that and we can sympathise with his character. Another amazing talent is Bonnie Bedelia who plays Holly Gennaro McClane she is so badass standing up for herself and not being scared of Hans and his goons and she has a lot of faith in her husband to take out the terrorists and she uses her intellegence to keep herself alive and she is such a great character. I can't talk about Die Hard without talking about the main bad guy himself Hans Gruber played by the always amazing Alan Rickman he is just so amazing if you have seen Die Hard you know this guy needs no explaination of why he is great and he is one of the best movie villians of all time.
also in the cast is Paul Gleason {Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson}, William Atherton {Richard Thornburg}, Hart Bochner {Harry Ellis}, James Shigeta {Joseph Yoshinobu Takagi}, Alexander Godunov {Karl},De'voreaux White {Argyle},Bruno Doyon {Franco} and Clarence Gilyard Jr. {Theo}.
What is there really to say about Die Hard it's a instant classic and spawned a whole franchise and other simular movies that are not as good as Die Hard is a movie that if you have not seen than you should it's a movie that everyone should watch around Christmas because it is a christmas movie and it's a great movie that you shouldn't miss out on watching and I would very strongly recomend this movie.",

214,16 June 2005,jboothmillard,10, Die Hard,"From director John McTiernan (Predator) comes the first of the highly popular action thriller films with the star of Moonlighting (in his third film, after two failures). It is Christmas Eve, and John McClane (Bruce Willis) has arrived in Los Angeles to see his wife Holly Gennaro McClane (Bonnie Bedelia) who along with his kids he has not seen for six months. Her promotion is what brought her from New York to LA, and she had to move to work in the Nakatomi Plaza, a 40 story building. She has to do a speech at the party going on, and she leaves the room saying she'll be back, and a few minutes later, a group of German terrorists led by mastermind Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his right-hand man Karl (Alexander Godunov) enter the building and take everyone on the 30th floor hostage. John manages to get away and hide in the upper building, still under construction, and the terrorists have no idea he is there. Hans takes Holly's boss Joseph Yashinobo Takagi (James Shigeta) and demands he give him the computer code to open the building's safe to steal $640,000,000 in bearer bonds, and Takagi is killed when he refuses, which John witnesses. Technology expert Theo (Clarence Gilyard Jr.) is told to start working on getting the safe opened, which he thinks will take a couple of hours, John meanwhile is trying to alert the LAPD, because the phone lines have been cut. Once the police are there, they prove incompetent under the command of arrogant deputy chief Dwayne T. Robinson (The Breakfast Club's Paul Gleason), and only Sergeant Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) on the walkie talkie supports him, so John has to save the hostages alone. There is one part where John meets Hans face to face, but he believes for a tiny while he is a hostage, because he puts on an American accent. Eventually, John manages to help the hostages, stop the robbery, and confront Hans who is holding his wife#s bracelet, but he does fall to his death eventually. Also starring De'Voreaux White as Argyle, William Atherton as Richard Thornburg, Hart Bochner as Harry Ellis, The Living Daylights' Andreas Wisniewski as Tony, Licence to Kill's Robert Davi as Agent Johnson and Grand L. Bush as Agent Johnson. Filled with fantastic action and stunts (some done by Willis himself), great acting, a humorous, wise cracking and admirable hero in the wrong place at the wrong time, a cunning villain, and the great catchphrase, ""Yippee-ki-yay, mother f***er"", this is an essential action thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Bruce Willis was number 35 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Hans Gruber was number 46 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and the film was number 39 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Outstanding!",
215,22 December 2022,Uriah43,8, A Remarkable Action Film,"This movie begins with a New York cop by the name of ""John McClane"" (Bruce Willis) arriving in Los Angeles to spend some time with his estranged wife ""Holly Gennaro-McClane"" (Bonnie Bedilia) and their two children during the Christmas holidays. Upon making his way through the airport, he is greeted by a limousine driver by the name of ""Argyle"" (De'voreaux White) who has been hired by his wife's company to take him to a party being held in their high-rise corporate office. Once there, he is greeted by the manager of the company ""Mr. Takagi"" (James Shigeta) along with Holly and a couple of her colleagues. Not long afterward, he goes to the washroom to freshen up and while he's away from those at the party, a dozen terrorists enter the building armed with all kinds of weaponry and proceed to take everyone hostage--everyone except John, that is, who is also armed and intends to free the hostages no matter what it takes. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was an outstanding action film which, even though it is a bit long, kept my attention from start-to-finish. I especially liked the acting of Alan Rickman (as the terrorist leader ""Hans Gruber"") who was a perfect fit for the role along with that of the aforementioned Bruce Willis as well. In any case, I recommend this film for those looking for a good, action-packed film during the holiday season. It's quite remarkable.",
216,21 December 2006,anchorman360,10, My Favorite Action Movie,This is by far the most exciting action movie I have ever seen. There is a lot of shooting and things that get blown up. This movie was Bruce Willis's first big movie. He stars as John Mcclane a New York cop who flies to LA to see his Wife and kids for Christmas. Then while people are taken hostage by the bad guys Mcclane escapes and starts shooting the terrorists one at a time. My favorite part was when Mcclane throws a chair with c-4 on it down the elevator shaft and a big part of the building blows up. This movie has been copied a lot but is still very fun to watch. Alan Rickman plays the leader of the bad guys and is very scary. I also enjoyed the two sequels and I am really looking to the Fourth one coming out in 2007. A definite 10 out of 10,
217,23 March 2012,fredericksmith1952,10, Dirty Harry with an attitude!,"Okay, so who am I to argue with success? Obviously this franchise has proved immensely popular, given the further proliferation of Die Hards 2, 3, & 4. John McClane is Willis' most popular character, and a natural extension of his role in the television series Moonlighting with Cybil Sheppard. McClane is a street cop, a no-nonsense, shoot first ask questions later police officer who apparently gets the job done in the style of Dirty Harry. Alan Rickman is exceptional as Hans Gruber, the ex-terrorist with aspirations of becoming wealthy no matter how many lives are lost. As in most McTiernan action films, there is little background or lead in, just enough to let you know who the players are, and the action quickly starts and barely pauses. Bonnie Bedelia is excellent in her role as Holly Gennero, the top executive with people skills and a sense for reasonable control. She is the perfect executive who thinks of her people first and attempts to maintain calm under duress. Alexander Godunov plays Karl, the hot-headed terrorist on a mission to kill McClane for killing his brother. While no one will ever consider the Die Hards as Oscar worthy films, they are fun and exciting, and definitely collectible. Rated R for some brief nudity, drug use, and a whole lot of gratuitous violence. Like Vin said in xXx, ""....think Playstation...Blow s*&t up!""",
218,8 July 2005,Aaron1375,9, A very effective action movie.,"This is one of those movies so effective in its delivery that it almost makes you uncomfortable to watch. You have your cop in a giant office building that has been overrun with high tech bank robbers posing as terrorist, and his wife is one of the hostages. Not only that, but the poor guy doesn't have any shoes which really makes an uncomfortable scene when the glass starts to fly. Willis is great as the lead character and Rickman does an excellent job as the bad guy as does the other guy who was a Russian dancer or something before defecting here. Great performances by the other members of the cast as well. The action is great, though at times they really seem to be throwing it at our hero and things seem to be going badly. Many memorable action scenes including the roof explosion and McClain (Willis) swinging to safety on a fire hose, his many encounters with said villains and a particularly good ending with the main villain. Don't think it is all action however, as Bruce Willis adds some comedy by means of very funny quips that add a lot to the flick. Still though at its heart it is an action movie first and the action comes fast and furious.",

And he is a sarcastic guy that ticks off the bad guys and has punchlines but he is still a likable badass. He even gets bloodied up and bruised up during the process. Unlike those Steven Seagal movies where he hardly had a scratch after taking on dozens or even tons of bad guys. The build up is good and when the action kicks in, it's entertaining from start to finish. In fact this is probably the movie that really kick started Bruce Willis's career in the film industry as John McClane. The whole movie, well most of the action at least takes place within a tall building. And it's cool to see John McClane using every resource he has to fight the villains that takes over the building and holds onto hostages. And it's entertaining to see how everything plays out. Even the main villain Hans Gruber who is the leader of the pack played by Alan Rickman.

But Die Hard in my opinion is the best of them all. The Main Character is great. He's relatable and likable and he's not a superhero, in fact he gets his butt kicked constantly throughout the movie. The Villain is also great. The Late Alan Rickman does a fantastic job playing this character. The action scenes are quite brutal and violent but very realistic. The humour is hilarious with some of the best one liners in cinema history. My only real problem with this movie is some of the supporting characters, mainly the police. Most of them are incredibly annoying and it gets so irritating when they constantly don't believe anything the main character is telling them about the terrorists. But even with that Die Hard is still my favorite action film of the 80s(And my favorite Christmas movie too).",
238,14 August 2008,mrmoviefreak261-1,10, Die Hard-probably the best action film of all time,"I praise this movie just because it's a great action film. And it has great acting which makes it a classic. And so on. John McClane. After watching this movie, that's a person you would like to become. It starts with John McClane flying into California to see his wife in a tall forty-story skyscraper. He's a New York cop, and of course he's confused and disgusted with the California mood and humor. Then the terrorists arrive. Coincidence that it's the same night John McClane has arrived. John sneaks out unnoticed and tries to save all the Californian hostages and his wife from the death-threatening terrorists. He's a cop, so he has skill. Another good thing about this movie is that most of it is believable. Some can disagree, but for the most part, it's pretty realistic. Die Hard is both violent, which is good for this film, has lots of cursing, which some people can find unnecessary, but I think it's great, and the movie is sometimes humorous. I enjoyed watching this movie, just because it's good. Just plain good.",

Hans Gruber is just an utterly iconic character, and Alan Rickman nails his role. He is menacing, funny and cool all in one, and he makes the film so much more entertaining to watch. This is nothing against Bruce Willis who is great in his role too - I was just surprised as to how the villain ended up being the best part. The action is also just straight entertaining to watch. Films like this don't really require too much analysis because they are made to be a tonne of fun, and that's exactly what this is. The action is just really well choreographed and just damn awesome to watch, and it's the action, more than the decent story and fairly well developed emotional beats, that made me enjoy this film.

243,16 July 2006,euqamratz,10, Action Packed From Start To Stop,"I'm a great fan of Bruce Willis and the fifty odd films which he has starred in, but his role as John McLane in the ""Die Hard"" series would have to be on the top of my list for the best Bruce Willis movie of all time. After watching and probably enjoying the film immensely, you realize how corny, but good the film was. The first few action sequences involve the ultimate bad guy, Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman in one of his more solid performances) and are great viewing. They really do set the tone for the rest of the movie, and even for the sequels to follow. But these first few scenes are upstaged by the brilliance of Bruce Willis in his many fight scenes, usually involving gunfire, glass breaking or some kind of explosion! These scenes are enjoyable and all lead to the explosive finale, which leads to a chopper going down, the roof of a building exploding, and a man falling 70 stories to his death. There's also plenty of comic relief in this film, with Argyle, McLanes' limo driver, being oblivious to the anarchy occurring above him whilst he is in the underground car park listening to music and chatting up ladies. Officer Powell, McLanes sidekick outside of the building, also provides a few good laughs. But the two main performances of Willis and Rickman take up mos of the screen time, and rightfully so, as these two characters are brilliant to watch. The Plot line is quite good for such an action-packed film, and it doesn't ever lose any of the intensity it starts out with, if it doesn't gain any that is! All in all, this is a film I recommend for anyone who doesn't take films too seriously, or just wants a good action packed film. Definitely one to put into your DVD or video collection at home.",

Bruce Willis' character John McClain is the epitome of the American hero, a man who stands alone against evil and conquers it by his own strength, character, determination and skill. I'm sure that's why this series of movies has been so popular: we all feel overwhelmed these days with crime, terrorism, the loss of some of our freedoms and few heroes to look up to. Alan Rickman, in one of his finest movie roles, is the perfect villain: smart, cunning, greedy and ruthless. His cohorts, built for brawn and used as fodder, are great in their roles. The computer nerd is funny, intelligent and completely without a conscience. I love the limo driver; he gives just the right amount of comic relief in an overwhelmingly violent movie.

Die Hard,"" and it stars Bruce Willis in another one of those Hollywood action roles where the hero's shirt is ripped off in the first reel so you can see how much time he has been spending at the gym. He's a New York cop who has flown out to Los Angeles for Christmas, and we quickly learn that his marriage was put on hold after his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) left for the Coast to accept a great job offer. They, too, are a multinational group, led by a German named Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) who is well-dressed and has a neatly trimmed beard and talks like an intellectual and thinks he is superior to the riffraff he has to associate with. He has a plan that has been devised with clockwork precision involving the theft of millions of dollars in negotiable bonds, and it is only after Willis starts causing trouble that he is forced to take the Nakatomi employees as hostages. But then the filmmakers introduce a gratuitous and unnecessary additional character: the deputy police chief (Paul Gleason), who doubts that the guy on the other end of the radio is really a New York cop at all. Without the deputy chief and all that he represents, ""Die Hard"" would have been a more than passable thriller. With him, it's a mess, and that's a shame, because the film does contain superior special effects, impressive stunt work and good performances, especially by Rickman as the terrorist.

279,9 June 2002,F0RCE,9, The film that defined a genre.,"""Die Hard"" is a film that defined a film genre.  Critics and film fans alike have looked to this film as one of the most influential films in recent years.  This film literally has it all.  Not only does ""Die Hard"" give us an incredibly charismatic hero, but also villians that the audience loves to hate, an underlying love theme, action, comedy, and special effects that were very well done.  The look and feel of ""Die Hard"" emerged from brilliant director John McTiernan.  At its core the plot seems to revolve around one cop's crusade to defend innocent civilians against terrorists.  However with this film the viewer must take a step back and look deeper into the film. In this film fan's opinion ""Die Hard"" is based on love.  John McClane's love for his estranged wife is his motivation to go on and survive.  McClane, our hero is portrayed in an interesting way.  McClane is an incredibly vulnerable man.  He takes unfathomable amounts of punishment and continues to go right at the terrorists.  The broken glass in his feet, the numerous cuts and burns and the various beatings handed to him have not deterred his fight.  McClane's battle is similar to that of Rocky Balboa who competed so dramatically against Apollo Creed, because of the strength and encouragement from his woman.  This love theme should not however overshadow the achievement of this film in terms of special effects, plot, and directing. McTiernan crafted an amazing picture that not only kept the audience guessing but also tells a story with characters the viewer can associate with.  From the beginning of the film the audience is immediately supporting McClane.  This film should be recognized not only as a an action film with great fight scenes and incredible special effects but also a story about love, determination, and the human spirit.",

It is the template for modern day action films: the humdrum introduction of the movie's hero and his boring backstory (separated from wife and family, yadda yadda yadda), the minor characters that will factor in later on, the deliberate setup of relationships before the action begins, then enter the bad guys and the fun begins! I can't believe this, but 20 years ago when DIE HARD first came out, I thought no way would this work with Bruce Willis as the 'action' hero! This was the smarmy, smug guy from the TV show MOONLIGHTING for Chr*st's sake! But Willis totally rocks! He is so effortless in his portrayal of New York cop John McClane. You really feel like he IS John McClane. It's really one of the most underrated performances that I can remember!

281,18 November 2020,SebMoz,10, The ultimate action classic,"Ah yes, the original Die Hard. So much has been said about this movie, and almost everyone acknowledges its importance for the action genre, myself included. This isn't just a fun action movie that you can watch and enjoy, even though it is that as well. This movie surpasses almost all other action movies from the 80's in terms of writing and structure. The plot is simple and easy to follow, and nothing is being kept secret from us, which means it's easier to get a grasp of the situation. It's also very well paced, with just the right balance between action and dialogue. The movie is also very well directed and edited. However, the biggest strength of the movie are the characters. John McClane is practically the perfect protagonist. He's well fleshed out, he's sympathetic, he's funny , while also being both a complete badass AND vulnrable at the same time. Bruce Willis obviously contributed a lot to this character, it's wouldn't have worked nearly as well with someone else. The villain, played excellently by the late Alan Rickman, is almost equally great. He's a cold-blooded murderer and very menacing while also being very sophisticated and super enjoyable to watch and listen to. The movie's best scenes are arguably the ones where The hero, the villain and the concerned cop outside of the building talkto each other over the radio, it is an excellent way of letting them interact without actually meeting in person, as having them meet would cause the movie to lose a sense of realism. The rest of the cast also does an incredible job, there is no weak link in it. The movie also feels like a mature and very violent action movie, which is something I miss in today's film industry. There is a lot of gore and swearing, and this just adds to the gritty sense of realism the movie presents so brilliantly.

Both Alan Rickman and Bruce Willis give their best performances. The thing about them is that they weren't that big back in the day and now they are big. Alan Rickman really can act, and he knows how to pick films. Bruce Willis also. Both actors are fantastic and make the movie alone, though the film is fantastic without them. Die hard has spectacular action sequences and good dialogue for an action film. Die hard is by far one of my favorite films ever, and I think that you should see it. If you dare say that you haven't. Otherwise, you'll be chased by an angry mob.",

This high-tech action thriller, based on a very good novel by Roderick Thorp, is a classic in its own way on account of the fact that it has revolutionized and influenced generations of action-buddy movies and is still mimicked and studied to this day. Apart from spawning three sequels, ""Die Hard"" is also a source of the most memorable lines in movie history, it introduced the great Alan Rickman to the screen, and unlike say ""Commando"" (1985), is a believable action movie with only a handful of moments were disbelief needs to be suspended.",

These components include such great moments like, Nakatomi Tower, ""shoot the glass"", the Christmas movie debate and Twinkies, which are just a few of the great moments taken from this film. It is a fun thrill-ride of comic book style action, with a plot juicy enough for a film like this. It is one of the great contributors to the action, crime, drama boom of the 1980s.

294,20 August 2006,dantheLAD,10, original and best,"a truly awesome action movie which should provide the outline for all Acton movies. surely no one dislikes this film? Surely? Well done Mr Mclaine for giving me many happy times pretending to be a kick ass cop as a kid while blowing away imaginary terrorists with my home made machine gun. Also nice visual effects for its time including the ""brains on the window"" scene. Fair enough the story line is not so original but who cares when an action film is this entertaining and that many people are killed in one night, inside one building by one man. I don't dislike the other two but think it was too much to ask to create two more genius films like this one!",
295,23 March 2006,volsdic,10, Welcome to the party pal,"This was a great start for Bruce Willis. This movie all started with John Mcclane on his Christmas vacation from New York to Los Angles to visit his wife Holly, which they were separated. John and Holly had an argument about their marriage. All of a sudden, while Holly was having a meeting, the German terrorist took over the plaza. The way how those terrorist planed their attack was incredible. All because of Theo, he know how to use computers and shutting off the elevators. And Karl played by Alexander Godunov, I had my eyes on him the way how he look suspicious with his long hair. Alan Rickman was the right actor to play as Hans Gruber, the way how he did that German ascent. As soon John accidentally killed Karl's brother during their fight all things broke lose with him, the part when Karl said "" I want blood"". The only part was so stupid was when Ellis trying to be a hero claiming to be John's friend. Ellis should of known that Hans was really going to kill him. I liked the way how John handled the terrorist situation as a New York cop. Reginald Veljohnson played as Sargent Al Powell stole the movie too. Such as, the way how Sargent Powell trusted John Mcclane, standing up for himself against Executive Chief Duane T. Robinson,including in the ending when held up his gun and shot down Karl. I also like the part when John and Hans finally met when Hans was acting like a hostage and claiming that he works for Neketomi. I think that was a challenging part for the director to put those two together. The best fight in Die Hard was John and Karl, I enjoyed that fight. All the lines in Die Hard were never broken by another movie. Such as, "" welcome to the party pal"". and "" I came by to the Christmas party by mistake who knew"".",
296,5 June 2013,tbills2,10, Die Hard is way better than good.,"Die Hard isn't the ordinary makeup of your everyday action flick. It has real guts and glory. Die Hard's well-structured all throughout and its foremost purpose is to deliver spectacular action in an innovative, raw approach, flipping the script on action movies forever. N.Y. cop John McClane is not your typical action star. Unlike most prior portrayals of action heroes (Rambo, RoboCop, Dirty Harry) John McClane doesn't stroll around with his machine gun killing off bad guys with some superhuman-like ability almost as if he's hitting targets popping out at a shooting range like the bad guys are trying to get shot. McClane methodically engages in combat using his entire equipped arsenal to emerge the victor, with the imminent threat of danger always lurking just around the bend. McClane manages to keep himself in constant peril, time and time over escaping certain death with an all too resourceful determination. Die Hard is incredible for it, for its realistic display of action. McClane matching against Hans and his band of terrorists is the weight and the overwhelming strength of Die Hard. Bruce Willis explodes onto the scene in the best role of his career. Alan Rickman is especially apt at playing a cold, calculating villain. It does a solid job of introducing the characters John McClane and Holly Gennaro, played by Bonnie Bedelia who is always fine to see, but the beginning seems uncertain of how to move through into the action. The beginning does do a good job though of setting the tone, giving you time to reflect and prepare for what mayhem lies ahead, time to get your popcorn ready. Once the terrorists enter the Nakatomi Plaza skyscraper, Die Hard starts to elevate to a high level not only in its entertainment value but in critical regard as well. It contains sharp editing and writing, having a number of good lines. Yippee-ki-yay. At the very end, the long, blonde haired German terrorist, you know, the guy from The Money Pit, he comes back to life badder than ever still well holding his deadly assault weapon as he tries at one last shot at McClane. Luckily, Sgt. Powell is there to save the day allowing Powell his moment of glory. This was an uncharacteristically tacky moment for this mostly masterful film, but Die Hard had already perfectly proved its worth by this point, so a little something for the kids doesn't hurt. Reginald VelJohnson is always acting as a cop, I like him for that. When you're watching Die Hard it will start picking up and it will keep getting better and keep getting better up until the very last scene when at which point your body will then need to be pried out from your seat. Die Hard is one of the all-time very best action movies, and it's all pure action. It's awesome.",

There was a lot of attention to detail in the film. Bruce Willis acquires injuries, and stays injured throughout the rest of the film - this is actually impressive for the 1980's action genre.

There's good dialogue, great stunts, great special effects, and in my opinion the plot ain't half bad. How can you not love Bruce Willis's wise cracking cop under pressure.

Guns, explosions, stunts, fights yes, as well as plenty of one-liners all wrapped around the familiar 'one man against the bad guys' plot, and set inside a sky-scraper. Considerably more clever than most action films, thanks mainly to the script, we find ourselves cheering for McClane rather than simply sitting back and waiting for him to sweep up the bad guys. Rickman is perfect, shifting between being charming to being psychotic, innocent, whatever he wants to be, and Willis deals with the action and one-liners admirably. Veljohnson and Willis' relationship is just one of the many reasons for the film's unexpected success. McTiernen is an expert in this genre, and directs action better than anyone else in the period. Although the sequels are good, they could not match the action, claustrophobia, tension and charm of the original. 9 out of 10",

The stunts have punchy impact and there seem to be very few computer effects used. Some of the peripheral characters are quintessentially 1980s, firmly placing die hard as a period movie for me. There are some cliche stereotypes especially the European bad guys and it has a very male macho feel, with very little for the few female characters to do.

367,13 December 2019,RhapsodyReviews,10, Standard for Action Films.,"Review:
'Die Hard' is a 1988 American action thriller film directed by John McTiernan. It is based on Roderick Thorp's novel 'Nothing Lasts Forever',
This is the ultimate standard when it comes to action movies. 'Die Hard' is a beloved action film and it's easy to see why.
The film follows off-duty New York City Police Department officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) who is caught in a Los Angeles skyscraper during a heist led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman).
The acting on all accounts is pretty close to perfect, even by the side characters. Although you do go to this movie to see Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane. He's a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders, but McClane's also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure. He is more than the stereotypical tough guy hero. Alan Rickman's performance as Hans Gruber went down in history as one of the greatest villains portray in an action movie and will continue to do so for a long time.
As I was writing this, I was thinking to myself that I didn't want to give it a 5-star rating. But, there simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film. Is ""Die Hard"" one of the best overall movies ever made? Probably not. But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made.
Overall, I forgot how much I loved this movie and I'm so glad I revisited it for the holiday season. I'm definitely adding this one to my collection, and I highly recommend it to t=all movie lovers.
5/5",

You see Willis running around in, what can only be described as, a vest and bare feet. Alan Rickman puts on a fantastic performance as, German terrorist leader, Hans Gruber - Check out the accent! This is by far the best work by John McTeirnan who has seemed to have gone down hill since doing Die Hard Three but will hopefully bounce back with some more great directing. Die Hard is one of the best films that can be watched over and over again. Die Hard two and three don't quite compare to the original but are worth a look.",

372,30 July 2015,anaconda-40658,7, Die Hard for Die Hard Fans.,"Die Hard (1988): Dir: John McTiernan / Cast: Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Reginald VelJohnson, Bonnie Bedelia, Alexander Godunov: When a cop arrives home via plane for Christmas, he doesn't expect to battle terrorism inside a big office building. Bruce Willis plays New York cop John McClane whose fearless nature is tested when an office party that his ex-wife is attending is invaded by several men with guns. Naturally it is up to McClane to solve the situation by picking off the assailants one by one. Entertaining and tense although it sways during a last moment shooting in the conclusion that comes off as corny. Director John McTiernan scored success with Predator the previous year and here he makes great use of an office building. Willis brings guts and sarcasm as McClane narrowly avoids death and seems at odds in dealing with police. Alan Rickman makes for a terrific villain whose plans are botched when McClane makes off with his detonators. Rickman brings a sly sarcasm to the role that is particularly slick during his first encounter with McClane. Reginald VelJohnson plays the one cop willing to listen to McClane but the role is more or less a prop. Bonnie Bedelia as McClane's ex is pure cardboard. Alexander Godunov plays Rickman's top henchman whose role is to be a punching bag. Explosive action that isn't very demanding but it is to die hard for action fans. Score: 7 / 10",

375,20 June 2008,Ibuk,9, The ultimate guy flick,When released Die Hard was a massive success and shot Bruce Willis to fame. I loved Die Hard as a child and it was only when I brought the DVD of Die Hard 1 and 2 I realised I still love it. Bruce Willis was outstanding as the cop in the wrong place at the wrong time and Alan Rickman was equally brilliant. Die Hard is a unrelenting ride of violence and tension which results a superb bloodbath finale. Although I do love the sequels they lacked the remarkable brilliance of the original. Out of sheer loyalty to the die hard movies I went to see Die Hard 4.0 and thought that it was pretty good. Unfortunately it regular comes under criticism from fans of the original who say that the fourth installment was nothing like the first three. Die Hard is the ultimate action flick that is great for a guys night in. As a matter of fact I refuse to speak to anyone who says they dislike Die Hard.,
376,12 January 2023,freethinkingworld,9, After Thoughts,An Action Classic for the ages!!! I Far too often forget how great the movie is! This film really did put Bruce Willis on the map as an action star. It's really interesting watching some of his earlier work before this. I think what makes this film so great is the iconic lines and some of the best action out there. Like for real! It's great! I also really really liked Riginald Vel Johnson's role as Sgt. Al Powell. I really wish his character would have ended up like a Luther Stickell type character from Mission Impossible that helped John McClain more in the sequels. And of course we can't forget the great Alan Rickman proformance in this movie. Possibly the best action villain!!!!,

383,21 July 1999,V Hanna,8, Sleigh Bells and Machine Guns Ring Are You Listening?,"I saw Die Hard three times when it came out and have watched it every Christmas since. What makes this action extravaganza a Christmas movie for me (other than the movie taking place on Christmas eve) I have no clue. It has to be the Jingle Bell sound effects, Christmas trees crashing in the lobby, or probably Bing Crosby singing 'Let It Snow' at the end. It has become my personal 'It's A Wonderful Life'. Anyway, enough with Christmas this movie is good, very good. Bruce Willis does one hell of a job as McClane. He has the physical look and street wise demeanor of a New York cop that makes his role deliver the movie just as much as Mel Gibson does for Lethal Weapon. And, one of the unconscious reasons I truly love this movie is that the terrorist aren't your run of the mill shoot'em up bad guys. They come across as smart sophisticated criminals who actually have a very good plan and aren't afraid to look you in the eye and shoot you without blinking. Alan Rickman the leader is a great villain. He comes complete with wit, snide remarks, and the always popular anti-American rhetoric. Another actor who does a great job holding up the movie is Reginald VelJohnson as Sargent Powell. His verbal battles with his boss are something that is encountered at offices across this great land everyday. Even the two FBI guys come complete with egos, good looking suits, and the names to match (great line that is usually missed by the normal viewer). As for action and sound it's an A+. That is a big reason I saw it three times. I knew it was going to be on video but I couldn't resist the explosions and glass sounds over and over. There are also sound bites and comedy that pops up and lets you release the tension. John McTiernan did great work setting up camera angles and shots that add to the excitement. Good examples is the shot in the air shaft (classic line included) and the shot from Powell's car as someone comes crashing down on it. You won't find to many better at delivering high paced action and all the trimmings that make this kind of movie a delight. A Christmas classic for years to come!!",

Bruce Willis gives a lifetime performance as John McClane and the recently deceased Alan Rickman is simply fantastic as the main villain. What's so great about this movie is not the action, but the story itself, and the fact that McClane is outnumbered and it's unknown whether he'll win or lose. McClane's witty lines and his signature ""Yippee-ki-yay"" influence me to this day. This movie has a simple story: 12 terrorists take over the Nakatomi plaza and demand many things while keeping one secret. Unfortunately for them, there's the guy they didn't count on - NYPD Detective John McClane. The fact that the main villain doesn't know McClane's face and vice versa. See, this is yet another great thing about this film - (SPOILER ALERT) they will be meeting each other, and it won't be pretty. Thank you, John McTiernan, for making this movie.

387,28 July 2006,robb_772,8, Action classic,"Hands down, one of the most influential contemporary action films of it's era, DIE HARD is a white-knuckle thrill ride that almost single-handedly redefined the genre and inspired a whole slew of imitators and sequels – none of which can even close to matching the impact of the original. The film also sent star Bruce Willis into the stratosphere of success, which had both positive and negative ramifications. One of the main reasons that Willis is so effective in this film is because he represents an action hero who is also very much an everyman, a quality that has been diminished since Willis was catapulted to Hollywood's A-list. While I find much of his subsequent performances to be cloying and self-congratulatory, there is no denying that Willis is absolutely perfect here as DIE HARD'S brittle, wisecracking protagonist.",

I finally watched Die Hard last Christmas and I have to say that I found it incredibly entertaining! 80's action films are usually corny and cheesy, Die Hard did have its one liners and many cliché moments but it had so much more than that. It has depth, it has characters that you care about, characters that you can connect to and genuinely tense moments that don't feel forced. Die Hard is set in a multi storey office tower, it's Christmas Eve and an office party is in full swing. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is visiting his wife there as the office is held hostage by terrorists looking to get rich and get out. John McClane is out of the terrorists sights as they gather the hostages and takes it upon himself to bring them down one by one, on his own.

People think that Die Hard is the best Christmas movie I kinda disagree there don't get me wrong in my opinion this is a masterpiece who I want to watch over and over again but is not that Christmacy. Alan Rickman is a great villain and that film was actually his first Hollywood movie and he was excellent - he has a unique style of acting who makes him different. The most underrated role is definitely that of the cop(Reginald VelJohnson) that talk to Bruce Willis he was the connection to the rest of the world and he plays that role perfectly and actually was a great bromance moments between the two.

413,26 June 2019,Exiled_Universe,8, A CLASSIC 80'S ACTION HOSTAGE FILM!!!!!!,"This was a great and i thought that everything about it was great. The cast with Bruce Willis was great and so was everybody else, and also the acting was great. I've seen many hostage films but this one for me stands out the most because while i was watching this, even though its old i felt like i was in the movie and the suspense scenes were very intense and also a lot of intense moments. This is just a classic enough said. Some of the one liners are kind of cringey but i mean its late 80's so you got have them. A very good story and it was very entertaining and not boring, but some times it can be a bit tedious but its a hostage movie so you have to expect that. The blood and gore was actually kind of surprising how good it was and so was all the special effects. A very decent movie that you should watch, very good and is best when watched on a nice December night!!!!",
414,15 February 2005,Ryno_II,4, A very overrated action film.,This movie is on this sites top 250 but I can't figure out why so many people like it. The problem simply is that John McClane makes one stupid decision after another.,

This is going to sound nit picky but I just have to say it. Did anyone notice that when the Germans have Maclean pinned down and Hans knows that Maclean doesn't have any shoes or socks on, He gets an Idea. Hans says to Karl, in their native tongue of German mind you, ""Shoot the Glass"". Karl gets this confused look on his face like he has no Idea what he just said. Hans gets miffed and says to Karl in English, ""Shoot the Glass"". Almost like he is saying ""Whats the matter Karl? Don't you speak German!"". I mean its was almost comical. Here these guys have made it abundantly clear that they are from Germany and that there first language is German, yet, some of them have to have things said in English in order to fully comprehend? Just a little observation. Still a great film!",
417,25 May 2005,Space_Lord,8, The action movie that broke the mould!,"Die Hard is the movie that redefined action movies! Think about it, have you seen any serious action movie (if that makes sense) since that doesn't imitate Die Hard in some way? The mould was truly broken after this one! Bruce Willis was a comedian before this movie and now when you think wise-ass ballbreaker, you think Bruce Willis. This is the movie that made Willis. His performance as John McClane is awesome! McClane is a New York cop who has flown to LA one Christmas to make a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife. When the building is taken over by terrorists, it's up to the hopelessly underprepared McClane to save the day! To counter McClane there is the calm collected villain Hans Gruber (masterfully portrayed by Alan Rickman), who refuses to take his eyes off of his objective. Everybody must watch this movie at least once! The first, the BEST!",
418,27 June 2021,juampibiermayr,10, A Movie that never gets old! Bruce Willis plays an icon I will never forget!,I still remember the day i went to watch this in theaters. It was such a good experience I watched it 3 times in the theater! And I don't do that often! From that point on it instantly became my favorite movie after buying in the video store. Bruce Willis plays the most likeable character in an action movie as he plays the hero who dosen't want to be the hero he just wants to spend christmas eve with his family but get interrupted when terrorists seize the building. It is such a good movie I never have trouble remembering any of the scenes and the dialogue. Honestly out of all people in the world I would love to meet Bruce because he plays the best character ever. I have never heard anyone disliking this movie. I wish people would pay it more attention to this movie now. Back then it was all over TV not many people watch it. Such a great experience.,

It sheer action and adventure through out the whole movie and it will definitely keep you at the edge of your seat. This is the series that will be action filled no matter how many movies there are.

420,8 September 2008,inkblot11,8," It's not hard to see why some folks, ho ho ho, claim this is their favorite Xmas film, it's pretty darn exciting","John McClane (Bruce Willis) has just landed in Los Angeles at Xmas time. A New York City cop, he is going to spend the holidays near his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and his children. Holly, a rising corporate star, was offered a high echelon job for a Japanese conglomerate and she accepted the position. This caused a deep rift between the couple, for John is a born-and-raised Big Apple resident and he doesn't want to leave the city, no matter how big his wife's salary is. Over the holidays, they are going to try to come to a resolution. Yet, when John enters the skyscraper headquarters of the Japanese company, his wife is committed to helping with the holiday party that is in full swing and he goes to a washroom to clean up. Just at that moment, a German terrorist, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his gang take over the building in a near-perfect seizure and the employees are turned into hostages. The German thug is after the million dollar bonds that are locked away in a heavily-fortressed vault. Meanwhile, McClane manages to slip away to the elevator shaft to spy on the crooks. It is John, then, who witnesses Hans executing the Japanese CEO when the businessman does not give the gang leader the combination fast enough. Hans, it seems, believes that the computer expert he brought with him will be able to crack the code. As it may take hours, however, John has some time to find a way to stop the killers. But, can one man really do the impossible? This is a very exciting film, with plenty of white-knuckle action and suspense. It launched the career of Willis into superstardom, of course, and spawned three sequels. As the never-say-die cop, Willis is terrific, cracking jokes as he tries to pick off the enemy one by one. Bedelia is nice, too, and the rest of the cast, including Alexander Godunov, is first rate. As for Rickman, he is superb as the cold-blooded terrorist with the eloquent voice and style. It really brought his career to the forefront, too, and his performance ranks high among those of the evil villains of film. The action takes place mostly inside a building, so there is no great scenery, but it manages to make every nook and cranny of the edifice into a battleground. Costumes are fine and the production values are high. Best of all, the script and direction are truly inspired, as the struggle between the good guys and the nasty ones is thorough and exciting. If you are looking for a movie to get you in the Christmas mood, this one may do for those twisted minds out there or, rather, for those who want a bit of action in their holiday films. So, show the children something like The Polar Express or Elf, then send them to bed, for Die Hard is strictly for adults only.",

428,20 February 2010,johnmschofield,10, A non stop action fest which will always deliver,"I really like this film and it is safe to say that I liked it from the first time I watched it. There is just something about it that works for me. None of the actors particularly stood out above any of the others and the storyline is automatically limited due to any action taking place at the main building but work it does and as I have said before about other films this just feels right. The director and crew did an acceptable job regarding all the special effects but this film is in a fortunate position in that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. That makes this film special and the result is a non stop action fest and in that regard it is very well made. The leading criminal is very convincing and has a motley crew assembled all of whom appear to have no scruples whatsoever when it comes to getting whatever they want. The Police and others in authority are generally portrayed as idiots which also works well. Yes its contrived and not quite believable but like I said it works and any obvious joins or inadequacies during the just over two hours length do not spoil the enjoyment. I got carried away with the excitement and just let it roll. The film is called Die Hard and most of those involved are not going to go without a vicious fight and frankly that is part of its appeal. The bad guys are not just fodder for the good guy to blow away, they have more than a modicum of intelligence and of course get increasingly frustrated that they cannot dispose of the Bruce Willis character. The finale is predictable but is entirely in keeping with the rest of the film. Anyway I would recommend this film to anybody just enjoy the ride and don't look down too often.",
429,23 October 2005,sol-,7, My brief review of the film,"A well-made action film with an excellent technical side, the somewhat convoluted plot takes a backseat to the action and thrills, yet the film still delivers its excitement well. The characters are quite run-of-the-mill, including a very typical hero, but at least Alan Rickman manages to bring a bit more to his character: something sly and mysterious. Paul Gleason's character is an annoyance and a waste, but he is fortunately not giving too much screen time. There is too much time though spent on useless supporting characters in general, and the messages about marriage and relationships are too obvious to be effective. Still, if not quite a masterpiece, this is energetic stuff, very good of its type, plus there are some moments of comic relief well worked in.",

He meets her at the office Christmas party in a high rise building. But wait, there's more! Terrorists take over the building, but the Willis character ruins their holiday cheer. The premise of 1 good guy vs several bad guys seems far-fetched on paper. But they pull it off. This movie is entertaining. John Mclain doesn't appear super human or invincible as he mows down each terrorist one by one. He shows enough fear and trepidation to make each scene believeable. The director also uses a mix of drama, comedy and suspense to keep the movie rolling. Two hours of guns blazing, bombs exploding and profanity would have been too tedious. The Christmas setting is also a nice touch. This is a guy flick, so it's not for everybody.

444,10 December 2006,wereuat06-1,10, A nobody put into the best action film of our time...,This has got to be without a doubt the greatest modern action film ever. It is the story of a New York cop John McClane having trouble with his relationship and finding him self in even deeper trouble with some terrorist who decided to take over the Nakatomi Plaza. There is Hans Gruber the leader who talks in a smart fashion but is actually not as smart as he thinks he is. And then there is Sgt. Powell the ever so cheery cop trying to help out McClane. It is an all star cast line up. Bruce Willis one of our most beloved actors could not have played this part any better. He had the New York comedy we expected him to have. No one knew who Willis was until he took this part and played it perfectly. There is a lot of action. A lot of cop talk and every scene just gets better. I recommend this to anyone who likes an action film and a good laugh with lots of intelligence. i give this movie a 10 out of 10.,

Why? Probably because when the first movie showed up in 1988, McClane stood out as a normal guy, as opposed to the various Rambos and Terminators that kept invading the screens.

Taking place at the Nakatomi building, little do John and others know that a group of terrorists, led by Hans Gruber, plan on holding the place hostage long enough for the group to break into a vault concealing over six-hundred million dollars. What hasn't already been said about this movie? It has been the staple and influence for many others in its genre and is quite possibly the greatest action film of all time. From the stunts to the sound design, choreography, tension, quips, shootouts, and so on and so forth. The two main players in the story, that being John and Hans, play off of each other well, as one tries to figure out the other in a game of cat and mouse. Alan Rickman proves to be cold and calculating as Hans and also on the same level as Bruce's character in different ways. Meanwhile, you have many supporting players and pieces that contribute to the escalation of the situation, like the hot headed LA police chief, the news reporter, the FBI, an overconfident associate of Holly's, Karl (right hand man of Hans), etc. Then you have Sargent Al Powell, who John makes a beautiful comradery with by the end of the film. As great as this movie is, there is just one little thing that holds me back from a ten. With so much going on, there are a couple of scenes we jump to that I believe bring the movie to a halt. Perhaps the editing department could've found a way to improve the pacing of those scenes to fit the overall flow of the film, but other than that, Die Hard deserves all of the praise it can get.

If anything, McClane was the child of Dirty Harry Callahan; and if Harry was the ultimate badass cop for the 70's, McClane filled that role in the 80's and early 90's. Even more so than Callahan, McClane was a hero every viewer could identify with; wise-cracking, neurotic, short-tempered. It's the character that made Bruce Willis a star overnight, and made Die Hard one of the defining films of its genre. And even if parts of it seem dated, and a lot of the supporting actors do a cheesy job, Willis and Alan Rickman are both spectacular enough to hold the whole thing together, making it a constantly thrilling and wholly enjoyable movie even twenty years later.",

You feel for the characters and want to see the character John McClane take down all of the terrorist that invade the Nakatomi Building. Other action movies usually just make throw away characters. And a plot nobody cares about. I'm trying not to give story. Because to me, you have to see it and surprise yourself. Because the funny thing Is, I first saw it on a VHS that I bought from a yard sale for 50 cents. It's one of my favorite movies of all time. Not on my top ten, but probably around my top 20.

Innovative, one might say, given the many standout elements of it worth mentioning. There's the machismo of the good guy but also his many flaws and even a scene where he breaks down in tears. Conversely, the ubiquitous John McClane is a total smartass, sarcastic, sneering, aggressive good guy and tough as nails but still very mortal. All of this is portrayed brilliantly and slyly by Bruce Willis. Just the same can be said about a versatile, cunning, and sadistic Hans Gruber, played by the late and great Alan Rickman. Even the smaller characters aren't so small throughout, in their roles and performances. But a personal favorite of mine is definitely Alexander Godunov (also late and great) as Karl, the big bad blonde terrorist. His final scene is my favorite, particularly the scream (though likely not his own) that indicates, and symbolizes, his violent ""return.""

What I find to be the most important aspect of the film, however, is the main character John McClane. As an action hero, he is surpassingly relatable. Unlike other actions heroes of the 80's, John is not invincible. He gets hurt like a normal human being, showing his human side, and having the viewer feel for the character. And of course the action is impressive and the basic storyline is still enjoyable. There are real no negatives that can really be pointed out, it isn't perfect, but it is a classic, unforgettable film. All in all, the acting is good, the dialogue is hokey but lovable, the action euphoric and the story typical but still captivating.

In this age of vampire slayers and plucky tomb raiders, the action hero has become something of a box office shadow. Let's look back in time, then, back to 1988 when a little film called Die Hard was released. Expectations were low for a film loaded with explosives and expletives. But then the cash began to flow.",

545,28 December 2021,sam-90646,10, Best action Movie,"Best action Movie of all time. Plot, cinematography, score, acting, story all extremely well executed and the action is even better than The Matrix (because it IS real).",
546,29 December 2020,pg-tsinc,8, A Christmas movie for many reasons,"Considered a 'Christmas movie' not only because the action is during Christmas, but because it's a gift to the viewers: Action stunts, cinematography and acting, especially Alan Rickman (Hans Gruber making is FILM debut in 1988).
John McClane (Willis) a NY cop visiting unexpectedly his wife (Bonnie Bedelia), will defeat a team of 11 professional robbers and save the lives of many. He's the only hope for the hostages held in the Nakatomi tower, because most of the police deputy & officers ((Paul Gleason) and FBI (Robert Davi) are mostly incompetents. Rickman is the main pivot attraction, as a villain leader with brain & class.
Gruber has a precise plan involving the theft of 640 millions of dollars in bonds. Even if the rubbers are skilled and well-armed, this will be scraped by a super cop, who will 'neutralize' most of them, one by one. The film is filled with great stunts and special effects.
Willis will manage to be in radio contact with a police officer on the ground (Reginald Veljohnson) who's the only cop able to understand and help him.
The casting is very special, for instance, Gruber's right-hand man is Alexander Godunov, a famous ballet dancer who became an actor like Baryshnikov. He was only 38 during this shooting and dies in 1995, 7 years later from hepatitis (related to his alcoholism). He was born in the Sakhalin Island, like Yul Bryner.
There's also Dennis Hayden (Eddie) a 100% look-a-like of Huey Lewis except for his size, Hayden is a former football player. The 'dubbing' of his voice, was in fact done by Lewis himself, making it a perfect illusion.
When I first saw the movie, I thought 'Let it snow' was sing by Robert Mitchum. Did you notice the similarity with Vaughn Monroe's voice?",

Bruce Willis plays the greatest role he's ever been with the iconic John McClane. John McClane is likable, relatable, and is truly one the best protagonists ever. Alan Rickman has a phenomenal performance playing Hans Gruber. Hans Gruber is one of the best antagonist in any movie ever. He's well spoken, well dressed, calm in demeanor but still incredibly threatening throughout. Alan Rickman steals every scene he's in. Pretty much every character in this movie is extremely memorable from Reginald VelJohnson's Sgt. Al Powell to De'voreaux's Argyle to Bonnie Bedelia's Holly Gennaro/McClane to all the others. The movie is also extremely well written. From the unforgettable dialogue to the clever plot set ups at the beginning of the movie, the script is really amazing.

Every single thing about this film is well thought out and executed with class and that makes for a perfect movie experience. The cast is absolutely marvelous with Bruce Willis as one of (if not the) most likable action heroes in cinema history, John McClane and the ever excellent Alan Rickman as the suave yet merciless terrorist leader Hans Gruber and basically every actor does their job magnificently. Even Argyle the limo driver (I don't remember the actor's name) who looks like an obnoxious stereotype character at first turns out likable and even memorable. Behind the camera we've got John McTiernan whom had only directed the cult classic ""Predator"" and does an absolutely flawless job in the director's chair. The action is wonderfully gritty and realistic which is helped a lot by the refreshing vulnerability of the hero. He gets the crap beat out of him and he bleeds! Not to mention that this is maybe the most well paced film I have ever seen. You get to remember every character's name while there is more than enough action and plot twists to keep your eyes fixed on the screen. I don't know about you but I am thrilled from beginning to end every time I watch it.",
552,31 October 2002,mm-39,6, The Die Hard that started them all.,"I hate this one, but the story and action saves this film.  I believe it must be Willis character.  Reminds me of a jerk in high school that is popular, but everyone only pretends to like him;  Or someone at work who has to over prove all the time, and you wish he would just walk away!  At least Willi's character can back his actions, which is better than alot of 30 an 40 year olds who run around living in denial.  I guess this over macho 80's bi-product is the shame of my generation.  It has a lot of sappy Hollywood cliches.  The over syrupie cop who can not fire his gun, and why did they have the Run DMC limo driver in this film, what did he add to this film. The boring over done gender conflict the action hero has with his wife.  I do not know if this is because of Raider of the lost Ark, but the late 80's early  90's where full of blond bad guys, how over done.  Every late 80's action film has to copy 48 hours swearing to prove how macho one is. Despite this baggage the action saves this film.  The fire fight, the chopper explosion, and rocket attack make this film exciting.  I would watch this film, but probably route for the bad guys.  6/10",

All of this unfolds in a skyscraper building which adds that much more drama. Bruce Willis handles the role of Det. John McClane just perfect he provides many funny one liners. Now if this movie is not liked by a guy then they have a testosterone problem because action is what we guys like.

People who do that just overrated cinema and praise movies that genuinely were a complete waste of their time. I think that is why I hate most action movies that have been released in the 2000s. With the exception of a handful, it's a common trend for modern action movies to be cliché paint-by-the-number dramas with a few things blowing up in the background. This modern mindset that action movies have to have cliché drama elements or they're somehow worthless is a misconception that I never understood. I'm an action fan. I came for action. I didn't come for an hour and a halfliterally, sometimesof the buff action hero giving long speeches about how much he loves his one-dimensional kid with cancer. In this sense, Die Hard makes the biggest, most recent action blockbusters look pathetic. I'm very happy to write that its main focus is action; the other lame storytelling elements are all expendable.",

Willis sort of brought back his rough and tough exterior, great body, ruggedness and sexy NewYork accent( which is what he is like in real life. I like him because he is a rebel!whoo hoo!) which reminded me of his character in the fifth element I love it too! minus the cab of course His performance is awesome in this film it's the one that made him a star! The plot is excellent! This was an original film that set the standard for other action films that Hollywood has not been able to reach again.

583,14 June 2018,metalgear-25259,8, The Reason Die Hard Is The Best Film In The Series...,"I guess we could go down the 'Bruce Willis is in his prime here' path or even Alan Rickman is the perfect bad guy. But really this film excels beyond the average action film and it's sequels due to the fact it's in a contained, restricted environment where only stealth and quick thinking can secure the advantage against the odds. This scenario ramps up tension when there's little chance of escape. Unlike the following films which diluted the tension somewhat by allowing John McClane to run around freely or going on chaotic vehicle chases.
 Bruce Willis wisecracks become the light in the darkness in Die Hard. Including his lighter that leads him down ventilation shafts. The action is purposeful and tense. Each fight there's a reward to be had for success which helps to heighten the action suspense. Ammo is limited and our hero really doesn't want to be where he is.
 All in all Die Hard becomes an action, suspense, thriller where the outcome isn't looking positive and the underdog faces some strict odds in a claustrophobic scenario. A tension filled, thinking man's action film is what results here. And something which is rarely achieved to this day.",

607,13 February 2023,paul2001sw-1,6, A film of its age and genre,"Watching seminar 1980s action movie 'Die Hard' for the first time 35 years after it was originally released, you more or less get what you'd expect. Namely, big hair, lightly racist tropes played for comedy, unexpectedly causal smoking, sympathy for a muscled-up Bruce Willis playing a man afflicted by the fact that his wife is good at her job, a vague sense of unease around Japanese corporate ascendency, and a plot line whose implicit message is that there's nothing worse than a bureaucrat. The movie even ends with a frankly disgusting twist, in which a cop who'd killed a kid regains the courage needed to fire his gun again and this is presented as a happy ending for one and all. Either you like this kind of thing, or you don't. In its favour, it has Alan Rickman as a smooth villain (arguably his most famous, although hardly his most demanding, role); and some of the action scenes (those in the lift, and when Willis jumps off the roof) are pretty cool.

609,16 April 2002,thehumanduvet,8, Original monster action spectacle,"Wow what a whopper, this beast was an instant classic of monster proportions, and it's easy to tell why - Bruce Willis on top form, getting his vest filthy for the first time and pouring out those witty asides, Rickman scorching as the teutonic baddie in his tailored suit, the constant stream of banter keeping the less active moments racing and those action set-ups to die for. But this is far more than just some jokes and some explosions, the whole setup is a masterpiece of cunning simplicity, one man against them all, trapped with nowhere to run and nothing to do but fight for his life, using the high-tech tower as the ideal arena for Willis' particular flavour of wiseguy superhero, with every move carefully prepared for and in keeping with the overall picture. The characters are believable and even charming, the dialogue constantly snappy, the music perfect, and the attention to detail fantastic - every character is allowed a bit of interest to make them all memorable (perhaps they were thinking sequel even then?), there's so much little stuff going on, so many minor details of plot that all just keep on ticking along until their turn in the sun arrives, the logic always totally on the money with none of the gaping holes in reason that typify yer average cheapo actioner.

Die Hard,which is the biggest action movie of 1988 blows you away, completely. Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a New York cop, who is in Los Angeles going to a Christmas party in a skyscraper. He is just another cop who is off duty and just attending the Christmas party to be with his wife. We learn that Willis' character is a struggling person who is trying to keep the relationship with his wife going. Then, terrorists invade the building, seizing off exits and entrances. The terrorists' leader is played by Alan Rickman, who has a great performance as the evil Hans Gruber. Everybody in the building is held hostage and that the only person who is not a hostage is John McClane. He has only one shot to fight against the terrorists and his has to use his wits and skills to fight back. Soon enough, the police and F.B.I arrive to control the building. All I can say is that Die Hard has a number of great action sequences and a lot of great performances by Willis and Rickman.

620,20 December 2014,moviemattb,10, Yippee Ki Yay to One of the Greatest Action Films Ever Made!,"""Die Hard"" is about a New York cop, John McClane who has come to Los Angeles, California to celebrate Christmas with his family on Christmas Eve. His wife Holly McClane, who formally is now Holly Gennaro is now working at the Nakatomi Plaza building as everyone is enjoying the Christmas party when a group of terrorist led by Hans Gruber is taking over the building as the people are being hostage, and as Gruber is trying to robbed the building's money. So, it us up to McClane to kick some major butt at Gruber and his men to save his wife, and the rest of the hostages. ""Die Hard"" is without a doubt one of the greatest action films ever made as well as being a Christmas classic; it really does kick a whole lot of butt as I am watching it. Bruce Willis is and shall always be remembered as John McClane; he gave such an awesome performance and there is no one to play the role because Willis is so darn perfect. Of course, he did deliver the famous ""Yippee Ki Yay"" line and it is indeed memorable because everyone always remember that line. Alan Rickman plays such a memorable villain, and he is a whole lot of fun to watch. The rest of the cast are great in their own roles. Michael Kamen does a fantastic job with the music, and it does give so much excitement as there is action going on; also, I thought the action is really darn good and it really is exciting. The movie does go by at a very good pace, and it never tries to slow things down. John McTiernan, who just got off from directing another great movie by Twentieth Century Fox ""Predator"" does deliver a great movie, and does handle it well when it all comes to action movies. There have been many movies that tried to ripoff the same formula as what this movie did will never be as good, or the same as what made ""Die Hard"" so awesome.

This is basically what made Bruce Willis and rightly so, he did do some of his best acting in it. All the bad guys were pretty good, the only character that really got on my nerves was Ellis because he was just such a sleaze. I thought it was cool that the father from ""Family Matters"" (Reginald VelJohnson I think) made an appearance as a cop because he really is such a great actor yet you don't get to see him in too many pictures.

629,4 February 2009,scott-sw,10, One of the best,"I would rank Die Hard in the top three or two best action films of all time. Most people know the plot: New York Cop John McClane wants to spend with his kids in Los Angeles. His ex-wife's boss provides a limousine to bring him to the corporate party. During the party, a group of terrorists seize the building, sealing it off from the outside. They did not count on McClane being the wild card in the deck. Die Hard works in so many ways--better than most action films. First, it sets the standard and formula. After this one, we saw many adaptations of Die Hard on a boat (Speed 2, Under Siege), a plane (Con Air, Passenger 57), a train (Under Siege 2), a bus (Speed) and probably at least a half dozen more I can't think of. Second, the story draws us in. John McClane, played wonderfully by Bruce Willis, is someone we can identify with. He is smart, tough, and flawed. He bleeds, unlike Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzeneggar. I cannot recall one movie in which the hero is totally bloodied like McClane is at the end. Third, there is a cool story with interesting characters. McClane's wife, Holly, is tough, strong, and we want them to get back together. She and Willis have good chemistry at the beginning when they talk and argue. We also have a headstrong Police Chief (Paul Gleason), the sensationalist Dick Thonrburgh, the insightful Sgt. Powell (Reginald Van Johnson), the overbearing and arrogant FBI Agents, and a very poised, confident heavy in Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). The screenplay is also well-crafted, giving us a cat and mouse game as well as a battle of wits that does not degenerate to silly one-liners prevalent in Arnold and Sly movies. As story, screenplay, and characters all interact with director John McTeirean, we get a very credible, exciting vision of excitement and tension. Finally, there is a certain degree of believability to this one. Unforutnately, the believability was strained with each subsequent sequel. This is one of the best, bar none.",

Probably the least action-packed of the titles mentioned above, but I think it's the best of them! Always a pleasure to watch (done it already like 30 times or so) because it just clicks on every level: the direction is all good, the setting is original and well used (another bow to the director), the hero is physically limited (a little love handle around the stomach, maybe?) and vulnerable (and not just physically- the moment where McClane talks to Powell about delivering a message to his wife IS touching) and the villains are terrific, by the way there are 13 of them, not 12!",

Well.....","""Die Hard"" (1988), for a long time, I've wanted to see this ""movie"". Everyone is always talking about how great it is. People keep saying over and over again: ""this is the greatest action film of all-time!"" So, I finally gave in and bought the full ""Die Hard"" film collection on DVD. What a mistake I made! Such a complete waste of money it was. This ""movie"" has a very predictable and cliched story, standard to mediocre acting and a jumbled cliched soundtrack. As far as the storyline goes, it's just as basic as it sounds. A group of terrorists hold a group of people hostage in a 40 story hotel, and it's up to an underdog cop to save the day. Seen it! Being that this is one of the most popular action films of all-time, I thought: ""okay, they are on the right track. The plot is simple, and it'll be easier to get more invested in the action and any comedic elements. As long as they keep this recycled plot line fresh, this should be a great movie! Right?"" Wrong! Now, I'm being honest with you guys, this is one of the most boring action films I have ever seen. I actually kept falling asleep! During an action movie! How is that possible? Action films are supposed to be fun and exciting to watch, not dull and boring. Another really huge drawback, is that our hero, John McClane, played by Bruce Willis, gets hit more than the villains do. Now, I understand that fights between protagonists and antagonists in movies or TV shows have to be fair and incite challenge. The bad guys should get a few hits in, but ultimately lose at the end. The victory of the hero should be earned. At the end of the day, you want to see the villains get their brutal comeuppances. But, to tell you the truth, John McClane was nothing more than a bad guys' punching bag in this ""movie""! That was really frustrating, every fight scene was a huge disappointment. All of the other action scenes are just transplanted from better movies and poorly executed in this one. Be original, for crying out loud! As far as the acting goes, it's just mediocre for the most part. The only ones who actually gave somewhat passable performances in this ""movie"" were Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman and Reginald VelJohnson. Those three made the ""film"" worth watching, because they are all good in other movies or shows they're in. They had potential, but sadly, the poorly written script marred them from giving it their all. Such a crying shame! The soundtrack is okay in some places, but it's just a jumbled mess. It doesn't stay on a consistent tone and once again sounds like a last minute addition. Why rush something like the film score? That's one of the most crucial elements of a movie or TV show. Seriously, that's really starting to infuriate me! Now for the positives, yes, there are indeed a couple of positive elements in this trash heap. The sets/locations and the special effects are perfect. All of the sets/locations are great and help give the ""movie"" a nice atmosphere. You can't go wrong with Los Angeles! Finally, the special effects are well-done and still hold up to this day. ""Die Hard"" is, without a doubt, one of the biggest letdowns out of any movie I've seen during the first viewing. Now, it's not the worst letdown, but it's definitely up there! I'm struggling to rate this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. A word of advice, don't listen to what other people say, especially ""professional"" critics. The only opinion that matters is yours. If you're looking to watch a great action film, just avoid ""Die Hard"". Otherwise, you could ""Die Bored""!",

Yes I know I didn't use that Yippie-Kay-ya line because its already been used too many times in other reviews. But anyway onto the film, We are talking about that amazing John Mctiernan movie Die Hard. Die Hard is basically about terrorists take over Yakitomi plaza and John McClain has to stop them. Now that sounds simple right? Well looks can be deceiving as there are many twists and turns and it all takes place in this plaza and in a few other places as well. Bruce Willis as John McClain is such a bad-ass in this movie and is easily one of the best action characters ever written. He's funny, vulgar, and overall a real character that you care for. But how can I forget one of the best villains ever in movie history: Hans Gruber. Alan Rickman plays this absolutely entertaining as hell villain and he is very different from other villains as he is very unpredictable and changes his plans when things go wrong and being calm and collect about it. His plans are absolutely deviously clever in this film. I wont go into much detail as it will spoil the movie. Alan Rickman is just so entertaining when hes on screen. Also, the secondary characters were great as well in their roles. Not to mention the cinematography is fantastic and John Mctiernan gets some awesome shots and crazy camera angles that make the film more tension-built and suspenseful but entertaining as well.

650,21 December 2021,Philipp_Flersheim,3, I am too old for this kind of thing,"Tower buildings have few entrances relative to the space they provide; moreover, hights are always thrilling: they allow people falling to death or being thrown off the roof, offer the chance to show a helicopter landing on top of them and so on. They are therefore well suited for action or disaster films: remember 'The Towering Inferno' of 1974. 'Die Hard' has become a classic of the genre. This is despite the ludicrous storyline that defies belief and the cardboard characters that could have been adapted from a comic book. Moreover, the picture plays to a large number of popular prejudices, most obviously to the idea that 'the state' (here represented by the police and FBI) is useless, if not dangerous, and that real problems are being solved by loners acting on their own initiative. The loner in question (Bruce Willis) goes through all kinds of implausible dangers to emerge battered but victorious; moreover, like in all films aimed at an audience of male teenagers, he gets the girl. His antagonists are of course foreigners: In this case West German terrorists turned robbers who speak with a ridiculous fake German accent. Their leader Hans Gruber (horribly overacted by Alan Rickman in one of his cheesiest roles) cannot even pronounce his own name (he says something like 'Grubber').

653,11 January 2008,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,10, A daily comment from Midget Emma: Die Hard (1988),The best action movie ever.,
654,29 December 2004,AwesomeWolf,10, Excellent,"'Die Hard' - a near perfect action movie, and one of Hollywood's most influential modern-action movies. The movie follows a simple formula, a formula which has been repeated over and over again since 'Die Hard': A cop finds himself in the middle of a terrorist plot, with many hostages involved and no escape.",
655,20 August 2003,senrav2,9, Incredible,"This is the ultimate action flick. Bruce Willis shines as the hero John McClane, and Alan Rickman is excellent as the terrorist leader Hans Gruber. Reginald VelJohnson (TV's Carl Winslow) is great as McClane's police contact on the ground. The story is compelling, and the action is incredible. There are plenty of gunshots, explosions, and an amazing hand-to-hand fight between Bruce and Alexander Godunov. John McTiernan outdid himself as an action director with this movie.",
656,28 December 2003,mlshoe,10, Still Finding Little Details,"This is my all-time favorite action thriller. I usually hate the genre, actually, because it turns into pointless killing fests without a lot of reason or rationale behind the killings. But in this film, EVERY scene of violence is well thought out and advances the plot, leading John McClain closer and closer to the villains' real plan.",
657,11 August 2004,Mahalie,10, The best action movie ever.,"Die Hard, one of my favorite movies, is like I said, the best action movie ever. It is also up there with Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, The Shawshank Redemption, and Office Space as one of my favorite movies ever.",

Not only that, but the movie has cross-over appeal. The movie makes most action lovers top films lists, and even many people who aren't big action movie fans like it.",
659,1 February 2014,mgruebel,7, Classic one-liner action,"In the mid-1980s, a transformation of the action movie began. The gritty action dramas of the 70s, of which Gene Hackman vehicles like The French Connection, or at the B-level Charles Bronson's Deathwish were emblematic, gave rise to more cartoonishly violent but breezier fare, enlivened by one-liners and more oblivious to realistic plotting. Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and yes, Bruce Willis led these films. It was the era of the Reagan quip, and while that era has long ended, lesser such films continue to be made.",
660,19 November 2002,Bry-2,8, My favorite Christmas movie,"Within the action/adventure genre, this is tops, a ten.  John McTiernan proves himself the best director in the field, cemented his reputation in Hunt for Red October, and maintained a different kind of momentum with Medicine Man.",

Also I'm not a huge fan of Bruce.W, though he a gave a worthy performances in this 'Last Man Standing' and 'Sin City'. My main beef is in some of the most stereotypical German baddies, Dumb L.A.P.D cops and the most arrogant Feds (with an attitude).

The story unfolds brilliantly and the sudden bursts of action inter-spliced between great bits of dialogue, including some classic one-liners, make for pure popcorn fare. John McTiernan shows some of his Predator magic by staging some brilliant action sequences and Alan Rickman makes a damn good baddie. This is the original hero-triumphs-over-all-odds premise that has not been bettered.

674,29 September 2021,shanie25350,1," Overrated, interminable, and has not aged well","Boring, interminable, and more talk than action. I remember enjoying this film when I first saw it as a teenager, but it has not aged well. The beginning is too slow, and it takes too long for anything exciting to get started. Whenever there is any action, there are too many interruptions that were probably meant to be funny, but are just annoying, unnecessary, and interrupt the flow of the action. The action is mostly guns, explosions, and destruction--typical of big-budget Hollywood action movies of that era. As someone who had gotten used to the faster-paced Hong Kong action films of the '90s, which had silly plots, but at least had non-stop action and incredible fight choreography and stunts that you didn't see in Hollywood movies at the time, this one was simply somniferous for me. Not even Alan Rickman could save this movie for me, but at least he made a good villain, so I give this 1 star.",

676,26 April 2001,Howlin Wolf,10, An undisputed classic. (SPOILERS),"The best of the trilogy (although ""DHWAV"" is also great), ""Die Hard"" succeeds because its characters all seem like real people; as opposed to indestructible superheros and moustache-twirling villains.  John MClane has an argument with his wife just before all hell breaks loose, but we don't lose sympathy with him even though he's a bit of a jerk, and the scene where he tells Al Powell to give a message to Holly is extraordinarily touching. Time has obviously been spent on the script so it's not just a ragtag collection of one-liners (There are a few priceless ones in there, though) This has a great effect on the viewer because it gives us an actual story rather than a string of setpieces.",

679,1 June 2022,tcamyuntoldartist,10, Home Alone's gritty prequel essentially... less John Candy,"A great action movie needs just as a good hero, as a great villain. With constant, visceral jabs at each other, so only by a hair, the hero comes out victorious eventually. What makes it more eerie is that the good side includes some shady side characters who care for only themselves. The very, menacingly cartoony FBI guys come to mind here. Later on in the series it's more of a gimmick to see John McClane all red from blood and open wounds nearing the end, but this is the only movie both in the series' perspective, and really all action movies as a whole, where the protagonist seems vulnerable, but still holds on because just so much is at stake. Great mild comedic moments to ease the mood, some deep drama interspliced here and there, and fantastic action feeling very real, something the CGI-fest of the 4th and 5th movies and alike just will not ever possess. Probably Bruce Willis' and Alan Rickman's greatest roles.",

In my opinion, this is as close to a perfect action movie you can get. Perfect characters, perfect one liners, perfect plot, perfect villain, etc. This simple yet genius movie revolutionized the idea of a lone man trapped in the wrong place at the wrong time with NYPD officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) trapped in the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles after terrorists lead by Hans Grubber (Alan Rickman) invade the building, with John only relying on all of his police training and his wits to survive this Christmas Eve from Hell.",

Reaching back to 1974's The Taking Of Pelham 1-2-3 for its basic approach, it deliberately shied away from the supremely confident heroes of the Rambo and Schwarzenegger genres and instead focused on a hero who is as scared as the hostages he is trying to rescue. It also got Bruce Willis' film career really flying after the disappointment of Hudson Hawk and the end of the TV series Moonlighting, and also introduced the general public to Alan Rickman.",

I will never understand how this is a highly-regarded film especially when the script, direction & acting is so illogical. John McClane has got to be the most stupid cop around. His actions are illogical & downright stupid. He shouts when he should be quiet. He holds when he should shoot to kill. He talks loudly when he isn;t even sure if the bad guys are searching for him. His wife, who is one of the hostage, proudly exposes his identity twice to her colleagues. The FBI are a bunch of jokers suitable to act in Home Alone movies as dumb villains.

692,4 January 2023,IrateTyrant,8," Semi-decent, not great","This movie is blown out of proportion by a lot of people. It consists of a stupid plot about a terrorist organization taking over a tower. The villains are overacting a supreme amount, and the protagonist is only dumb enough to be barely believable as a hero. It skims the surface with stunt work and can make for a charmingly thrilling action movie but lacks substance in any way to make it actually stand out. Billed sometimes as a Christmas action movie because it takes place during the holidays, it is a romp through silly dialog which is grating to watch.

I can't even explain the whole movie because of it's awesome action for the entire film. Great with the guns and it's suspense, surprises and pop ups will appear in this movie. Let's also consider the great acting of Willis and Rickman. They both have the best acting skills on the film. The others were 8.5/10 acting. They just didn't have enough screen time. How much would I consider Die Hard the greatest action movie? Without hesitation, I would give two thumbs up. Thanks for reading this review.",

In here McClane had a lot of troubles killing them. And for a 1988 Film, the quality of Production is fabulous! And the idea of having the Police not believing him, except for 1 Policeman, is a great idea!",
699,8 September 2003,MovieLuvaMatt,8, Never gets enough credit,"Though I definitely can't say the film is underappreciated, it mostly gets appreciated for its action.  ""Die Hard"" is not just effective for its incredible stunts (and boy, they are incredible!), but also because it has a great plot!  Action works best when it enhances the film, and it rarely works when it IS the film.  The characters are very well-developed.  Bruce Willis' John McLaine is not a larger-than-life action hero.  He is a burned out New York cop out of his jurisdiction, who's separated from his wife. You can actually relate to his character.  Sure, it's cool to watch him blow away the bad guys, but what would you do in his situation?  Jump in front of the gunfire?  It's not just a cinematic device.  The dialogue is slick with such memorable lines as ""Yippie-ki-yay motherf**ker"" and ""No f**king s**t lady!  Does it sound it like I'm ordering a pizza?""  The movie manages to effectively combine a great plot, great action, a great sense of humor and even a little bit of heart.  Plus, Willis himself never gets enough credit for his role as John McLaine--a role in which he owns!  I heard Richard Gere was originally approached for the part.  I like Gere and all, but there's no way he could've captured McLaine like Willis.  First of all, Willis comes from a comedy background (anyone remember ""Moonlighting""?), so it doesn't sound forced when he says those funny lines, with a perfectly straight demeanor.  And he just has an everyman look to him.  You can imagine yourself bumping into a guy like this at a local bar.  And this is the dude who ends up saving the day.  Go figure.  Reginald VelJohnson (who many remember as Carl from ""Family Matters"") is great at playing the sympathetic cop, who's the only man on McLaine's side.  This movie proves he has definite range as an actor, and it's a shame his film career consists mostly of bit parts and cameos.  Here, he's given a supporting role, playing quite a pivotal character.  Paul Gleeson plays the stereotypical loudmouth police captain, whose job is to be hated by the audience and shoot his mouth off at the cop who's simply doing his job.  In a film of lesser quality, I'd probably point that out as a major flaw, but I was able to let that slide. Plus, it added to the fun of the film.  And English character actor Alan Rickman is terrific as villain Hans Gruber, pulling off a convincing German accent that's not over-the-top and maintaining a coldly terrifying demeanor throughout.  This is a film for everybody, even if you're not the biggest action fan.  ""Die Hard"" is good, solid entertainment that never ceases to please.",

702,26 December 2018,andrewmerritt-31652,10, The best Christmas movie,"What is the greatest Christmas movie of all time? Is it Home Alone? Elf? Love Actually? No it's Die Hard. Die Hard stars Bruce Willis and the late Alan Rickman. Bruce Willis plays John McClane a New York cop who gets invited to a Christmas party at Nakatomi Plaza to visit his ex fiancé. However when he arrives terrorists take control of Nakatomi and its up to John McClane to save the day. The reason why Die Hard is a Christmas movie is because it's not afraid to be different than the other Christmas movies out there. It does follow the same rules as Christmas that we all know, but the filmmakers take the classic Christmas movies that we grew up with and flip it upside down. And now what we have here is It's a Wonderful Life meets Rambo. There's no law that says that every Christmas movie has to be light hearted. Or that it has to be a magical, family friendly experience with an ending that puts a smile on your face. And when you breakdown Die Hard that's what it is. A magical, family friendly experience with an ending that puts a smile on your face, only with guns and terrific action sequences. But what makes this movie perfect is Alan Rickman's performance as Hans Gruber an evil, but fun loving Grinch trying to steal Christmas. In all the movies where terrorists seize control of a building there's always a leader involve, but none of them will ever beat Alan Rickman. He possesses charm, charisma, and carefreeness that in the end I don't hate him, nor do I find him annoying, but interesting. He's like the type of person who you wouldn't mind having a beer with because everything he says is so brilliant. And deep down in the part of my brain I actually want him to succeed, but this is a Christmas movie and you can't let your antagonists win. I didn't think this as a Christmas film at first, but as a fantastic blockbuster and when this movie first came out it had a summer release. But the more I thought about it, that even though the movie had a summer release date and the plot of the movie is on Christmas the more I asked myself: Is Die Hard a Christmas movie. And the answer is always the same. Yes it is because it dares to be different and it's not afraid to express its true colors. I bet when they first pitched this movie of combing action and Christmas everybody laughed and said it couldn't be done. But they did that and what they gave us is the greatest Christmas action films of all time. So in conclusion put down your copies of Elf, Love Actually, and Home Alone, because you haven't really experienced Christmas until you watch Die Hard.",

This film is so good not only because of the mind blowing action scenes, not only because of the hilarious one liners, but because of the character's relationships with each other. I could not imagine a better person to play 'John McClane' than Bruce Willis. He has the tough guy feel, but as the movie progresses we see a softer side to him especially at the start with his ex. Alan Rickman is a great baddie because he does not over do it, his cold eyes and soft menacing tone are more than enough to convince you this guy is pure, ruthless evil. This film is amazing, if you have not seen it - do so.",

710,24 March 2003,fivejackace,10, The Perfect Movie,"""Die Hard"" will never be topped. I'd never seen a hero quite like Bruce Willis' John McClane, who was both reluctant and courageous. He was humanized and victimized, which left us mesmerized. From the opening scene of the jet touching down to the final cut of the limo pulling away, ""Die Hard"" is a ride I'll never forget.",
711,11 July 2004,efcforever,10, This film did everything but for anything did anything.,"In my opinion this is the greatest action film ever. Most action films follow this movie in doing amazing pyrotechnics on 34 story high rises. To be fair it wasn't the first action movie around. Before this was Lethal Weapon, Predator, Robocop, The Terminator and Alien. Yet none of these had amazing explosions like in Die Hard. Them movies just had gunfights at twenty yards and car chases. Die Hard builds up the tension amazingly well and the movie is constantly keeping you up to date with John McClane and the terrorists. The brilliant explosions like the one down the elevator shaft, like the rooftop one. The brilliant shootout between John McClane and Karl and Hans. The brilliant stunt (no computer) where John McClane jumps off the roof. Or the clever ending. This is my favorite film ever and I have got the Two Disc Special Edition DVD. I have also got Die Hard 2 and Die Hard with a Vengeance on Two Disc DVDs. They are all worth it.",
712,20 December 2009,d-apergis,8, both exciting and funny,"An action film pumped up with energy and punch, and one that manages to be both exciting and funny.

",
713,30 January 2000,action-6,10, One of the best American action-films!,"Die Hard is the first movie in the fabolous Die Hard-trilogy. Bruce Willis plays John McLane, a New York-cop who is visiting his wife at a skyscraper in Los Angeles. German terrorists take over the building, though.  And it is up to McLane to save the day. Die Hard was the first modern movie of its kind, which resulted in a million copycats. Director John McTiernan has made a real powerhouse of an actionmovie, boasting more firepower and quality-stunts than most other movies.  One of the best American action-movies ever made!  Be sure to watch this and its two sequels! 10/10",
714,20 June 2011,Frank-White359,7, great movie from 80's!,"At the end of the Eighties the action movie genre, which had flourished throughout the decade, began to stagnate. Cinema goers had seen enough explosions and gunfights cloned from the same formula made popular by Arnie and Sly. Both of these men were moving in the direction of comedy and action movies needed something new.. something fresh. In stepped John McTiernan and Bruce Willis with DIE HARD. Willis, most famous at the time for the comic T.V. Series 'Moonlighting', made a perfect ordinary-man-in-an-extraordinary-situation action hero. He was believable as John McClane and not immune to being hurt. He bleed and felt pain, a first for the genre. And yet his cool confident delivery of a great wisecracking, intelligent script made him all the cooler. But most credit should go to Director John McTiernan, king of the sophisticated action flick. He made action movies slick, smart and full of pace and wit while never letting up on the bullets, cars and bombs front. Special praise must go out to Alan Rickman too whose performance as chief baddie Hans is to this day one of cinemas finest, moving convincingly from cool, calm and collected to desperate and nervous, never once seeming anything less than utterly ruthless and calculating. Die Hard is a great movie for a number of reasons but adding three dimensions to the action genre is this films finest achievement and anyone who has not sampled its delights before now would be wise to get a copy as soon as possible. But don't see it on T.V. oh no, because it is never without significant and completely unnecessary extra editing for violence and language. Enjoy it on video or DVD if you can, see it in all its original splendor, it is arguably the greatest action film ever made. And then go see the sequels.. they rock too!",
715,25 January 2003,Bud_Sturguess,10, Finally an action flick the makers can be proud of,"In an easy candidate for the greatest action movie ever released, Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a New York City cop invited by his separated wife (Bonnie Bedelia) to her place of work in L.A., a forty-story skyscraper, for the company's Christmas party. In an ironic, almost implausible, but very entertaining twist of events, the building is seized by thieves under the guise of terrorists, led by German Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman in one of his most unforgettable roles). And of course, Willis evades the submachine-gun wielding antagonists throughout all forty floors, enduring pain, thrilling near death experiences, and shootout after shootout as he is pitted against the nastiest thieves ever to hit L.A. Aside from the obvious shoot-em-up thrillride, ""Die Hard"" boasts believable acting, and a plot that roots itself deeper and deeper into the audience's attention as the movie goes on. Willis's ability to make wisecracks amidst bullets and bombs is classic, and his tension with the L.A.P.D. and the F.B.I., locked outside and doing as little as they can to help, is dramatic and entertaining. Inevitably followed by two worthy sequels.",
716,14 June 2013,Charliefsimpson,9, The action movie,"For me Die Hard is the action movie, it's got the manly everyman determined to save his girl played by Bruce Willis' in his possibly best known role in the wrong place at the wrong time John McClane. But if it wasn't for Willis' superb performance then McClane who easily have been overshadowed by the merciless Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman who armed only with a pistol and a British accent, essential for all villains, easily matches Willis.",
717,23 December 2021,jonathan_pickett,5, Over rated American Action Fodder,I saw this many years ago and thought it was a poor film then. I thought it worth re-watching given its status as a 'great action Christmas movie'.,
718,14 October 2000,jhaggardjr,10, This one can't be topped!!!,"""Die Hard"" is the best action film I've ever seen. It's a spectacularly exciting, thrilling, and exhilarating adventure that I don't think can be topped as far as action pictures go. Bruce Willis' movie career took off with this film, which I think is his best yet. Willis is John McClane, a New York cop who comes to Los Angeles at Christmastime to be with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). Shortly after arriving in L.A. he goes to Holly's place of employment, a high rise building in the Nakatomi Plaza where a big Christmas party is taking place. Minutes after he gets there and greets his wife, a dozen terrorists (most of whom are German) take control of the building, crash the party, and hold all the party guests hostage. But our good friend Mr. McClane manages to escape from the bad guys. He proceeds to hide out on several of the floors in the building. Then he decides to take matters into his own hands, and face off against the villains all by himself. ""Die Hard"" is one thrill ride of a movie that you won't want to miss. Willis is terrific as the good guy who does his best to try and save the day. British actor Alan Rickman is equally good in a standout performance as lead terrorist Hans Gruber, who Willis plays cat-and-mouse with. These two actors make ""Die Hard"" click, and they're a pleasure to watch. There are other good performances turned in by Bedelia as the career-oriented Holly; Reginald VelJohnson as Sgt. Al Powell, the cop Willis communicates to through a walkie-talkie; and Alexander Godunov as Karl, Rickman's leading henceman. A couple of other supporting performances are ho-hum (especially the one by Paul Gleason as the incredibly stupid Chief of Police), but they're only a minor quarrel in the film. The #1 reason why ""Die Hard"" works so well are, you guessed it, the action scenes and special effects. They're some of the best that I've ever seen. Seeing this movie on the big screen when I was a teenager was awesome. I hope that this movie will someday get re-released back in theaters because ""Die Hard"" is most definitely a movie that should be seen on a big screen. If that happens, this movie's sound and sound effects would also get the digital treatment. ""Die Hard"" is a great action flick from the slightly slow-paced beginning to the smashing fast-paced finale. This movie had my heart pounding and my jaws dropping the first time I saw it, especially during the spectacular climax. What a movie!!!",

But now I look at it and just see another product on Reagan-era patriotic exploitation. Just like every ""Ahnuld"" film, ""Sly"" film, etc. The only real difference here is that some of the acting is very good, and the antagonist (can't believe his name alludes me at the moment) is brilliantly fiendish.

It had a actor who was not A-list, a villain no one had heard of, and a director who had some crazy ideas about how movies should be made. It set Hollywood on it's ear. No longer could action hero's run through their movies with bullets bouncing off them. They had to be real people with families that were there for more than just window dressing. At the end of this movie John McClane (Bruce Willis) has been shot, stabbed, beaten, battered, and bruised... and he looks it. He isn't the invincible hero, just a normal guy in a bad situation. ",
735,11 May 2011,jacco59,9, An epic action classic,"First off, you should know that I rarely give out points higher than 8 (in fact, the only movie I've given a 10 yet is Pulp Fiction), so 9 is an incredibly high rating for my standards. This is a movie that changed the action genre forever, and since it's release there have been many copies of it. But anyway, back to the movie. Willis being a fairly unknown actor before Die Hard, this is the movie that launched his career, And it's understandable why. His acting is an important part of what makes this movie so epic, because many of the scenes feature just him, operating on his own against Gruber and his crew, and throwing out some incredibly funny lines when talking to Gruber and that black cop, who is by the way another important element of the movie. He's such a typical cop, lazy, eating donuts in the car, but when things get serious, he's alert and helpful. But finally, THE thing that makes this movie so awesome is the action. Action like we'd never seen it before back in '88, raw and uncompromising, spectacular and bloody. McClane (Willis) gets hurt and shot so often you find it hard to believe he can still walk, let alone run, but that doesn't matter. If you take this movie too seriously, you won't enjoy it. So, when you go watch this epic, just sit down and enjoy the action without thinking about it, because that's how it was meant to be watched.",
736,15 June 2002,Shevva,9, This Film Rocks!,"This is, without a doubt, one of the best action films I have ever seen. It has awesome scenes and is seriously cool. Bruce Willis ( who plays John McClane) does a wonderful job, I have to admit, but my favourite character would have to be Hans Gruber ( played by Alan Rickman). He appears as a legitimate business man, but has a heart of steel and the wits to match. An oxymoron is the only thing that can be used to describe him: a charming terrorist. Rating: 10/10",

I always seem to compare John McLane to Martin Riggs (Lethal Weapon) because of how real they both seem. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes action movies with a story. Mos action movies these days are just mindless explosions with no heart or actual story. If only they still made action movies like Die Hard then maybe Hollywood could still be respectable.

The characters are one-sided, and it feels like many of them are just present for a quick gag and/or comic relief.
The effects are well done, but the audio is sometimes lacking.
For example, our main character John McClane brings clear audio, with crisp dialog. Something that our antagonist does not.

750,21 March 2023,talllwoood13,7, worthy of the praise,I'm one of those who had never seen the original Die Hard yet the amount of pop culture references to it shows how iconic it is the same way Tony Montana shouts SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND or similar. This was such a ground breaking movie at the time showing us how useful actors who aren't steroid monsters or models who had never held a gun in their life can do to truly immerse us in the roles. It's been said a million times however so I'm not mentioning anything new. After watching it though it's hard to not see this as a Christmas movie as there is a TON of references to it.,
751,2 August 2012,massivepinch,9, The greatest action movie of them all.,"When John McTiernan made Die Hard he created in my opinion the greatest action movie of them all. A film based on raw fear, which gave the audience a real taste of what terrorism actually felt like. Although i was much younger then the films certificate rating, it was one of those movies (due to the sheer quality) that my father would let me stay up and watch. I remember being thrilled from start to finish by the depth in characters, the outstanding quality of the acting (Rickman as the devious villain is particularly brilliant) and the twists which play out throughout it. This is a movie where until the last minute you are never sure if the good guy will prevail. Against all odds Willis's John McClane is brutally put through is paces by a crack squad of international thieves, who are, lets just say, less then pleased with our hero's efforts to prevent them succeeding in their mission. There is just something different about this movie which puts it above other action movies. Its the personal touches which do it for me, the belief in the characters, and that they could actually be real. You care about McClane's failing relationship with his wife, you care about the cop who can no longer use his gun. You even keep an eye on the mindsets of the villains, not just Rickman, but the two brothers, the eccentric computer cracker. And even the limo driver has a part to play. This people is a film of real genius. If you enjoy films of real character depth, and plot brilliance along with solid action, you will find no greater than this.",

754,23 September 2018,jocolina,10, An unbeatable classic of the action genre,"A classic, according to my Literature teacher in high school, is a work worthy of being imitated. That is Die Hard. I was a teenager when the film premiered. I went to the theater with a friend and very low expectations, since I am more a sci-fi guy than action one. When I left the theater, I was like ""Wow, this was a thing"" and became an instant fan of the franchise. I recommended this movie to all my friends telling them that it was different than other action movies of that time. One of these differences was how the hero suffers the continuous wounds and ends as a complete mess. In the scene when John McClane extracts a piece of glass from his foot, you can feel the pain of the protagonist. The trope of a standard guy against the odds was born with this film.
Another high point is the villain. I know more Alan Rickman for this role (Hans Gruber) than the one in Harry Potter. A charming, polite and smart antagonist is more appealing than a guy that simply hates the world. I enjoyed the humor of the movie with simple situations like the requirement of Hans of releasing a terrorist of a unknown group. His partner shrugs when listens to Hans and he told him: ""I read about them in Time"".
I am aware that the later releases of the franchise don't surpass this movie, but I enjoyed all of them. In my opinion, this a breaker of the action films genre.",

The only man free roaming the building with only his service revolver is NYPD cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) who came to LA to visit his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) for Christmas.  The LAPD, led by Deputy Chief of Police Dwayne Robinson (Paul Gleason) are disbelieving and the only one on John's side is Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson). Explosions are great, but it is slow at times.  Overall, Die Hard is a thrilling ride through 40 stories of sheer adventure.",

786,25 June 2002,MikeyMo_nl,10, An instant classic,"Die Hard is one of my favorite action movies of all time. The struggle of one man against a heavily armed group of terrorists in an enormous skyscraper is executed very well. You want to be Bruce Willis, you want to be sneaking around, hiding from and taking on terrorists. It's the ultimate hero fantasy, because the story has a sense of realism. These terrorist acts happen in real life and you could be a John McClane if it happens near you. What also works are small details like John's shirt getting slightly dirtier every scene and the running gag of him looking for shoes. It's all these things and more that keep you on the edge of you seat for 2 hours no matter how many times you have seen it. What also helps is that the 2 sequels it spawned where not lesser-copies. They are also truelly original and give the Die Hard trilogy the same status in the Action-genre what the original Star Wars Trilogy is for the Science Fiction genre. Die Hard has been copied many times (Under Siege, Sudden Death, Passenger 57 etc) but never did the copies reach the quality of Die Hard (Although Under Siege is pretty good).",

John McClane was a combination of McGyver and Rambo wrapped up in a muscular chain-smoking package. As for the plot, it was pretty good. It wasn't anything too heavy, or too simplistic. A group of bad guys infiltrate a high rise building where an exclusive party is being held, take hostage those inside, blow the brains out of the company's leader, make threats and basically buy time as the group's tech wizard breaks into the highly-secured and technologically advanced giant safe containing millions of dollars in bonds.

Die Hard did two things - it created a template for big budget action thrillers with one good man against the massed forces of evil, and it turned Bruce Willis from a moderately successful light romantic actor with a predominantly TV career into a major macho big screen star. Die Hard was pretty good. It pushed the boundaries of suspension of disbelief, but it never stepped over them.

Too much time is spent on stupid supporting characters who don't believe what's going on. It detracts from what should be a breathless pace. Keeping all the action in one locale is kind of boring. I liked the sequel better because the action shifted around a lot. Hans is a villain in the Bond tradition, but the fact that he goes through this much trouble just for some money wasn't very convincing to me, nor did it make him despisable enough.

When I'm depressed, I'll watch ALL five ""Die Hards."" They cheer me up. However, it's the first one - the only one - that I really, really love. I've always liked Bruce from his ""Moonlighting"" David Addison and most of his movies, such as ""The Sixth Sense."" I always come back to John McClane. My obsessive watching of ""Die Hard,"" causes inevitable grief to family members: ""Oh no, not again."" Or ""Quick. Don't let her see the satellite grid. 'Die Hard's' on again!!"" Or, ""Did you hide the five DVDs; she's getting ready for a McClane binge watch."" To add to the family's consternation, I countered with ""'Die Hard' Dialogue Day"" where in I only answer in comments and statements from the movie. It's pretty easy when you have the entire film memorized. Sometimes, I find it appropriate to sneak in dialogue from the other four films, but I generally keep it to DHI. I like, for example, ""Well, maybe that mime..."" from DHIII, and references to ""The Warlock."" But, my heart belongs to DHI. I have always been a fan of the adventure film (no rom-coms, chick flicks, and sappy ""Hangover-type"" stuff). Real men, like John McClane don't do demeaning activities. They just take out terrorists - twelve or so at a clip, barefoot, in an blackened undie shirt, and one gun - and only wits, humor, and cleverness. Now, I must go and program, with the help of my techie daughter, my new phone so its ring tone will be - ah, you guessed it - ""Yippee - Kay- Yay...."" and you know the rest.

One other thing a lot people reviewing this movie keep calling the bad guys terrorists. They weren't terrorists they were burglars out for money.

814,7 April 2005,sandtkay2002,8, More than just a pretty face...,"Although slightly dated perhaps, but only perhaps, this movie will satisfy most people looking for an action film with a solid, edgy, story. Willis has a good track record for picking exactly that combination, hence his success. But that is not the reason for these remarks. I direct your attention to a scene in the movie on an elevator when our hero is confronted with one of the baddest of the bad guys in the movie. It's here that you see that the man can act, that he is more than an appealing action hero, that the casting agents over the years weren't taking the easy way out, that he can contribute more to a project than just his wry smiling persona. The scene I'm referring to could have easily been an overplayed feeling of mental torture, but it was more of a controlled torture, it was barely concealed anguish in its most subtle, but absolutely clear human form. It was an anguished conversation where the anguish could not be revealed, so as to not put the character in the story at risk. But somehow it was there for the audience to see and appreciate, maybe because the viewer knows any normal person would have felt that way under the circumstances. In fact, he spent much of the film terrified WHILE ALSO being determined. Die Hard was exactly that, a prolonged variation from the scene on the elevator and a combination of emotions that when well acted, are compelling, captivating, and when played out with someone like Willis and the well crafted action material that he often does for movies, is absolutely entertaining.",

Alan Rickman probably the best bad guy ever since ''Hannibal the Caniball''. And Bruce Willis!!!!! This movie is one of the few that really knocked me off my feet. I can't describe the first Die Hard moment in my life but i will try. When it came i wasn't interested of it. But as time passed Bruce Willis came up in a lot of blockbusters and i started to like him. When i looked up his first film it was Blind Date. I had seen it bud i didn't like it very much. But his breakthrough was Die Hard. I held the video in my hand and i was thrilled of expectations. All i've heard about it. I suddently got nervous when i realised that everything but the best action movie ever would be a disappointment. And when i turned off the lights and pressed PLAY i could almost fade out. After i saw the plane-scene ( ''Fist with your toes''-classic line ) i started to realise what it was about. And when i one hour later saw Bruce Willis run around with a machine-gun i was convinced. When the credits where gone i couldn't move. What a movie! When i took control over my self i WAS John McClane with a machine gun in my hands. And it was I who kicked Karls ass, and shot Hans in the head. After that I was the one who saved MY wife and hugged Al Powell. Then I drew away in Argyles Limo. Never ever before i had been so in love with a movie. It was just spectacular. And some of the lines i saw in that movie i still use myself.

820,18 September 2006,jamesolio,2, no redeeming value,"This film has almost everything that I despise. I do like the action, explosions, and Alan Rickman since he stars as Severus Snape in the seven Harry Potter flicks. Rickman is excellent at playing the bad guy. Bruce Willis thinks he is so cool; however, but nothing but a fool. So the two stars are for Rickman and the action. The subtraction of eight stars is for the ballooning votes that this movie has been given, the violence, the nudity, the vulgarity, Bruce Willis, the mindless acting by the majority, the length of the film, and finally not giving Rickman more lines. Yes, it's a slight obsession with Rickman as it seems, but I had to think of eight reasons and ran out of ideas. So if you like or love this imbecilic claptrap, you will most likely disagree with me and jump to conclusions while forming stereotypes. I don't blame you.

But McTiernan has always been a steady hand and has brought a necessary lighter touch to the genre than others in the field; it's easy to take the very underrated ""The Last Action Hero"" over anything Tony Scott might come up with (""True Romance"" being the exception).

824,8 February 2005,SAFIE_CHAN_4,10, Bruce Willis is on the top,"Die Hard is one of the highest explosion movie ever made. Bruce Willis performance throughout the movie was outrageous. We see Bruce Willis running round the skyscraper, with a gun. But he kicks ass, the 12 terrorist who have hostage the building Willis painful pill who is demolishing there plans. Die hard is a unmissable movie you members of the IMDb, watch this movie it is excellent it'll keep you on the edge of your seats. Willis has a very narrow escape in this deadly explosion high flying movie. I am really out of words I can't really explain how damn good it is just see it for your self the summer 1988 blockbuster movie. I'm sure you will enjoy it. Also did you know Bruce Willis is making Die Hard 4 (2006) Its about him and his daughter go on holiday and they clash into some terrorists. Well I wish him a good luck. How exited are you feeling about die Hard 4 please write back",
825,27 November 1998,Ron Dog,10, Bottom Line: One of the greatest movies ever,"I don't care what anyone says, but this is one of the all time greats. If you really think about it, Bruce Willis has only played 2 decent charecters (in my opinion) One being John Mcclain, and the other being Harry Stamper. Willis plays the lovable loser who doesn't look that tough, but in the end, he just won't die! He ends up kicking supreme ass, and that's why we love him!",

827,13 June 2000,the_greenflash,10, I like this film.,"There are countless reasons that I like this film.  There is a wonderfully claustrophobic atmosphere this film has, more so than most thrillers set on aircraft or the 'So the killer must be one of us..' crop.  The stream of quotable one liners are delivered well, even believably.  The scenario is far more believable than either of the sequels, and I found myself urging on Hans and his motley crew due to their ever so cunning plan.  Maybe thats just me.",

831,26 December 2005,fresh_,9, Wicked,"Die Hard is about as perfect as a straightforward action film can get. By straightforward i mean with the guns, explosions, thieves and terrorists kind of formula, rather than films like star wars and predator which are in a whole different league! The character of John Mclain is great, an all American cowboy who is having a really bad day, the cast is good (with Allen Rickman as the main bad guy), it's got the Christmas theme gwanin, the storyline unfolds nicely, and it's the kind of film u can watch again and again and know it's gonna cheer you up. Until recently i'd only seen it when I was a kid, whereas I'd seen Die Hard 2 and Die Hard With A Vengeance numerous times, but trust this is far superior to the sequels. I'm not the kind of guy that's generally into action films, but Die Hard really is brilliant, just absolute perfection within the genre.",

833,26 August 1999,Chuck-149,10," If you haven't seen it, ""Welcome to the party pal""!!","An NYPD in L.A. separated from his wife who works there.  A mastermind criminal who wants to take the building in which she works hostage.  That's all you need to know before watching ""Die hard"".  It IS the action movie of the century.  Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman lead the cast in this non-stop action movie and they're terrific.  But that's not all.  The directing is excellent and the script, well it's pretty much perfect.  ""Die hard"" has all the elements  a movie needs to be great:  It's relaxing, it's got tons of action, plenty of laughs and one-liners, and overall, Hollywood's best action-hero ever, Bruce Willis.  That's all there is to it.  Now go see it and if that doesn't keep you awake for the whole running time, you should definitely see a doctor.  The other thing that's great about ""Die hard"" is that if someone invites you to their party and asks you to bring a movie and you don't know which one to bring, bring ""Die hard"" because everybody is going to enjoy it. Enough said.  Now go rent it.",

I love watching Bruce doing these wonderful action. When I watched this movie for the first time I was a little girl. Only knew Bruce Lee and Terminator (Not even Arnold Schwarzenegger's name.). John gave me goosebumps and a real hero feelings. I love Die Hard as much as I love watching movies. I still watch Die Hard with the same eagerness in my eyes and heart. A film of my young heart!,
835,21 September 2018,stevensonger-05079,9, An action lover's film,"The 1980s' classic, Die Hard, is an action-lover's film. It's a film full of intense stand-off scenes, explosions, and suspense like every big-budget action movie should. It follows the smartass and heroic cop, John McClane, who has no problem refusing orders, so he can do what's right and save his wife. 
The film opens on Christmas Eve, where the New York City cop, John McClane has flown to L.A. to visit his estranged wife and hopefully patch up his failing marriage at her office Christmas party in the Nakatomi tower. The plot takes a turn when a group of international terrorists, led the sinister antagonist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), take control is the tower to steal $640 million dollars' worth of bearer bonds from the company's vaults. 
Meanwhile, John McClane is taking out the terrorists one by one in an effort to save his wife and the hostages in the tower. 
Director John McTiernan uses screen time very effectively by cutting away from big moments and watching a character's reaction leaving it to the audience to wonder what is going on, a tactic popularized by Alfred Hitchcock to create suspense. As Gruber and his gang of terrorists make their way into the building, guns in hands and arrive on the party floor, we do not see the moment they take control. Instead, we see McClane, barefoot and wearing an undershirt, with his reaction to the gunfire as he runs to the stairs looking for a safe floor. We then cut back to the party where Gruber has already taken control of Nakatomi tower. 
McTiernan also uses many low-angle views of John McClane to show how he is a powerful character and close up shots so we as the audience is able to feel his emotions throughout the film. The use of wide shots in Die Hard allows us as the audience to feel like we are there with John McClane on his journey to save his wife by seeing the dark environment he is in and what his surroundings are. There are very few scenes where with a lot of light. Since the movie takes place at night, it provides a darker ambiance that isn't often associated with ""Christmas"" movies but fits well with action movies. 
The suspense in this film is also fueled by classical music in scenes where something big is about to happen. Besides using a classical score throughout the film, there is a string quartet playing when the terrorists first arrive on the floor and Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" is being played when the terrorists finally manage to open the vault. 
While the plot of this film is composed mainly of McClane neutralizing the terrorists and saving the people of the tower, there is a smaller and more important story going on: a man who just wants to be with his wife and kids on Christmas and is willing to kill to get his family back together. This subplot provides John McClane with the persuasion and drive to stop at nothing to fight off the terrorists. 
While parts of the story do not seem believable like McClane falling down an elevator shaft and grabbing onto a small ledge to save himself, the story is believable enough to keep the audience engaged and wondering what will happen next to McClane and Gruber and the rest of the people in the building. Also, with the extensive use of melodrama and action in this movie, there isn't a dull moment between the cynical Hans Gruber and the heroic John McClane who treks around Nakatomi tower barefoot, even on broken glass.",
836,2 October 2002,boondocksaint20,10," THE definitive action flick...ho, ho, ho...","Simply put, this movie rocks!  Die Hard set the bar for all action films made during the last ten years.  The 80's brought us all kinds of invincible action heroes, Rambo, Arnie and Chuck to name a few.  These guys blew everything up and killed small countries worth of stunt men to boot...thus defining 'mindless entertainment'.  Die Hard is just a different type of action film.  The filmmakers were so brilliant, they made this a movie for almost everyone, since it has elements of action, suspense, comic relief, likeable characters and a loved one in danger/romance.  Also, in my opinion, the thing that makes this movie so awesome is Bruce Willis as John McClane. John is by no means a superhero, he is an average joe cop, an ordinary man who happens to get himself into an extraordinary situation, and happens to come out on top.  The audience can really relate to him, see his pain, feel his futility and relish in his small victories (pulling the fire alarm, finding the cigarettes, writing that humorous message on the terrorist's body).  The first time I saw Die Hard, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, mainly b\c anyone could have been in that situation.  In fact, this is one of the few movies that I have seen that I did not know what was going to happen to the main character at the end (of course, the first time I saw it was back in '88 when it was made), it is that suspenseful!  John McTiernan, director of Predator, another fine action flick, makes his finest movie ever.  And Alan Rickman...never have I seen such a PERFECT villan. You despise Hans throughout the picture, yet, you can't help but love his charisma and charm.  Probably the first time ever, I agree with Roger Ebert in that Hans Gruber is the number one villan of all time in my book too.",

838,28 April 2008,curtisloew,9, The Best Action Movie in History?,"Brute force, sheer determination and a vaguely plausible plot line. This is all that is needed to enable a good film in the 'action' genre, but where and how does Die Hard assert itself as potentially the greatest action movie in history? Is it through the new found talent of Bruce Willis, whose rugged looks and obvious 'action' physique enable him to leap down elevator shafts? Or is it the introduction of a new supercharged yet surprisingly normal New York City police officer-John Mclean? Whatever it is Die Hard seems to have captured the essence of an action movie to win it a definite place as one of the best 'action' movies in history.",
839,17 April 2010,tomb_92,7," Good fun, but not as good as I expected","It took me a long time to finally see Die Hard. I enjoyed the sheer nonsensical plot line and Bruce Willis' no-nonsense approach to the villains. The one-man-against-the-rest intrigues me as well. It is stupid, but it's stupid fun. Alan Rickman does steal the show as the head villain, but Bruce Willis is still very watchable. When it came to the end though, I just wasn't fully satisfied. I just felt that it didn't live up to expectations. Maybe it was because my expectations had been amplified by years of hearing such good things about it, maybe I just over-anticipated it. I still enjoyed it, even if it wasn't all I was hoping. It's violent, sweary, edge-of-the-seat stuff. Perfect for a Saturday night in front of the TV.",
