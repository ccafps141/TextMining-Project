0,20 April 2009,ccthemovieman-1,10, Great Paintings Come To Life,"Some movies - I wish there were more of them - simply look like a series of great paintings. This film has that look. You could freeze-frame many of the scenes and swear you were looking at a Gainsborough, a Vermeer, a Hogarth or similar work of art by one the great artists of three to five centuries ago. It's just beautiful.",/
1,11 March 2002,Spleen,10, I can't believe that there are people who find this dull.,"In fact it's one of Kubrick's most gripping pictures, with a narrative drive second only to that of ""Dr. Strangelove"" (and it's unquestionably a more glorious creation than, say, anything he made in the 1950s).  English director Michael Powell (while attributing a similar failing to one of his own works) says that Kubrick fell into ""the trap of the picturesque"", but while I admire Powell as a creator, the judgment is absurd: at the VERY least, each lush image shows us people not just occupying a part of the screen but inhabiting a world, and tells us much about their relation to that world.  Many shots are indeed amazing and beguile the eye, but they don't have the effect they do simply because they would make nice postcards.",r
2,18 May 2007,Galina_movie_fan,10," "" good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now"".","The beauty, the depth, and the mystery of this film are unsurpassable - what Kubrick was doing with light is just a miracle. Special lenses were designed to shoot interiors and exteriors in natural light. In one scene Barry (Ryan O'Neil) was having a dinner with a German woman who was feeding her baby and the candle light made the whole scene look like a Caravaggio's painting. This is just one of many scenes. Each of them is perfection and harmony. Costumes and sets were crafted in the era's design. Age of Enlightenment with its gallantry, wars, and duels, had been recreated in the film with the precision of the celebrated landscape and portrait masters of the period such as Thomas Gainsborough; Sir Joshua Reynolds, founder of the Royal Academy of Arts; George Romney to name just a few. If nothing else, watching BL is pure aesthetic delight - and there is one man who responsible for it, Stanley Kubrick. If ever divine film was made, ""Barry Lyndon"" was it and Kubrick could've quoted the Bible - ""God looked at everything he had made, and he found it very good"".",e
3,3 November 2004,Captain_Couth,10, The World of Stanley Kubrick: A young rapscallion makes good in 18th century Europe.,"Barry Lyndon (1975) has to be Stanley Kubrick's most realized project that he has ever taken. A big task for the maverick director. For a film like this to be made during the free wheeling seventies had to take some big stones. One must admire Mr. Kubrick for even trying to produce and direct such a complex and expensive film that had all the ear markings of a financial and personal disaster. Not only did Kubrick manage to out do his last epic ""2001"" but he has created a movie that not only showcases the untapped acting abilities of Ryan O'Neil, but a beautifully lensed film that uses minimal lighting , gorgeous sets, perfect balance, positioning and meticulous timing. I have never seen such a magnificent film such as this one. Every shot and frame plays out like an eighteenth century oil painting.",v
4,18 December 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10," A tale of love, war and power","While this is, in my opinion, not the best of Kubrick's films, it is in no way a bad film of his... some have claimed it is overlong and dull, but I don't think so. From what I've heard, it does the novel justice, and I believe that is what Kubrick went after, more than anything else. That is admirable, for a man who throughout his career was known for making unfaithful film adaptations of famous and popular novels, much to the dismay of the authors. The film perfectly presents everything from the time period in which it takes place... something that few, if any, other films have accomplished. It deals with the life of Redmond Barry, his ups and downs. The first half has us feeling sympathy with him, and shows his rise to a high position and gain the name Barry Lyndon, and everything that entitles. The second seems to turn us a little more against him, as he goes through the expected downfall that must always follow an unexpected rise to high life. Through the film he gets desensitized and careless. We follow him through most of his life, and an uneventful one it is not. As all other Kubrick films, the visual side is probably the most prominent one of the film, as he grants us several long looks at the beautiful sets and locales, and there are more than a few of his trademark shots slowly zooming out from the focus point to display the surroundings. The plot is great, and almost constantly developing. It is narrated with a good sense of irony and clever social satire on the time period. There's plenty of humor in the film to make the three hour run-time seem less long. The pacing is good and thorough without the film being slow(though I do admit that it isn't a film for those who are not used to long, visual films). The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is excellent all the way. Not even the child-actors seemed less than perfectly convincing. The costumes and sets are great. From what I understand, there is no detail in the film that is even slightly historically inaccurate. That is quite impressive for a film that takes place about a century and a half before it was made. I have heard of great deals of work done to keep many films accurate, but I don't believe one exists that manages to do so with such perfection as this. Even the very language that they speak is accurate. The special effects in the film also deserve mention here... for a film that is almost thirty years old, it's impeccable how believable and convincing the effects are... I couldn't tell how most of them were done. Kubrick was indeed one of the most brilliant directors ever... he was not only a master at his craft, he was also one of the most innovative and inspiring film-makers to have ever lived. I recommend this great piece of cinema to anyone who has an interest in the time period the film is set and any fan of Stanley Kubrick. Don't miss this one. Not his greatest, but a truly great one nonetheless. 10/10",i

7,21 August 2021,TheAnimalMother,8, Death Or Glory - Just Another Story,"In terms of story this is on the surface at least, the simplest thing Kubrick ever made. However in terms of the technical aspect, it must have been one of his most challenging. The plot is basically about how greed, arrogance and ignorance can easily become the ruin of a man. The story itself is well told, but mostly quite simple as I said. The humor keeps us interested in the story, as does its undeniable visual beauty. It is not a stretch to say that this must be among the most beautiful looking films ever made. Every scene is filmed in all natural light, whether it be by sun or fire, and the landscapes and architecture handpicked by Kubrick himself are amazing. As in all Kubrick films, so much attention to small details equates to a great result in the end. Spielberg himself has called this film ""possibly the most beautifully shot film in history."".",/
8,14 August 2003,Angry_Arguer,10, The Camera and the Stage,"When I was in high school, it was considered ""cool"" to watch Stanley Kubrick movies as they were seen as ""more enlightened forms of entertainment"" over stuff by Steven Spielberg and John Hughes.  If you didn't memorize the opening speech to Full Metal Jacket or hadn't seen Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut then you were rejected from the clique.  This was at the time when I was first viewing Kurosawa's Rashomon and Ran and accidentally came across this gem.  Sure, the rest of the gang would be quoting along with Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange, but not one of them would dare sit down and watch this or 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Fools.",r
9,26 November 2017,jamesrupert2014,10, Magnificent costume drama from a master director,"""Barry Lyndon"", William Makepeace Thackeray's tale of the rise and fall of young Irish ne'er-do-well Redmond Barry in late 18th century Europe is brought to the scene by legendary auteur Stanley Kubrick. The cinematography is outstanding as Kubrick was experimenting with a number of high-aperture lenses originally developed for NASA to allow filming in minimal light, allowing him to shoot candle-lighted interiors in ambient light. There are also extremely long-distance wide-angle shots of the English countryside and long-distance pull-back zoom shots. There was some criticism of Ryan O'Neil's limited range as an actor when tasked to play such a complicated and central character and the long film (184 min) moves at a very languid pace (ultimately, not a lot happens), but I found the story interesting and the character development superb. Overall, ""Barry Lyndon"" is a beautifully crafted 'costume drama' and if a bit of patience is required to see the story through, it is well rewarded.",w
10,13 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, One of Kubrick's best and most misunderstood,"Not his best(2001), but Barry Lyndon is a beautiful film that is so easily dismissed. I am fond of Stanley Kubrick's movies, and I honestly think Barry Lyndon is one of his best. I am not sure about it being underrated, but it is almost certainly misunderstood. Yes it is long, and yes it is slow. The length didn't bother me, and neither did the pace actually. The slow pacing as others have said is deliberate, it is essential to the rhythm of this film. Even if you can't adjust to the film's pace, so many other things compensate, especially the authentic period look, the ravishingly beautiful photography, Kubrick's superb direction and a hypnotizing music score. The story is well constructed, as is the dialogue, while the acting is fine. Ryan O'Neal and Marissa Berenson have often been criticised, but I think their bloodlessness and vacancy are a strength rather than a weakness. That aside, Leonard Rossiter, Hardy Kruger and especially Leon Vitali give fine supporting performances, while the climatic duel scene is definitive and the narration from Michael Hordern is excellent. So all in all, actually an excellent film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",1

Beautiful is of course something totally different than saying 'this is the best movie ever made'. With beautiful I mean that the movie is superbly looking with flawless costumes and sets and impressive landscapes and camera-work. And please lets also not forget the beautiful and perfect use of classical music that was all rearranged by composer Leonard Rosenman, for which he also received an Oscar. Same goes for the flawless art-direction, cinematography and costume design. Truly all the Oscars that it at least deserved to get. ",2

I can only imagine such folks as Peter O'Toole, Richard Harris, and Albert Finney were off doing other projects that Ryan O'Neal was selected for the title role.

But this was years ago, when I perhaps didn't quite have the patience and attention to underlying emotions the film asks. Upon a few more viewings up until now, I find that this really is a remarkable, deliberately paced film about a man trying to find the cues and the ways into this upper class world. ",?
19,26 November 2019,davidmvining,10," Gorgeous and involving, Kubrick's other masterpiece","If I had to boil down the ideas of this 3-hour visually sumptuous experience to a single word it would be artifice, and it's highlighted by the very first shot of the film. Like many across the runtime, this first look at the world of Redmond Barry feels like an 18th century painting come to life. Kubrick starts with two figures filling opposite sides of the frame before he zooms the camera out to reveal a stone wall that occupies much of the lower third of the frame, a large tree that fills the left half, and a blue and cloudy sky occupying the upper third. It's so elegantly composed as to feel like it comes from another era, and it's showing the audience a duel. It's the duel between our main character's father and another man, leading very quickly to the elder Barry's death over, as the wonderfully realized and written voiceover explains, a matter concerning a horse. We learn no more about either Redmond's father or the matter that took his life, but the execution of the elder Barry's single scene is illuminating to the heart of the film as a whole.",r

Only Kubrick could give us such inventive and twisted story. The main character's role could have easily been given to George Sanders if it had been made forty years earlier. This ambivalent gentleman cynical, ambiguous in his behaviour, nasty and endearing, a gentleman whose fate can't leave you indifferent.

28,22 July 2017,avik-basu1889,9, Ambition goes up against Determinism !!!,"'Barry Lyndon' has a connection with '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Just like each character in 2001(who represent their species), Barry is shown to be someone who is willing to do anything to survive and prosper. His instincts generally revolve around his selfish desires of survival. In 2001 the desperate measures to survive at all cost end up being insignificant and inconsequential because of the implied presence of a higher power represented by the monoliths. This presence of a higher power is possibly meant to imply the concept of determinism and subversion of the idea of free will. In 'Barry Lyndon', Barry's father was killed in a duel right at the beginning of the film and Kubrick adds no feeling to that scene whatsoever. Clearly losing his father at a very young age had to have determined the life that Barry was going to lead. Having seen his life get shaped for him at a very young age without him having any influence, everything Barry does subsequently in his life in nothing but to achieve success, wealth and prosperity by asserting his own will instead of having to march to the beat of fate's tune. It is remarkable how similar Barry's sensibilities are to Charles Foster Kane's in 'Citizen Kane'. Kane was another man whose future was decided by someone else at a very young age and everything that Kane did subsequently in his life was to ensure that his life never revolved around anyone else's whims.",r
29,15 February 2003,funkyfry,10, Classic costume epic may be Kubrick's masterpeice,"Kubrick at his very best, in a ponderous film about a less than heroic main character, Lyndon, who lets no human values get in the way of his quest for power and wealth.  The film doesn't let us simply dismiss the often unpleasant (to say the least) Barry, however, forcing us to sympathize with his dreams and the sadly human means he uses to find his personal immortality through the acquisition of titled nobility for himself and his progeny.  Kubrick almost lets his glorious picture of the period overpower the characters, but it is plausible that this was his goal.  A very adult period peice that blows away all Hollywood epics before and since, and pointed the way for James Ivory's superior efforts along the same lines.",v

32,27 March 2008,onepotato2,2, Completely avoids the obligation to entertain,"A slow movie isn't necessarily a bad movie. Often when viewing a slow movie, it's still possible to detect and enjoy a director's intent. In outwardly dull movies such as Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Conversation,' Kubrick's own '2001,' and 'Being There,' the movies are actually teeming with subtext, and exciting ideas which afford a view of what the director intended to explore. I cannot find any such quality in Barry Lyndon. I am unable to even guess why Kubrick wanted to make this. It's difficult to see what excited him about the project. How does the social rebellion of 'A Clockwork Orange' and '2001' dissipate into this constipated movie by 1975? Kubrick foregoes both entertainment and camera movement to a Puritanical extent here.

33,10 January 2022,CubsandCulture,10, Stands alone as an *emotional* story amongst Kubrick's work,"Kubrick is a director I more admire than like. His films are often Chinese puzzle boxes. Beautiful, finely detailed, stately but hard to open, sterile. His films rarely, if ever, invoke specific guttural feelings. 2001: A Space Odyssey for example inspires the mood of being in awe and not the specific joys of flying. The one exception is this film-it does repeatedly invoke strong gut emotions, especially fear, dread and grief.",
34,22 September 2006,nod1111rog,10, I agree with Scorcese,"Martin Scorcese reportedly considers this to be Kubrick's best film. I must agree, and I would say it's his best by some fair margin. I've never seen a film with photography that even begins to approach that in Barry Lyndon. But everyone mentions the photography. The three things that most decisively set this film apart from all of Kubrick's others and really haven't been mentioned enough are its enormous heart, its uncompromising spirit, and the way it seems to suspend time over and over again, simultaneously standing still yet flowing along easily, almost breathlessly. If you watch it expecting A Clockwork Orange or The Shining, you'll be very disappointed and may end up calling it long and boring, but if you set aside an entire evening and surrender yourself totally to its magic, I swear you'll be looking for yourself in Stunland a few hours later.

39,28 December 2004,WriterDave,10, Beyond Superb,"Two films from this past year prompted me to revisit Kubrick's ultimate costume drama, ""Barry Lyndon,"" both of them staring the opulent Nicole Kidman--Von Trier's ""Dogville"" for its languid pacing and literary narration, and the much maligned ""Birth"" for its classical music score and long, wide camera shots. What I discovered while watching for the first time uninterrupted the digitally remastered DVD of Kubrick's period piece is that the film was paradoxically way ahead of its time while at the same time over-indulgently a time warp of a film that much like a great sci-fi flick, took the viewer completely into another world, this one just happened to be late 18th century Britian and Europe.",

Others find it a pretentious flat tire. I shake my head at the latter view. How can anyone be bored by such a daringly resolute film, unless they've become such sleepy filmgoers that no movie can make an imprint on them unless it complies to their expectations? Stanley Kubrick's three-hour adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's picaresque tale, which succeeds transcendently as a film which experimented with film stock, lenses and natural lighting, may not be a great entertainment in the traditional sense, but it's a reckless augmentation of directorial clarity: Kubrick saying he's going to make this text work as a model of the way he sees the world.

44,8 October 2001,melanier,9, Masterpiece,"Barry Lyndon is one of my favourite films of all time.   Kubrick's craftsmanship is impeccable.   The film is slow and dreamy in its pace which, along with the scenic shots, establishes a romanticised watercolour view of the period (somewhat like a Carpenter landscape).

47,31 January 2005,style-2,7, Gorgeous film,"Slow as molasses in January, and as sweet, while the camera lingers, soulfully kissing and savoring each moment. With immaculate precision of detail, Kubrick constructs his story of the hapless rogue Lyndon, portrayed by that expert at haplessness, Ryan O'Neal. Being no heavyweight in the acting department (but being cute enough to not have to be), the lengthy script about the rogue's success has been tailored in such a way that it flatters O'Neal's meager abilities. By method of Michael Hordem's sonorous narration, much of what O'Neal has to do is look handsome in his 18th century wardrobe. And that he does.

Kubrick's infamous desire for perfectionism down to the tiniest details meant shooting to mimic natural light in order to capture the pure essence of the late Baroque period. The iconic candlelight scenes had to be shot with a special lens with a tiny f-stop in order to capture as much of the light possible and cast a faded glow across the scene. But he also had to juggle this with the small depth of field that would contradict the flatness of the compositions which he had so meticulously designed. The use of the zoom out/ins over the dolly is crucial to this process; the zoom allowed Kubrick to preserve the scale in his sets (a zoom would be like blowing up a picture) where a dolly would have marred the perspective. Add to that the gorgeous mise en scène and production design, and the catatonic, still-life quality of the staging and you have the often point of praise that each frame becomes an 18th century painting in itself. So we see a tender close-up of grasped hands or a despondent mourning face, and then outwards, the bigger, colder picture. ",

62,5 December 2020,baileycrawly,10, Carefully Crafted Masterpiece,"Barry Lyndon is a special film. Stanley Kubrick has carefully and lovingly crafted a brilliant tale, utilizing the brilliant technique of featuring almost exclusively natural lighting for authenticity. Through his ingenious story-telling abilities, Kubrick has crafted a film that just passes over the 3 hour runtime, but never once drags or drones. Every second of screen time matters and is accounted for. The character-building is second to none, giving the audience a cast of characters they can easily care about and find a connection with, which makes the more emotional moments resonate so much more deeply. The costuming on this film is top notch, the cinematography is gorgeous (this may very well be the most beautiful Kubrick film to look at, and that's including his magnum opus, 2001: A Space Odyssey). It's crafted to Kubrickian proportions, with a fantastic score to compliment the visuals, some incredible action scenes and some of the tensest drama that I've seen on screen in a while.
To promote the digital version of this film, Warner Bros. proudly declares that this is ""One of the most beautiful films ever made,"" and it's easy to dismiss such claims as being (obviously) hastily written pleasantries designed to sell more copies of the film, but there's some serious merit behind the claim they make about this film. It's not common for me to invest so heavily in such a long film, but Kubrick grabbed me in and didn't let me go, and from start to finish every single note in this film hit exactly the way Kubrick intended it to. Another masterpiece from the master, and without question my favorite of the Kubrick films I've seen (which is about half).",

In ""2001"" we, the viewer, got the chance to glimpse at the future as if the film where a documentary. In ""Dr. Strangelove"" Mr. Kubrick had us laughing all the way to the end of the world. But what Mr. Kubrick was able to achieve with 1975's ""Barry Lyndon"" is every bit as breathtaking and haunting as ""2001"" or any of his other films for that matter. It's not so much that one watches ""Barry Lyndon"" as the film washes over you, truly making you feel that it is 18th Century England. ""Barry Lyndon"" is not an easy film to watch for those with short attention spans or are unfamiliar with the works Mr. Kubrick because the film is a long, labourous journey. The film, which is 185 minutes long, is about a young man named Redmond Barry (played by a rather stiff but effective Ryan O'Neal) who yearns to crawl out of his poor Irish home and seek fame and fortune aboard. A duel fought over a women with a British officer forces Barry to flee and so his adventure begins. He ends up in both the English and the Prussian armies, fights in the Seven Years War, works as a spy and then marries the lovely Lady Lyndon. But this upwordly-mobile young man is doomed from the start and slowly his plans of grandeur dissolve into an abyss of despair and shame. Mr. Kubrick went to painstaking details in order to recreate the feel of the times (he used real costumes from the period, natural candlelight and actual houses of the age) and he passes with flying colors. This film embodies all that Mr. Kubrick had to say about about human nature and man's destiny (see ""2001"", ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Full Metal Jacket""). The former Redmond Barry was doomed from the start to end up at the beginning. Rest in peace, Stanley.",

I too was completely taken in with Barry's story and the eloquent way in which Kubrick presented it and allowed it to unfold. It's remarkable how time slips by unnoticeably while watching this film despite its 3 hour length and deliberate slow pace. What also struck me about it which I've not seen others comment on is the sense of humor that this film evokes about many of Barry's fortunes and ironic twists that it takes. I feel it evident in everything from the opening and ending statements displayed on the screen to the dry droll of the narrators voice along side some pretty comical situations Barry finds himself in. The dueling scenes, the style in which battles were fought, the narrator explaining how Barry's lonely German Frau took many passing lovers into her cabin during the course of the war as he rides off into the misty morning after their romantic liaison. The base human desires, not so noble emotions and flaws that arise in the characters often bring a wry smile to the proceedings. This sense is especially strong in the first half, after the intermission when things become quite dire for Barry I felt less of this comical undercurrent or only in a much darker shade. Whether one senses an undercurrent humor to all of this or not, it is a stunning memorable film and easily one of the top 100 of all time.",

What makes the movie (and for which it earned 4 Oscars), was the vast grandeur of its aristocratic settings, the sumptuous period costumes and internal decor, the meticulous attention to the detail of the social mores of 18th century Europe, the beautiful classical music backdrop throughout the movie and the breathtaking cinematography.

Unfortunately, Redmond's father has died and his mother and he live in a large family house with cousins and such. One female cousin, Nora, is Redmond's first love, as she, somewhat older, is not yet married and a definite flirt, even with a young relative. Finally, the family makes a match for Nora with a British officer but, Redmond challenges the man to a duel, where Redmond is the quicker draw. Thinking his rival dead, Barry's mother gives him a stash of guineas and urges her son to go elsewhere until things cool off. Unknown to Redmond, however, is the fact that the officer was hit with a non-lethal bullet and survives to marry his cousin anyway. More bad luck follows, as Redmond is robbed on the road of his money and horse and has no other choice but to join the British army. At first happy with the food and benefits of the Redcoats, Redmond's first real battle changes that contentment, as the horror is revealed. Thus, Barry makes plans to assume the identity of a fallen soldier and escape. It seems to go well in the beginning, as Barry meets a beautiful young German widow (he is in Prussia at the time) and spends a few lovely days with her. All too soon, his lies are revealed and he is pressed into the more severe Prussian army, for a number of years. From there, he becomes a small-time hero, meets up with a professional gambler who, likewise, wants to escape to a new venue and, eventually, our Redmond finds himself in the same social circle as a most beautiful aristocrat, Honoria (Marisa Berenson). Honoria is a married lady, with one young heir, but her well-connected and older husband is very ill. Sensing Redmond's attentions to his wife are more than friendly, the lord's anger at the situation hastens his death. After the ""proper"" mourning of a year, Redmond marries Lady Lyndon and assumes the name of his wife, too, becoming Barry Lyndon. In almost no time, the two are at odds with one another and this upsets the family's heir (Leon Vitali) to the point where he loathes his new stepfather. Although Honoria welcomes a second son, Bryan, who is spoiled by his doting father, Barry's situation is precarious, as his mother points out, on a visit. The death of Lady Lyndon who be a disaster for Redmond and his son, as the true heir would kick them out of their glorious mansion and render them penniless. Is there another way to get a title, so that Barry can stay in the posh circles of life? With his life a series of good luck, bad luck, nothing is certain, n'est-ce pas? This is a motion picture masterpiece, based on the literary classic by William M. Thackeray. The story is sensational and Kubrick chooses a narrator to help move the tale, as it is a long one. Then, too, the cinematography and the director's avid attention to the details of the time period, including scenes shot by candlelight, make it a sumptuous view. Costumes and sets are beyond description. The actors, somewhat secondary to this, are nevertheless quite fine, with O'Neal giving an uneven but stirring turn. Berenson has less to do than look lovely but her character's nature is weak and she shows it. Vitali is sensational as the brooding heir and Patrick Magee and all of the other, lesser names give it their all. I, unfortunately, waited 35 years to watch this stunning, impeccably-crafted film.

Barry Lyndon tells the story of Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) a simple farmer who lives in a small village in Ireland, which begins to live a great passion for his sadistic and persuasive cousin Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton) who makes Barry her loving slave. But when Nora gets a marriage proposal from the English captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter), Barry challenges the captain to a duel with pistols that he end's up wining, but badly affects his family because the captain was rich and that marriage would save his family from suffered debts. Barry decides to run away to Dublin, but after being robbed on the road, he lists himself in the British Army to fight in the Seven Years' War, but ends up deserting it after the loss of a friend. Barry then ends up fleeing to Prussia and lists himself in the Prussian army and ends up saving the life of his captain becoming his personal spy. But the Prussian captain sends Barry to spy the Irish gambler Chevalier Balibari (Patrick Magee), but Barry just helps Chevalier fleeing the country and becomes his protégé and best friend. And later seduces and marries the noble Lady Honoria Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) where he finally wins the title of Lord Barry Lyndon that long after only brings him suffering and anguish.",

He uses dolly out shots quite frequently in this movie, as if slowly revealing parts of a painting. There is dolly out where a young Lord Bullingdown is gazing at a magic show - pensive and uninterested, but when the camera moves backwards and more characters are revealed we see Barry Lyndon, his wife and his mother all looking happy and laughing at the magician.",

During three long hours they limit themselves to pose while most of the narrative moves off camera, evolving through the words of the narrator. And where is the genius of it all? To see it just think about the story and reflect on how it invites to be told. It's almost a story of musketeers that 90% of directors would have accelerated, florid and embellished with sword duels romantic scenes, grand statements (love, hatred, revenge ...) and boatloads of emotion. Kubrick went for a completely different path. If you want to see the story it has to be on his terms - as a still life that hardly communicates anything that yourself have to create the thrill of fitting in the frame that you have in front of eyes.

101,16 April 2014,Sandcooler,9," Majestuous, epic, fully Kubrickian","""Barry Lyndon"" isn't as much a film as it is visual poetry. Generally I don't enjoy a ""style over substance"" approach to filmmaking, but ""Barry Lyndon"" is a movie that really shows what a genius Stanley Kubrick was. William Makepeace Thackeray's novel really isn't that fantastic, to me by far the weakest story Kubrick has ever adapted. But the imagery he gets out of it, all the shots that look like Renaissance paintings, the utter coldness (nobody has emotions until the last hour) with which he tells the story makes this a true classic. And then there's the other Kubrick trademark I adore: keeping the pace as low as possible without ever getting boring. The duels for instance take ages, but that's mainly because we're dealing with someone who knows what suspense is. Who minds that it takes the duelists roughly half an hour to cock a pistol, Kubrick knows he can take as long as he likes because you always want to know what happens next. The only thing that's kind of shame is that the studio forced him to hire Ryan O'Neal, who is wrong for the character and robs the movie of some of its incredible charm. If this had a better lead, it may have been the best film (Kubrick has) ever made.",

Still, when you look at it for over three hours, you realize it's only an ordinary lemon. Cutting through the outer beauty, you find the lemon sour, overripe and choked with unyielding seeds. A few seeds are well-cast, though. Leon Vitali (as Lord Bullingdon) is one. You will have to wait, but Mr. Vitali does appear before Godot.

104,18 January 2017,darioilg,10, The life of an Irish scoundrel,"""Barry Lyndon"" is a coming-of-age story with the Kubrick touch, so nothing you've ever seen before. It is the story of an Irish boy whose life takes him to roads he'd never think he'd get in, nor does the viewer. Instead of the classic story of growth and overcoming of one's own limits, with ""Barry Lyndon"" Kubrick gives us his customary pessimistic view over the need for control of the human beings over fate or, in other words, the unfathomable number of variables that can change one's life in an instant. Almost comically, the viewer gets used to Barry's continuous shifts from luck to bad fortune in the first half hour, so that the rest of the (long) movie can be played with both the author and the addressee conscious of the rules. The setting in the XVIII century cannot be random: Kubrick alludes to that historic age in almost everyone of his films because it's the purest moment of coexistence of reason and passion, reality and staged society, some of the director's most beloved themes.",

If you think Barry Lyndon is boring, taste and patience are not your virtues. In my opinion, this is Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, for it is his most intimate and gorgeous film. Its strengths include its narration, sets, costumes, use of baroque and classical music, but most of all, its cinematography. Using only natural light whenever possible, nearly every shot of this film looks like an 18th century European oil painting fit for a king. Any single frame could be blown up and framed and hung on a wall. Based on William Makepeace Thackeray's novel, it is a rags-to-riches story about a young Irish man who climbs his way up to aristocracy by any means, including marrying a English widow and squandering her wealth. But what goes up always comes down. Some say that the casting of Ryan O'Neal as the protagonist was a mistake, but I disagree. O'Neal possesses the persona of the impressionable and emotionally vulnerable Barry. This is a film mostly devoid of emotion, yet leaves a profound emotional impact. The final result is pure art, which easily merits from me a 10/10 rating.",

115,4 October 2015,moonspinner55,7," Opulent and engrossing...however, a deep-thinking sensibility muffles its overall impact","Stanley Kubrick received Oscar nominations as director, producer, and adaptation-screenwriter of this well-costumed 18th century drama based upon William Makepeace Thackeray's ""Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq."" (originally titled ""The Luck of Barry Lyndon"" and published under the pseudonym George Savage FitzBoodle). Yet, where Thackeray's story of an Irish upstart who deserts the British army and is eventually caught and recruited into taking up arms for the Prussians was--by all accounts--a rascally adventure, Kubrick approaches the material somberly. The too-careful filmmaker is enormously fond of pastoral landscapes and action seen from a great distance. Kubrick nearly distances himself from viewers as well, though the characters do finally emerge, and the film builds in quiet emotional power. The themes in Act I are much the livelier; encompassing much of the second act, Barry Lyndon's ill-fated marriage to a wealthy, widowed Countess slows things down. Still, the human faults of the protagonist (adequately played by Ryan O'Neal) come to the fore by the film's third hour, and Barry's showdown with his embittered, sniveling stepson is the stuff of high drama. The pacing, overall, is too funereal, and a child's death is endlessly protracted for little purpose, but the fights and brawls and duels are wonderfully staged. ""Barry Lyndon"" runs 183 minutes, however Kubrick is observant and canny enough to keep things simmering, and only occasionally does interest wane. Fine performances help, including Leonard Rossiter as the showboating Captain Quin (who is sadly revealed to have no spine), Patrick Magee as the wily Chevalier de Balibari, and Dominic Savage and Leon Vitali as the child and adult versions of Lord Bullingdon. The film won Oscars for John Alcott's exquisite cinematography and Leonard Rosenman's (somewhat monotonous) music score, as well as for Costume Design and Art Direction. *** from ****",

His last feature was a movie that was ultra violent and about a totalitarianism society. This movie is different by a wide margin. It has more of a historical value because it takes place in England during the Seven Years' War and we get a sense of English society at the time. It is also based off the works of famed nineteenth century writer William Makepeace Thackeray. This film also has a lovely atmospheric air to it. Kubrick, as usual, masterfully write this feature. You could tell that this is his pet project. However, the movie does clock in at over three hours and with the lack of action, there can be a dull moment or two to be had. After all, I feel the aristocratic world can get somewhat boring at times. That being said, we have Kubrick on the top of his game as he created a valued historical narrative that remains mostly interesting and our eyes are able to feast on perfect costuming and successful camera experimenting. Essentially, Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott shot the film without the use of electrical light, and that is why the look of the film seemed a bit odd compared to other films.",

The human soul can of  course undergo many changes, yet Barry Lyndon's change from a good-at-heart  lad in part I of the movie to a stupidly cheating husband and excessively  behaving father, either intemperate or overindulgent, in part II is a  little baffling. Kubrick deviated here from Thackeray's original novel,  where the protagonist is somewhat of a rogue throughout, and tried to  add a measure of human development to the adventure story. Yet the change  for the worse happens quite swiftly, and marriage seems to be the cause.

122,13 January 2017,sol-,9, Trying to find your place in the world,"Best thought of as a film about uncertainty in life, this engrossing Stanley Kubrick drama chronicles the ups and down of an eighteenth century man whose fortunes constantly changes. Growing up, 'Barry Lyndon' was never one of my favourite Kubrick films; after all, the uncharismatic title character never changes very much and lacks personality. The narration also tends to reveal key events too early on for them to retain an emotional punch. A recent rewatch of 'Barry Lyndon' with 'A Clockwork Orange' fresh in mind was a revelation though. While one is set in the past and the other is set in the future, the two movies actually have a lot in common as they deal with young men trying to find their place in cruel and unfair worlds. Barry's breaking down into tears when unsure whether to spy on the Chevalier is reminiscent of Alex being kicked out of his parents' home with the same uncertainty of where to go and what to do, having been displaced from a once-familiar life. Emotionless as he sometimes seems, Barry makes for a highly sympathetic character too. Early in the piece is labeled as ""but a boy and does not signify more than (a) parrot or lap dog!"", while later he is referred to as a ""common opportunist"" and the film is mostly about Barry trying to change what others think about him for the better. Whatever the case, the film is very well tied together by the employment of non-original music, adapted from the likes of Schubert, Bach and Mozart. Almost every scene is set to music of some sort, and the final duel near the end is given nail-biting tension by the sombre music throbbing in the background.",
123,14 January 2007,Dr_Coulardeau,9, Cold ambition against cold selfishness,"An old film that has aged tremendously. The rhythm is slow, too slow, and it lacks any kind of feeling or sympathy or compassion. It is cold, very cold. This is the portrait of a social climber who is blocked and rejected when he has finally reached the top. Then it becomes the story of his downfall. He has a lot of luck in his life, but he essentially is a coward who uses the army to get out and away, a deserter who shifts from one side to the other, a spy who double-cross everyone, a gambler who cheats all the time, and a gross ruthless and uncouth person who uses every means at his disposal to get to his ends, even women of course. But the film shows how he is then defeated more by misfortune than by any real plan. He is defeated by the young lord whose mother he has conquered, and the details show that this young lord is even worse than the one he gets rid of, his stepfather, a vomiting retching little coward who takes advantage of the very only moment of generosity his stepfather actually demonstrates in his whole life, and this only one time towards him. He surely recovers his estate and gets rid of his stepfather but he recovers no honour, and yet Kubrick does not go that far. He stops short of saying that, though he shows it with the very last images of a sad, selfish, embittered young man who has suddenly gotten older than his age. What could have attracted Kubrick in such a story ? I can only see one answer : the deep cruelty of human beings and the unfathomable inhumanity of human society, aristocratic or not. That may explain the whole career of Stanley Kubrick : human society is nothing but a computer gone berserk.",

We follow the life of country boy Redmond Barry and his rise and fall in British aristocracy. This is done in such a fragmentaric way it's hard to name it one movie. At one part, Lyndon is a spy for the Prussian Minister of Police, but only for the mere reason to make him meet the Chevalier, and the movie has loads of such bits and parts which are small movies at itself, and hardly interesting or important enough to be concluded in the whole. Another thing I found irritating is the over-use of the voice-over. He just tells way too much. Now, 'film-technical' there's nothing wrong with Barry Lyndon, it's even a masterpiece in some ways (hence the 4 oscars, and the endless and deserved praise it gets for the fantastic usage of lenses to get that candlelight feeling on the big screen), but in the end the story is not interesting enough to catch your interest, at least not for 3 whole hours.

126,19 May 1999,Spraggs,3, William Makepeace Thackeray turns in his grave!,"Kubrick so utterly fails to capture the spirit of Thackeray's picaresque novel with this vague and tiresome film that it has absolutely no business using the title Barry Lyndon. Thackeray's Barry Lyndon is a brash, swaggering, status-seeking rogue with a dynamic (but seriously faulted) personality, and an indomitable will who  actively schemes, fights, and bullies his way through life. A true existentialist anti-hero.  Kubrick's Barry Lyndon , played by Ryan O'Neal, couldn't be more different, even though he  participates in some of the same activities as the character in the novel does. Kubrick's Lyndon has the demeanor of gentle choirboy: intensely quiet and soft-spoken with a penchant for long, earnest gazes (as is everyone in the film.)  His personality is so completely vague and undefined that next to Thackeray's brilliantly extroverted protagonist, he is practically walking corpse. Thackeray's Lyndon is a man who compels our admiration (even affection) as well our contempt such is the force of his personality. Kubrick turns him into practically a non-entity who even at the end of this three hour film remains a paradoxical and annoying enigma. We learn nothing about what makes him tick because there is nothing there. I really found myself wondering if Kubrick actually read the novel - perhaps he got a synopsis from  a script writer. Did they have Cliff Notes when this movie was made?! The film is steeped in an introspective, meditative atmosphere exemplified by the R. O'Neal character which is totally unsuited to the vigorous, ironic, and humorous tone of the novel. Kubrick has taken the fictional memoirs of a daring, villainous  schemer and gambler and sucked all the energy and life out of them to make a tepid, pensive, piece of aesthetic boredom. The only scene that has any dramatic tension is the duel between Bullingdon and Lyndon which, ironically, is not in the novel. When adapting literature for the cinema doesn't a director have an obligation to the work's author to remain faithful to that author's artistic vision? It's understandable that some concessions must be made when moving between two such different mediums as literature and cinema; but to have such blatant disregard for the essence of the novel from which this film takes its title, Kubrick is guilty of artistic hijacking. It galls me to think that there are probably more persons living now who have seen Kubrick's  bogus version of B.Lyndon than have read the novel; Kubrick, unfortunately, has had the last word because of film's cultural dominance. If a director wants to benefit from the cachet of using the title of a classic novel by an eminent author than he is obliged to remain faithful to that author's vision and not to utterly disregard it as Kubrick has done to such a wretched effect here.",

The story may be a moralistic one - a young Irish makes his way through cheats and lies to the higher positions in the British society, but is unable to live the live of his rank and survive at the pick, falling back mainly due to his own flaws of character. Kubrick films the story in a completely unemotional manner, no social or moral judgment is made, we are just brought a full world, or better say we enter a full world and we have to judge by ourselves.",

Basically in the 18th Century, in a small Irish village, Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is the young farm boy who lost his father who was killed in a duel concerning a horse sale, and he is in love with his cousin Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). He gets into a duel himself against Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) who wants to marry her, and of course Barry refuses to back off, but he apparently kills his opponent, forcing him to flee to Dublin. On the way he is robbed by famous highwayman Captain Feeny (Ryan's Daughter's Arthur O'Sullivan), and with no money he joins the British army, there he finds out from friend Captain Grogan (Godfrey Quigley) that Quin is alive, and the whole thing was staged to get rid of him and marry Nora and restore her family's fortune. Barry is sent to fight in the Seven Years' War, where Grogan dies from a wound against the French, so he steals a higher rank's uniform and passes through Holland, encountering Prussian Captain Potzdorf (Hardy Krüger) who knows he is in disguise, and threatens to kill him unless he joins the Prussian army. The war ends and he next joins the Prussian Police and a servant for professional gambler Chevalier De Balibari (Patrick Magee), and after discovering he is not a spy and Irish they become professional cheaters of cards until being expelled. Barry next seduces the beautiful and wealthy Lady Honoria, Countess of Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) and after the death of her elderly husband Sir Charles Lyndon (Frank Middlemass) he is able to marry her, and changing his name to Barry Lyndon. Ten year old Bullingdon (Dominic Savage), son of Sir Charles, hates Barry for marrying his mother, and their marriage is unhappy, but they do have a son together, Bryan Patrick (David Morley), and Barry enjoys spending all the money, and being unfaithful, which he apologises for. Years later Barry's Mother (Marie Kean) comes to live with them, and she warns him that if the Countess was to die the fortune would pass onto now young man Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali). To help stop this happening he gets himself a better title with the help of Lord Gustavus Adolphus Wendover (André Morell), spending money getting himself to the top, but his efforts are wasted, and Lord Bullington announces his hatred for his stepfather at Lady Lyndon's birthday party. Barry's public cruelty loses him some reputation and powerful friends, he is somewhat shunned from society, but he makes up for it being a good father to Bryan who he cannot refuse any gift, he even buys him a new horse for his ninth birthday. Bryan ignores the wish to not take the horse out and is thrown off and dies a few days later, and filled with grief Barry becomes an alcoholic, while his wife turns to religion, with the assistance of family tutor Reverend Samuel Runt (Murray Melvin). After Lady Lyndon is heard to have attempted suicide due to continuing grief, Lord Bullington returns from places unknown and wants revenge in a duel against his stepfather, and after starting slow he does manage to shoot Barry in his leg, meaning his leg below the knee is amputated. Bullington takes over while his stepfather recovers, and he sends accountant Graham (Philip Stone) to make him an offer and force him out of England forever and end the marriage to his mother, or he will never again get any of the family money and go to jail. With no choice and exhausted Barry agrees, sees his mother, tries to gamble for more money without success, and Barry given the cheque from Lady Lyndon who he never sees again and Bullington looking on as he leaves for good. Narrated by Michael Hordern, also starring Steven Berkoff as Lord Ludd, Diana Körner as Lischen, Billy Boyle as Seamus Feeny and Worzel Gummidge's Anthony Sharp as Lord Hallam. As the title character O'Neal gives a marvellous performance as the man passing through the years in the British aristocracy and faced with many different confrontations and situations, and many other cast members give great performances as well, director Kubrick of course creates perfect pacing, a very intriguing story with many elements and memorable moments, and you can forgive it for being nearly three hours, a most watchable period drama. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Music for Leonard Rosenman, and it was nominated for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted From Other Material for Kubrick, it won the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

I didn't think I would like this as much as I did, I thought it would be another 8/10 average Kubrick movie that didn't quite live up to my expectations like Paths of Glory and Dr. Strangelove. But this really was great. The first hour or so was kind of slow for me and I wasn't really into it as much. But soon after that I was completely hooked (and I'm surprised about it as well). Something like this shouldn't have had my undivided attention, but it managed it. I was fully invested, and almost felt like I had traveled back to the late 1700s. The production design was fantastic and captured the vibe perfectly; it's almost as if the movie was truly 250 years old. But damn. The cinematography. Every shot was truly like a painting. Some of the best in any movie I think, probably top 20-30 ever. Bulls*** Oscar snub. One of the most visually stunning movies out there, especially for 1975. This is Kubrick's 4th best movie imo, but the 3 above it are virtually untouchable (ACO, 2001, and Shining). Honestly tho, the story in this film had me completely hooked, and the ending was as intense as ever. One of my only complaints however was that the pacing wasn't too good. Every time it'd felt like an hour I would check how far I was into the movie only to realize that 25 minutes had passed. There were moments that it was a little boring, but sometimes you need that in a movie. I would give this a very respectable score of 8.7/10, and I recommend this to everyone that likes Kubrick (who doesn't really).",

It follows the life of a young Irishman, which fate has fighting in the armies of several countries before he's able to marry a rich widow. Through this character's example the film seems to be showing just how random life is, with precarious turns of events leading to entirely new chapters, as well as how foolish people are, fighting duels or marching to their deaths in senseless wars. Lyndon robs others and is robbed, he loses and wins fortunes, and he acts as a scoundrel and as someone with grace. Unfortunately the lead role is played by Ryan O'Neal, who is a weak link in an otherwise superb cast; his uneven (often non-existent) accent is awful, and he fails to give the character a sense of swagger. His character is not very sympathetic either, but a scene where fate is especially cruel is still devastating. And in the end, we see that regardless of our scurrying about, ultimately we pass away and become equals in death:",

He certainly had prodigious technical gifts, ""Barry Lyndon"" may not be be the best looking film ever but it certainly comes close, stunning at times in it's use of natural light. He acted like an artist, slow-working and perfectionist. He was certainly uncompromising. In short Kubrick looked and acted like a genius, luckily for him in the world of cinema this was enough to get him proclaimed a genius. All of his films were met by gushing reviews - witness the response to the execrable ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Yet any true critical response to his films should attempt to explain the utter emptiness of his post ""Dr Strangelove"" work. ""Barry Lyndon"" is important here because for all its beauty this is as vapid as film gets. Kubrick drains all life out of characters, the wit and irony of Thackeray totally lost. Ryan O'Neal shows that TV support roles are his natural home (Paper Moon is the only film he didn't ruin), and the rest of the cast are forgettable. Kubrick is art-cinema for those who are scared of real art - it challenges one after all, he is great cinema for those who believe that great cinema consists of nice looking pictures. He is intellectual cinema for the simple minded. There is more life and art in 10 minutes of a Jason Statham film than in this bore.

So the story isn't groundbreaking, so what. Its a great story, set in a great period and it is lovingly told by Kubrick. What was and is groundbreaking about Barry Lyndon was the cinematography. The whole movie was shot in natural light-a monumental achievement when you think about it. All of the nighttime scenes were shot by candlelight and it puts you right there in the 1760's.

Still, as visually gorgeaus as this movie is, it is never really engaging. A lot of it, I think, comes from Ryan O'Neil's stiffer-than-a-corpse portrayal of Barry Lyndon.

180,24 December 2009,Ziya90,10, With my kindest regards,"Barry Lyndon is one of the greatest films of all time to me and sometimes it makes me think that is it the greatest movie ever made? When the film ended, I was so upset, I never had felt like that in another movie as I remember. It is not surprising that for some people, it is extremely dull and too long. Yes, it is not for the people who prefer fast paced movies or movies with fast editing. This is the fact that unconventional films are not appreciated mostly. As known, Kubrick was a perfectionist director, so he made perfect films, but Barry Lyndon is the best Kubrick movie to me. Honestly, I seriously got bored while watching The Killer's Kiss that is only 67 minutes! but did not get bored while watching Barry Lyndon even one second. When I saw the lettering ''Intermission'', I felt like no need for a break. The film is probably the most still, flowing, beautiful, artistic, reposeful and kindest film ever made and it is pure cinema. The way of story telling is very elegant, kind in every scene. The background music and narration make the movie much more mesmerizing. The coherence among the music, the narration and the content is great. And I want to say that the most magical narration is here The duel scene between Barry Lyndon and his stepson. Probably the longest duel in the history of cinema. This scene is my favorite scene of the movie, I would put it in the cinema anthology. I have never seen such a duel in my life. The foxy music warns us, something sad will happen. Tension gets higher, higher and higher. It is a mix of perfectionism, quintessential cinema and art. Barry Lyndon is not a good person as he is not evil. He entices Lady London, it is a liaison. Besides, later he makes something deadly. Although, he is guilty, he gets angry when Lady London's husband lectures him and so on. I try to mean that Barry Lyndon is a deep character study. As for its rating (once upon a time, one day it was in the list, the other day it was not.) it is a huge question mark.",
181,10 April 2021,adamjohns-42575,1, An Epic Undertaking!,"To say that it's a bit of a long one is an understatement. Be prepared to sit for a long time or to watch it in two sittings. I actually think a lot of it could have been shortened, especially the duelling towards the end. My only theory is that Kubrick was trying to set a new record for the longest film ever, especially as you get closer to the finish and it seems like there has been less and less editing.",
182,5 January 2004,JasonT413,10, Poetry/Art in Motion,This just might be my favorite film by Mr. Kubrick. While not his most 'universal' it is his most delicately beatiful film. I can see when watching this film how influential it is towards films such as 'Amadeus' and numerous French costume dramas I have seen throughout the years. Abundant scenes of beauty take you to the period the film depicts. Bravo Mr. Kubrick!!!,

184,1 March 2004,jasonsurety,10, Beautiful,Barry Lyndon is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen.  It is well known that this picture was shot with natural light.  This works so well I found myself pausing the movie to admire many scenes.  The landscapes galvanize the eyes.  Victorian England has never looked so good.,
185,30 April 2015,asda-man,8, Like watching a very old oil painting dry... But somehow it remains engrossing!,"There is nothing about Barry Lyndon which is appealing to me. Everything is against it, and if it didn't have Stanley's name attached to it then I probably would never give it the time of day. It's basically a three hour period drama which moves at a snail's pace and is full of dull, stiff and unlikable characters. So, why did I like it? Why did I not find it tedious and boring? These are questions I'm still asking myself and it appears to be the hypnotic nature of Stanley's films. 2001: A Space Odyssey is painfully slow and has no memorable characters (except HAL) yet it's one of the best films I've ever seen.",
186,4 January 2022,bltclowater,10, Best movie I've ever seen,"To me, this is a movie about a man paying for the first half of his life with the second. In a sense, I think it's a story about karma. Good ol' Barry straight up is not a very good guy for the first half; he often acts selfishly, he lies to get what he wants, and while he isn't cruel or evil by any means, he's certainly more of a taker than a giver in the grand scheme of things. One day, he gives his wife a great big apology, and he's a self changed man after that moment. He's snuck and stolen his way to a position of power in the world, and when he cleans up his act, the world doesn't forgive him so easily, and that's the tragedy of it. Middle aged family man Barry doesn't deserve what happens to him, but young Barry did, and someone's gotta pay, whether he likes it or not. The final, and in my opinion most important instance of this is during his duel with his rotten step son at the end of the movie. Barry wasn't born a socialite, and in his little community at home in Ireland, a man had to be a little rougher, and fight for what he wanted, which he does in the contrasting duel at the start. His toughness has done him few favors trying to integrate into high class society, but in his duel with this punk kid, he decides he's had enough. He could win this fight, but it's time for him to be the bigger man, and he fires into the ground, to offer peace. It's too late for Barry, sadly. At this point in his life, he doesn't have a chance to hold onto his ill gotten gains, no matter how pure of heart he may be now. His step son shoots him in the leg, which is then amputated, and Barry returns to his life of cheating at gambling, only without the success of his youth. He's lost all he'd gained, because it was never truly meant to be his, and whether or not we can call this justice, or fairness, it's the harsh truth that in the end it all returns to nothing.",
187,14 July 2005,MichaelMargetis,8," ""I'm not sorry. And I'll not apologize. And I'd as soon go to Dublin as to hell. "" - Redmond Barry","'Barry Lyndon' is one of Stanley Kubrick's non-talked about films. That's not a big surprise in the slightest because 'Barry Lyndon' doesn't really break ground or re-invent the wheel really like Kubrick's other efforts like 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Dr. Strangelove' or '2001: A Space Odyssey'. That isn't to say it's a bad movie, it's actually a great film! 'Barry Lyndon' might just be one of the best period pieces of all time, and since the legendary genius Stanley Kubrick was behind it, does it really surprise you? It's lavish and extravagant beauty will impress you even if the story gets a tiny bit dull at points. Kubrick achieves making another great movie with his beautiful and uncompromising portrait of the British Seven Years War era, 'Barry Lyndon', based on William Makepeace Thackeray's beloved novel.",

189,18 August 2017,arturmachado-29588,8, The rise and fall of Redmond Barry,"In the XVIII century Ireland, Redmond Barry is a young man in love with his cousin, who is promised to an English Captain. Barry challenges him to a pistol duel and wins, being forced to flee to Dublin. On the road, he is robbed and, without further alternative, enlists in the English army to fight in the Seven Years War. When his protector in the army dies, he decides to desert, only to be discovered and forced to join the ranks of the Prussian army, where he saves the life of his captain thus gaining his trust and being assigned to spy on an Irish player. Immediately the two compatriots create a bond of friendship and become associates in the art of the game, embezzling many nobles throughout several courts of Europe. Eventually Barry meets and marries the beautiful and wealthy Lady Lyndon, finally achieving his desired entrance into high society. With his new wealth and name, they move to England where he begins to squander the acquired fortune and thus creating an enemy for life in his stepson. When his son with Lady Lyndon dies at an early age, Barry is devastated, and his stepson sees the perfect opportunity to execute his revenge... through a pistol duel. Barry loses and is forced to renounce his title of Lord, and so the movie ends with the following legend: ""It was in the reign of Jorge III that the aforesaid personages lived and quarrelled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor they are all equal now"".",

191,26 July 2016,writers_reign,5, What Goes Up ...,"Like the man said there's nothing new under the sun and this is one of the oldest stories in the book, in fact there's a nice touch of irony in the casting of Leonard Rossiter in the early Irish scenes, Rossiter, of course, was the eponymous Perrin in The Rise And Fall Of Reginald Perrin and this is basically the same banal plot with a couple of million thrown at it. We also saw it done much better in black and white yet back in 1947 or so in Nightmare Alley where Tyrone Power rose from a carnival huckster to a well-paid society entertainer and ended up as a geek in a similar carnival. Okay, this time around we get some lavish backgrounds modelled on the Old Masters but at the end of it all it's just the mixture as before.",

I think that exceptions to this rule are becoming more common these days (Master and Commander was very impressive) but only when helmed by especially conscientious and meticulous directors. And no director was ever more conscientious and meticulous than Stanley Kubrick,
