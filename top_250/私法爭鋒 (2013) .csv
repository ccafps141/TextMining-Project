0,7 September 2021,planktonrules,10, Excellent but not for all audiences,"A few words of warning about ""Prisoners"" before you try watching it. It's a very intense, violent and disturbing movie to say the least. While it is ranked #190 on IMBD's Top 250, it's NOT a film for everyone. . I mention this just to warn you...to think about this before you watch.",/
1,2 June 2014,kosmasp,10, More than just one meaning,"If you think of someone being a prisoner, you automatically might think of someone behind bars. But apart from a physical prison, a prisoner can also be trapped mentally, either by his own doing or by someone else. This movie that starts off pretty light gets very heavy. And it is carried by its actors. Gyllenhalls characters might seem odd and out of place at the beginning, even like a cardboard cutout. But he does have more to do as the movie progresses.",r
2,24 April 2017,Hitchcoc,9, Hard to Watch but Really Well Done,"Two very good actors ply their trade very well. Jake Gyllanhaal plays a policeman who is utterly driven in his quest to find two kidnapped little girls. Hugh Jackman plays a survivalist who ""prays for the best but expects the worst."" During Thanksgiving dinner, two little girls go up to a rusty old RV and shortly thereafter, disappear. The prime suspect is a mentally handicapped young man, the driver of the RV. But the girls are nowhere to be found. He is held for 48 hours and then released. It is then that Jackman takes matters into his own hands. He kidnaps the young man and, convinced he knows everything, tortures him and beats him for days. Meanwhile, another suspect arises but Jackman can't handle this and keeps pounding away. There are numerous twists and turns that seem to work well. Gyllanhaal is a troubled guy himself who has some anger issues that he keeps under wraps. I had not heard of this film and it was a treat to view it.",e

6,27 March 2020,Diablo1616,8, One of the most chilling thriller movies I have ever seen.,"""Prisoners"" is rich in compelling narratives and stellar performances from the ensemble cast. This movie had me love and hate Hugh Jackman's character which was so complex to the point of making me question my moral standards because I found myself empathizing with his character. On the other hand, Jake Gyllenhaal did a marvelous job on playing the frustrated cop: complete with all the intensity of his eyes and his intuition. While Gyllenhaal had more screentime as the lead, Jackman's performance really stood out for me.",w

9,26 September 2013,FilmMuscle,7, A True (and terrific) Exploration of Moral Ambiguity,"Wow, what an intensely suspenseful film Prisoners was. The film commences with a naturalistic and peaceful look of a suburban neighborhood, leafless trees calmly swaying along with the cool air that encompass them. All is fine, and a perfectly normal family visits their friends/neighbors for a delightful dinner and some music. Everything is fine and dandy until both family's two kids run off to retrieve a toy they left outside. After pleasant conversation, the two families begin to realize that their kids haven't gotten back yet. The noiseless environment around them feels incredibly unusual, and once they realize that their kids have officially gone missing, chaos breaks loose. We are suddenly presented with a ruthless father (played by Hugh Jackman) who loves his daughter so much that he's willing to transcend any morally difficult obstacles to hopefully locate her. ",w

This is the most serious I've ever seen Hugh Jackman and he does it so incredibly well that I hade goosebumps more often than not. From the plot to the execution thereof was brilliantly done to bring us an unforgettable, thrilling masterpiece. Be warned, though, as the film is quite disturbing at times.",7
13,20 September 2013,corrosion-2,9, Spellbinding,"Prisoners is extremely suspenseful and equally disturbing. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, whose last film was the equally spellbinding and disturbing Incendies, builds up the tension from the first frame and does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie. Aaron Guzikowski's script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller, bucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, poses serious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate cast doing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Prisoners is not for the faint heated but is likely to feature strongly at next year's Oscars.",4

I watched it when I was 13 with a friend of mine after his step-dad recommended it. It freaked the hell out of me and left me with nightmares for weeks, simply due to the performances of Paul Dano, as the quiet and shy man-child and David Dastmalchian, as the creepy and slightly eerie red herring.",3
17,25 October 2013,Horst_In_Translation,8, A definite contender for best thriller of 2013,"Even if he already worked for over 20 years before that, director Denis Villeneuve rose to fame considerably after giving audiences his 2010 film ""Incendies"", a nominee for the Best Foreign Language Oscar. With ""prisoners"" he directed his very first English-language movie. Two young girls disappear and the film centers on the father (Jackman) of one of them and the cop (Gyllenhaal) investigating what might have happened to them. Jackman, who already gave one of my favorite performances last year with his impressive turn as Jean Valjean, delivers again as a father who does what needs to be done to save his daughter's life and Gyllenhaal, who I've never been that big of a fan, impressed me as well. His portrayal of a loner, in his profession as well as his private life, gave me the chills occasionally and proves that he can pull off characters that go far beyond the pretty boy / nice guy image.",/

19,6 September 2013,will-vanduzer,9, Hugh Jackman's finest role?,"Hugh Jackman takes you on a trip through the intense emotions a family is put through during its darkest hour. This may be his best role to date. From the trailers you know that his character will be out for blood as their daughter was kidnapped, but throughout the film you feel his pain, anger and moral struggles as he deals with this situation. The director does an excellent job of keeping you invested in the film emotionally even through some intensely violent scenes. Its dreary setting provides no comfort, but goes hand and hand with the narrative. This film may not be for those faint of heart but should be a must see for most viewers.",r

25,7 February 2016,joachimokeefe,1, Here's a spoiler to save you the trouble. It's RUBBISH.,"Two young girls are kidnapped. They are rescued at the end, but the blonde one loses the ability to act. They were kidnapped by the surviving widow of a couple who went round kidnapping kids in order to make people lose their faith in God, after their own son died of cancer. The nephew they adopted, who is unable to string a sentence together much, is suspected, abducted and tortured to death by Hugh Jackman, the blonde girl's father. At the end Hugh is drugged and bleeding in a deep hole, blowing a whistle which Jake G. may or may not hear.",t
26,29 October 2013,jboothmillard,8, Prisoners,"I wasn't sure about this film when I heard of it, despite the two great leading actors, but I was made keener as I read about the plot, and in the news it was reported as being number one at the box office, with positive reviews, so I was definitely up for trying it. Basically deeply religious Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), who runs a struggling carpentry business, and his wife Grace (Coyote Ugly's Maria Bello) and their children attend Thanksgiving dinner with their neighbours the Birches, husband Franklin (Terrence Howard) and wife Nancy (Viola Davis) and their children. After this dinner both families' young daughters, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons), go missing, the police are called to search, an RV was reported parked in the neighbourhood, and it is found, the driver Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is interrogated by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), but there is no clear evidence he did anything, and he has the intelligence of a ten year old. Keller is angry that Alex was released, as he sure he knows the whereabouts of the girls, he abducts him and imprisons him in a partially dilapidated house he owns, and with the reluctant help of Franklin he brutally beats and interrogates him repeatedly without getting anywhere. Feeling really guilty Franklin tells his wife Nancy what is going on, she comes to the house to see Alex and how severely battered he is, the Birches decide not to interfere or help and to allow Keller to continue torturing him, having suffered for a few days he does speak out, mentioning a maze, with this information Keller visits Alex's aunt Holly Jones (The Fighter's Melissa Leo) to see her reaction at mentioning mazes. Bob Taylor (David Dastmalchian) is named a suspect, and at his home the walls are covered with intricate maze drawings, and in a back room locked crates filled with maze books, snakes and blood covered clothing are covered, he is taken into custody, but he manages to commit suicide grabbing a gun, he was not involved with the crime, the blood on the clothes is pig's blood, and the clothing was stolen after the abduction. Joy Birch is found drugged and taken to hospital days later, Anna is still missing, rambling the found girl says in her prison she heard Keller's voice, Loki follows Keller, finding the abandoned house and Alex imprisoned, Keller meanwhile goes back to Holly's house realising Joy heard his voice there, she holds him at gunpoint and drugs him, revealing she was the one who abducted the girls. Holly explains that she had abducted many others before, including Bob Taylor, ""waging a war on God"" making parents lose their religion as revenge for the death of her child from cancer, the first child abducted was Alex, she then shoots Keller in the leg and puts him in a pit outside hidden under a car, this was where the girls was imprisoned. Loki turns up at the house to tell Holly that Alex has been found, and he catches her about to kill Anna, trying to make her raise her hands she shoots him, he shoots and kills Holly, Anna is rushed to hospital, her mother thanks the detective, the little girl mentions her red whistle that she lost whilst abducted, and back at the Jones house Loki hears the faint sound of a whistle as the film ends. Also starring Dylan Minnette as Ralph Dover, Zoe Borde as Eliza Birch, Wayne Duvall as Captain Richard O'Malley, Len Cariou as Father Patrick Dunn and Brad James as Officer Carter. Jackman gives a great provocative performance as the father will do anything to get his daughter back, Gyllenhaal is also exceptional as the police officer trying to help him unaware of the disturbing events unfolding, supporting stars Howard and Davis are good support as well. The story works as both a kidnap mystery and a desperate search for the evidence and truth behind the crime, you may need a strong stomach to watch all the violence and torture that unfolds, it also makes you question how far you would go in a situation as portrayed in this, a controversial but satisfyingly engaging crime drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Very good!",_

28,4 August 2022,loganschainker,10, The Best Thriller of The Last Decade,"This was the film that solidified Denis Villeneuve as a modern master of cinema. I will never forget when I first watched Prisoners. I was unequivocally enthralled and invested by the direction, cinematography (from the GOAT Roger Deakins), acting and layered writing. Hugh Jackman delivers not only his best performance, but one of the best of all time. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers one of his best as well. Paul Dano, Viola Davis, Maria Bello, David Datsmalchian, the list goes on. This film was cruelly disrespected by The Oscars in every aspect. The film is titled Prisoners not just because of the abduction of two children, but because many of the characters are trapped within the confines of their individual psychology's. Therefore, they are prisoners to their own internal maze's. If your trying to get into cinema, add Prisoners to the the top of your watchlist.",r
29,19 October 2013,A_Different_Drummer,3, plot holes that could swallow Nevada,"Some ground rules. Legend has it that the first-time scriptwriter for this oddity was paid a million dollars, and then the project was shelved because they could not figure out what to do with it. Then they had a brainstorm. Just make it. And here we are with an almost-Hitchcockian pseudo-thriller that occasional resembles a police story and even sometimes a horror film. The story gives new life to the cliché, ""plot holes you could drive a truck through."" Hugh Jackman gives the performance of his life, but his character is so lacking in empathy that this might not be enough. Jake Gyllenhaal plays himself which ironically is more than enough to carry the role. Maria Bello is lost. Dennis Villeneuve is a great director who can make even the rain interesting and one would like to see him try his hand at something better written. Like the phone book.",v
30,3 December 2013,Meven_Stoffat,5," A very good first half before the film sadly degenerates into a messy and over-complicated, convoluted second half","Prisoners is the latest in a long line of critically revered movies- the type of film that gets revered to death by critics and makes it into a number of ""best of the year"" lists that has me wondering if I somehow got conned into seeing a fraudulent copy of the movie, or if the critics have either temporarily or permanently lost their minds. No doubt a lot of films have left me with that feeling this year (Gravity being another example), but Prisoners may be the worst example. And there's also no doubt in my mind that this film is widely loved by those film school students who only seem to love ""film"" and not mainstream movies, probably out of sheer fear that they'll probably enjoy one. And what makes it so bizarre that I'm saying this is that Prisoners isn't a bad movie at all. Sure, bizarre, pretentious and way in over its head at times? Maybe. But for the first half at least, the audience can assure themselves that they're about to watch a quality suspense-drama about what a parent does when their kid inexplicably goes missing.",

The movie is full packed with stupid gaping holes in the plot, which cannot be digested. The character of the detective is shallow despite the acceptable performance of Gyllenhaal. There are many attempts to make the movie deeper than it is, but in my opinion failed big time. Also,the film had way too many wasted moments. Most of it did nothing to move the story along.Overall, it's disappointing, and I felt I was the prisoner for two and a half hour.",
35,29 September 2013,zardoz-13,10, Terrific Thriller with Some Taboo Subject Matter,"Watching the disturbing Hugh Jackman child abduction thriller ""Prisoners"" is like rubbernecking at the scene of a car accident. Initially, your curiosity gets the best of you and gawk. Of course, the sight of the blood and gore sickens you. Nevertheless, you can't take your eyes off it because it makes you consider your own mortality. ""Prisoners"" keeps the blood and gore to a minimum, but the nature of the crimes leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Oscar-nominated French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve and ""Contraband"" scenarist Aaron Guzikowski have created a compelling criminal melodrama that shuns the usual Hollywood glitz and glamor. Indeed, the filmmakers accentuate realism at every turn. The squeamish might reconsider seeing this tragic tale. The unwholesome subject of child abduction qualifies as heavyweight material, and ""Prisoners"" never resorts to humor to lighten the atmosphere. Actually, the dreadful events in this narrative may challenge your ability to enjoy this intense psychological character study. Clocking in at 153 minutes, ""Prisoners"" is relentless both in its length and depth. I can't say enough good things about this inspired but unsavory crime drama. The characters stand out boldly from the background. Each emerges with greater depth and irony than Hollywood allows, and Villeneuve generates considerable, white-knuckled suspense. Sometimes, the quietest moments prove to be the most suspenseful. Comparably, ""Prisoners"" resembles an episode of the CBS-TV crime series ""Criminal Minds,"" but clean-scrubbed, well-dressed, FBI agents aren't investigating the crime. The local authorities handle the case and display appalling incompetence. A father turns into a vigilante and passes the point of no return to save his daughter. Nobody in this grim, lurid yarn is without a flaw. You won't want to be like them because they lose their cool. ""Prisoners"" is about a lot of good people doing all the wrong things. ",
36,29 September 2013,imbluzclooby,1, Utterly repugnant propaganda filled vehicle.,"Let's make a crime caper where we have an excuse to show a mentally disabled man get tortured beyond reason. Even if he might be the suspect we are subjected to the overzealous rage filled attacks carried out by the kidnapped child's father. Let's also throw in some religious rhetoric to situate villainy in Christians , elderly widows, depraved sickos and handicapped people.",
37,25 September 2013,tavm,8, Prisoners is compelling enough when being ambiguous about the way things eventually turn out,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who watched this yesterday though he didn't mind seeing it again. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are quite compelling as a frustrated parent of a missing child and a police detective who tries to do everything right in finding this child, respectively. They both go after different suspects and it's quite interesting what the results are. Plenty of points-of-views of methods and which suspect is guilty abound and it got me hooked for most of the narrative. One might be disappointed at the way things end but since the dialogue offers clues as to what could happen, one should still be partially informed enough as to the eventual conclusion. In summary, Prisoners could be good enough for anyone not minding everything not spelled out in a neat tidy package.",
38,18 November 2022,jackreinbott,9, Fantastic... but not for everyone,I was genuinely shaken by this movie. I'm usually a firm believer that the best way to watch a movie is to sit down and finish it in one hit. But an hour into this movie I was forced to get up and do something else for a bit to let things settle.,
39,18 November 2013,JohnRayPeterson,8," It'll keep you in your seat, till the end; great performances","The subject matter is one that some might consider overdone, since there have been several movies with the theme of child abduction in recent years, but you don't want to miss this one, because it is so well done and the performances are flawless. The directing and script were a very pleasant surprise to me. Unfamiliar with director Denis Villneuve, whose rating for his previous feature film, Incendies, was outstanding, I now know I'll have to see that one as well as the one that followed, Enemy, also starring Jake Gyllenhaal.",

Mostly every performance in the film was great but I loved especially Hugh Jackman, Gyllenhaal, Melissa Leo and Paul Dano. Jackman as the father of the missing girl is really believable and he delivers a performance that is truly Oscar worthy. My favorite scene with Jackman is when he meets Gyllenhaal for the first time in his house, you can really tell he is committed to the character but pretty much every scene he's in is great. Gyllenhaal as the detective investigating the case is great and he just continues to prove to me why he's one of my favorite actors. He's so versatile and can play a very wide range of roles. Melissa Leo plays the aunt of Paul Dano who plays a very troubled young man who is treated as a suspect in the film. Both of them are great and Paul Dano delivers a pretty odd and kind of disturbing performance.",

I'm surprised Roger Deakin didn't win for the amazing cinematography at least he did years later for Blade Runner 2049 from the same director too which is cool!

44,9 October 2013,ironhorse_iv,8," Like, a prisoner, I was caged in. I couldn't stop watching this film. It was just that darn good.","Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is facing every parent's worst nightmare. His six-year-old daughter and her friend is kidnapped. Minutes turn into hours, hours turn to days. Keller turn to Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) for help. Their only clue, is that RV has been parked on their street, earlier that day by suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano). While, Detective Loki is looking for evidence that links Alex Jones to the crime, Keller takes the matter in his own hands; how far will this desperate father go to find his missing daughter? Prisoners is one of the best movies of 2013 in my opinion. It's sure to get a few Oscar nominations. I have to say Hugh Jackson deserve to win, if he does. There is a very powerful scene with him talking to Loki in a car, stating out, how his daughter is looking for him to save her, not Loki. You can't help feeling for this character as he goes through an emotional hell storm. He was a man who can only trust himself. He was a survivalist, and somewhat a paranoid. He prides himself on his strength and independence as a man who can make decisions and get things done alone. That is why he did what he did and he went through a great deal of punishment for it. Keller though loses his way, and ends up in a literal pit in the ground, a ""hell"" as it were. Great use of symbolism. I love the fact that his wife's name is Grace. (Maria Bello). Grace gets more and more lost, as Keller lose more and more of his morals. Basically he has lost the ""grace"" of God through his actions. There are many scenes initially shot through dirty glass that was pretty interesting. Nobody in this film was the clear cut good guy and villain. Remind me of the verse 'Through a glass, darkly' in the Bible. Then, there is the many crosses, including one hanging from the rear-view mirror in Keller's truck. The symbolism doesn't get in the way of the plot, too much until the snakes came into play. I guess, it was a play on the serpent in the Garden of Eden, but it also could had meant the Norse symbol for the god Loki which is two entertained snakes, eating each others' tails which Jake Gyllenhaal is name after. Still, it could had been left out. Then the movie became a symbolism smorgasbord with the endless mazes, one eye themes, opening Pandora's boxes, tattoos, free-mason rings, and that got the plot more confusing. Research all the examples, I have stated out. You find yourself, surprising in depth this movie goes. Trust me, the plot will get confusing. I had to watch it, multiply times to get all the twist and turns. It was a maze of suspects. The allegory of the prison is a significant theme throughout the film. Each character, whether psychologically or physically, is the subject of some kind of confinement. Without giving it away, the ending of the film is a brilliant bittersweet ending, that can be seem as both a happy and tragic at the same time. A lot of parents will be hugging their children tonight after watching this film. A few people might not like this movie due to its controversial subject matter. I think some Christian conservative might find the movie as liberal anti-Christian propaganda that makes Christians look bad. I didn't see it that way. I think a certain Alex Jones in the world, might, but I see Keller going through the same emotions if he wasn't a Christian. The characters put into huge stressful tragic events that makes them challenge their own faith. I think the use of faith was highly welcome into this film. It made the film interesting with its symbolism. The second thing, people didn't like is the animal abuse. First off, no animals were harm during the filming of this film. Second off, the killing of the deer makes more morality sense than it's made out to be. Deer can actually overpopulate an area and starve the local species if not controlled. Some states have actual contracts with hunters to maintain a quota by cutting the herd. Then there is the dog scene. Let's remember, Alex Jones is not a smart guy, so it would make sense that he wouldn't know how to handle a dog. I hate to see PETA boycott the film over those, without understanding the facts and story. The movie isn't about the animals, but looking for kidnap children. People coming in, should focus more that, then what happen to the animals. The question comes down to morals and ethics. The acting is amazing. It's seems to me that Jake Gallenhaal's Loki is such an interesting character that fans of the film is asking for a spin-off movie. By the way, Loki blink so much, is probably because he is a detective, and they rarely sleep. At less, that what I got from his character development. It's a very long movie directed by Denise Villeneuve, but not boring. It was a very tense film with little slow areas. Overall, it's can be a bit depressing, but the thrill factor made this movie bearable to watch and it deserve the critical acclaim that it got.",

He is detained and soon released for lack of evidence, but the hothead father of one of the girls (Hugh Jackman, in a spectacular performance) decides to pursue the man and eventually kidnaps and tortures him in order to get information.

61,29 September 2013,saytosandeep,8, MY REVIEW: Puzzling Desperation,"Prisoners. It's a slick dark crime investigation thriller raising few questions on moral ambiguity. The theme is based on kidnapping of two small children in a small town where police fails to make much progress and a parent takes matters into his own hands. Like Ben Affleck's smashing debut Gone Baby Gone, the movie's journey is about putting the pieces of clues together and in parallel questioning how much evil you can become to counter the evil? Lead actors Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhall give their best and supporting actors provide nice support. Movie takes the conventional route of a crime drama but it's the unsettling intensity in atmosphere through grey background and chilling performances that keep you puzzled in a good way from start to finish. Like other classic crime thrillers, it asks you to provide your full attention and makes you discuss it more and more long after the movie has ended.",

72,20 May 2016,deloudelouvain,10, Without a doubt best movie from 2013,To me Prisoners was the best movie I saw in 2013. And to give you an example I watch about two movies per day. I just watched it a second time and even though I remembered everything from the first time I saw it I still love it. The first time I saw it was of course the best because during the entire movie you are kept in suspense and you try to figure out who is the bad guy and what really happened. It has been a long time that a movie didn't get my full attention from he first second til the last second. To me Prisoners is underrated and has his spot among classics like Seven and Silence Of The Lambs. The acting is outstanding in Prisoners. You can feel the desperation dripping of Hugh Jackman. The detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal is also a delight to watch. In fact the whole cast did an outstanding job. I don't know many of my friends that heard or saw Prisnores while everybody knows the other classics I mentioned so I could only vividly recommend you watch Prisoners. During the entire movie there is a dark gloomy ambiance that works really well. If you like mysteries and suspense you will love this one.,
73,4 November 2013,videorama-759-859391,9," Possibly the best film of the year, that takes many prisoners","Prisoners is a film that will haunt me for a while. The story is so well constructed in not your A-Z form. There's a very realistic approach to it's unhurried plot, and how it quickly unfolds in the helplessness of the two dads, friends whose little girls have been snatched, supposedly by a faceless guy, couple, loitering around the area in an suspicious RV, in the cold frosty air. This is one of many films built around the child napping scenario, the disturbing type ones, that have run more common thing in the last couple of years (Taken, The Flock) this one never more effective, though these aren't teenagers, they're kids. Prisoners works, not just because of the A level performances, some so bloody convincing, but the realistic standpoint of the characters in how they deal with the situations. We so much feel helplessness with the driven father Jackson, who resorts to kidnapping and torturing a mum, childlike suspect, you want him so much to talk, where at one point, you realize it's gonna be like getting blood out of a stone, the girl's fates, waning, or may'be already determined. Jackson does get bloody here, mind you, while his mate, not an advocate, is reversely the opposite. ""Christ, your little girl's been snatched man"", but the reverse contrast in these two characters works. At one point, as Jackman's ""Where's my daughter"", reaches a shouting pinnacle, this just reminds us of what a great dramatic actor he is. But Gylenhall, is just fantastic, as the driven cop, carving another notch under his acting belt. He brings some truly unnerving moments to his character, that you don't when he'll pop his top next. There are some sick themes to the film too, (the snakes in those containers) in a film that touches on a disturbing subject. Playing out to nearly two and a half hours, Prisoners is a rewarding experience to the movie goer, though on the other hand, you may have to allow the effect and memory of this movie to dissipate days after the view. Just cautioning some here.",

First and foremost the cinematography by Roger Deakins is flawless. It perfectly sets the tone for the film. Particularly the shots which utilise the weather to create stunning effects with lighting and shadows. This is a a long film. The runtime is around 2hrs and 30mins. Although the pacing is perfect. As soon as the film begins, each scene builds and builds with more intensity. Prisoners kept me 100% hooked with intense suspense throughout the entire investigation. Furthermore, the performances are all incredible. Hugh Jackman's character contains such powerful emotion, and he delivers it perfectly. Paul Dano also does such a great job with a highly difficult performance. Each actor disappeared in their roles. Particularly Jake Gyllenhaal. The way in which he progressed and grew emotionally, made him so compelling. The score by Johann Johannsson creates feelings of melancholy, sorrow and intensity, during times of horror. Denis' direction accompanied by the incredible screenplay has created such a captivating movie experience. I highly recommend seeing this film.

Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard play two fathers who get together with their wives but their youngest girls go missing. A suspect is brought in but he has the mentality of a ten year old. When the suspect is released Jackman abducts him and locks him in an abandon building where he brutally tortures him for the whereabouts of the girls. Director Denis Villeneuve previously made the underrated Maelstrom and here treads delicately with the idea of a possible innocent person being tortured as guilty. There is several effective plot turns that provides tension as well as aim the viewer's expectations in other directions. Jackman delivers one of his greatest performances as a father struggling with his faith as well as his role of father. Howard plays the best friend who struggles to fathom his friend's illegal choice of justice. Jake Gyllenhaal is great as a cop dealing with possible failure and dealing with the emotional elements of the job. Paul Dano steals scenes as the target suspect unresponsive to the brutality. Maria Bello plays Jackman's wife whose hopes are drifting into despair and his absence doesn't help. Strong theme of family, fatherhood and trying maintain your faith in the face of God.

In addition, it composes a somewhat slow rhythm but full of intense emotions that makes you empathize and understand the characters present. In this movie you can also appreciate the performances of the actors so involved in the character they play, since the emotions they convey with their actions are very realistic and dramatic at the same time, which makes you feel the anguish or sadness they feel. As the film progresses, it leaves you clues about the culprit of the main event, and although the outcome of the plot surprises you, the point of the film is not exactly that, what the film seeks is precision in the writing of the complete story, which makes the whole film a great cinematic demonstration of pure suspense.

100,25 November 2013,coiffuremixte,10, truly a great thriller; gut-wrenching movie,"Prisoners is a thriller which achieves a rare level of intensity and resonance thanks to the director's ability to invest the story with authenticity, emotion and originality. Compared with, say, 'The Silence of the Lambs' this slow-paced (a compliment, as the usual hyperactive pacing of Hollywood is almost a sickness) bleak mainstream film is hands down a better movie, making Demme's seem trivial, in hindsight. What I loved about Prisoners is the way that it was all about the story and the characters; the visual style was invisible and never imposed itself on the viewer. It was wonderfully directed in a manner that recalled classics by Nicolas Ray(They Live By Night), William Wyler(Desperate Hours), Billy Wilder(Double Indemnity) or John Ford (The Searchers). You could just walk into this terrifying film and feel the emotions portrayed flawlessly by the cast. The best example being perhaps Maria Bello who is my choice for best supporting actress this year with special mention going to Gyllenhaal whose idiosyncratic performance is at the heart of this film; his effortless charisma and skill place him among the very best, he is also a natural audience favorite capable of earning a very high level of empathy for his work.",

Compared to Christian Bale's Batman and Toby Maguire's Spider-Man Jackman's Wolverine is one dimensional, child friendly and as far removed from what Wolverine should be as is possible. It is also unfortunate that Wolverine is his defining role. Why? It is unfortunate because Hugh Jackman is a world class and quite simply phenomenal talent. Granted the physique gained from his preparation for Wolverine aids in his portrayal of a dominant, controlling figure. But nothing should be taken away from him here, he is ferocious in the pursuit of his daughter's captor and I for one believed he would do anything (or more apt anything to anyone) to get his daughter back. His testosterone filled male, physical dominance is akin to Marlon Brando's Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire. In short Jackman is simply stunning to watch.

The soundtrack is excellent, the camerawork is excellent, the actually is some of the best I've ever seen. But where it differs from any other movie is the plot. So amazingly thought out, everything fits into place from the beginning to the end. It starts of calm and peaceful and soon after descends into complete chaos. I found myself in tears half the time and the other half I was on the edge of my seat. The movie clearly shows how far people will go to protect their loved ones and what they will do to achieve this. If you wait till the end the payoff is huge, it is so incredibly put together, like a puzzle, and in the end has such a strong impact. I can't even put it into words how great it is...the turns, the villains, the heroes which aren't able to be indicated anymore due to the events that take place. I cannot recommend enough that you watch this if you haven't just be sure to grab a box of tissues.",

What if instead of a too long film, it had been made into a slightly longer miniseries, say six hours broken into episodes each with their own arc. I think it might have been more successful. This dragged in parts because the mini arcs within the larger story narrative were too compressed. So, could have been better.

114,27 June 2018,El-Ak,8, That's how a movie is done.,"Denis Villeneuve is no doubt one of the very few directors that has a vision and a complete look at the story before he directs it. He brought the picture so intelligently with a lot of references and small details. Like any other big director he gave clues to and used it in important scenes. The movie has that way of storytelling that depends on lot's of camera angles and telling style that makes you in complete vision of it's details. The music of the movie was good but didn't give the scenes the intense or strengthen it. The acting was excellent by Hugh Jackman who performed the character of the father so well and was a very challenging role that he succeeded in it and by Jake Gyllenhaal who gave a solid performance as the police cop and the rest did a great job. The movie's problem is that it focused more on showing the suffering of the family and especially the father and on the cup trying to understand what's wrong with him doing some silly actions especially when he went to ask Alex in his home as If he would tell him!. The characters of his friend wasn't good and didn't add to the movie neither did his wife. The ending was acceptable though it not very good one but for the last scene of course with the hint of the small detail of his daughter. Overall, very violent , heart moving and has a lot of mystery in it. Don't miss a chance watching it.",

I felt that the film had cheated me a little, by presenting itself as one thing and delivering something very different. My initial sense of the film was that it would drift into something horrific and exploitative, but Villeneuve muddied things by bringing what I thought was a rather crass morality to bear on the second half of the film. By the time we are confronted with the true sadist of the film, we have been suitably chastised for our vengeful impulses. My overarching sense was that Villeneuve had worked out the ideas behind this film, the politics, at the detriment of either thrills or plausible characterisation.",

Jake is sympathetically dedicated and carries his role off convincingly. Paul Dano is actually suited to the dim wit.

119,18 October 2017,Pjtaylor-96-138044,9," A bleak, slow-burn of a thriller that manages to become one of the most affecting films of recent years.","'Prisoners (2013)' is a dark and, at times, disturbing slow-burn of a thriller that somehow manages to keep you on the edge of your seat with its bleak domestic ominousness and outbursts of futile yet explosive violence. That violence is representative of the volatile frustration of a fairly hopeless situation, one that can only bring out the very worst in even the very best of people; the characters are all simply scrambling to retain some semblance of control in the struggle for the survival of all that they hold dear. It's a picture which could seem somewhat inconsequential due to the slightly tangential nature of its plot, but the very human characters (all portrayed excellently, especially by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal who both turn in truly Oscar-worthy work) and thematically rich narrative manage to marry together all of the differing elements into a work which somehow feels entirely cohesive and incredibly powerful despite its long running time. It's one of the most affecting and emotional films of recent years, an accolade compounded by its brilliantly restrained direction and profoundly realistic screenplay. It's truly gripping. 9/10.",
120,28 July 2019,StonedMagician,8, Very Good: 8.5,"Prisoners is not a film that you leave saying ""that was a good time."" After a few minutes of tranquility, it becomes relentlessly bleak, quickly making the leap from a nice Thanksgiving dinner to detective work, torture, and suicide in a disturbingly deft fashion. Prisoners reminded me of the old David Fincher films, of the ilk of Fight Club and Se7en, with gradually unraveling plotlines told through cold and subdued cinematography. In a few ways, this is really just another thriller; a multitude of shots of people frantically hurrying about, and an antagonist's motivation that comes off as laughable. But there are plenty of movies that put tired cliches to good use, and Prisoners is one of them. In spite of all this, there is a handful of great performances at work, with Jackman in particular portraying a man barely holding on with chilling efficacy. It's not without its share of blemishes, and plays it a bit too safe in its depiction of the subject matter, but Prisoners is a dread-inducing, pure thriller with enough twists and turns to satisfy.",

The two and a half hour long movie takes the slow burn approach in telling the story, but that makes it even the better.

Let's just say I would not want to be on the receiving end of Hugh Jackman's fist. Hugh Jackman was torturing this guy (the weirdo from There will be Blood) for the entire movie. Jake G was good as the cop and where ever this was filmed had a really gritty feel about it. It rained all the time. What bothered me was how Terrence Howard cried or was watery eyed during the entire movie. Hugh Jackman had to convince him to not be a cry baby on more than one occasion. The lady, Ms. Jones, was played by a young actress which was really good to. Hugh Jackman and she get into it on more than one occasion. Was this movie long? yes. Was it good? Yes. Will Hugh Jackman get an Oscar nod? I sure hope so. This movie had a great plot and a protagonist and antagonist. Hugh Jackman started off the movie as a nice person but transitioned into a mad man. Good going Hugh Jackman. I look forward to more of these kinds of roles. Your Wolverine character is played out. Oh, and the ending? Well let's just say that the ENTIRE movie theater moaned. It was the most different ending ever. Very similar to how the Sopranos series ended. Jake Bass would like this movie. Hugh Jackman is awesome.",

While this is one of the best movies of the year and I honestly think Oscar nominations are not a long shot this movie leaves you feeling tense and uneasy the entire time. The fact that there is very little music helps create the tension it is going for. While this is a great movie and a must see this isn't one you can watch over and over due to the emotion and the way it makes you feel, especially if you are a parent.

They are inhumane creatures being portrayed as humane and no better example of this is the wife character thanking god for one of the most heinous atrocities an average human could conduct. The acting, while a touch over the top in scenes, is stellar, the cinematography is excellent and the directing superb, the writing is actually the let down, though it feels like it shouldn't be and most will be able to gloss over this as we the viewer tend to accept weaker writing so long as our emotional strings are being played eloquently.",

142,2 November 2013,matthewssilverhammer,7, A decent (if absurd) mystery that is gorgeously shot and competently told,"""Prisoners"" is a methodically paced mystery about two families desperately searching for their daughters who disappear on Thanksgiving Day. Many people (my wife included) will stay away from this film based on its premise alone, finding the misery too realistic. This is unfortunate because director Denis Villeneuve, writer Aaron Guzikowski and the cast of Hollywood heavyweights have created an engaging story that is really more focused on the mystery of the girls' disappearance than on the misery of it. Now, the script can be pretty heavy handed and far-fetched at times, but there is much more to praise. There are plenty of unexpected maze-like turns, some great sound editing, and ""Prisoners"" may hold the distinction as being the most beautiful film of the year. However, the movie's main draw for many people will be the cast, which is filled with powerhouse performances. While some of the actors may be bordering on melodrama, the acting throughout is darkly stellar. Above them all is a quiet but powerful performance from Gyllenhaal as the detective given the unenviable task of solving the puzzle. This may be the first film of the year that feels to be reaching for an Oscar or two. And with some strong performances, beautiful cinematography, and a dark twisted mystery (which the Academy loves), I wouldn't be surprised to see it pop up again next February during the big ceremony. ""Prisoners"" definitely delivers as a decent, if at times absurd, mystery that is gorgeously shot and skillfully told.",

149,18 January 2014,meeza,9," ""Prisoners"" is free from errors! Great thriller!","I am not going to write too many sentences on ""Prisoners"", so therefore I will set you free with not too many ""punalties"" on my behalf. However, I do have to commend Director Denis Villenueve's brilliant thriller about a desperate father's actions after his daughter is missing. Hugh Jackman delivers the best performance of his career as the Pennsylvania working-class father Keller Dover. On a Thanksgiving, Dover and his wife and two kids were celebrating the holiday at their best friends' home who are the Birches.; I guess those Sons of Birches could not just celebrate the holiday by themselves. Kidding! On that sad day, the Dovers' young daughter Anna and the Birches' young daughter Eve went missing; a mysterious RV parked in front of the Birches' home might have had something to do with it. When the driver of the RV named Alex Jones is arrested as a possible suspect, Keller goes all ""cray cray"" in order for the police not to release him even though there is not suffice evidence to book Jones. Jake Gyllenhaal co-stars as Detective Loki, who is not the real ""loco"" in the picture, but does get obsessed to solve the case and find the missing girls. Villenueve's direction was superb and some might argue that he was sadly missing in the list of Oscar- nominated film directors for 2013. Aaron Guzilowski's screenplay was pure, even though ""Prisoners"" sometimes got locked up with some clichés. It was great to see Jackman hide those big nails and singing voice, and transform himself into a character where he wore his emotions on his sleeve, and Hugh better believe that Jackman delivered the goods with his outstanding performance here. Gyllenhaal was also very good as Loki, as he continues his stellar acting career. Melissa Leo was stunning as the mysterious Aunt of Alex Jones; And speaking of Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones- Paul Dano delivered another effective cringe-worthy work as Alex Jones. Roger Deakins' cinematography of ""Prisoners"" was a scenic tour-de-force, even though I think that Deakins' ""arrested development"" of not getting the Oscars he deserves is a cinetragedy. OK, so I did write way too many pun-induced sentences for ""Prisoners"" after all; I guess that was a ""hard cell"" for you to believe I wouldn't. However, it is an easy sale for me to recommend the excellent ""Prisoners"". ***** Excellent",

No, he stopped being a person when he took our daughters.""","On the surface, Prisoners is an engaging mystery with some all-out brilliant performances from Jackman and Gyllenhaal alike. However, in its center, Prisoners is hardly just another dark thriller, but rather a exposition on the lengths people are willing to go, and the people they are because of it. I had been holding off on watching this one for a while now, not because I thought it would be bad or too long, in fact I nearly thought the opposite. I am a big fan of Villeneuve's and have been for a while now, and when I first heard of Prisoners and saw the trailer, I knew it was going to be something really special- and my expectations were correct. First off, the cinematography in this film is outstanding, not relying on beautiful fixtures, but just grounded and realistic angles that truly propel the film to a more integrated feel. However, this is hardly the best thing about the movie, despite the Oscars thinking so. The fact that neither Jackman nor Gyllenhaal received even a nomination for this film is a crime. I like Matthew McConaughey as much as the next guy, and I thought Dicaprio was fantastic in Wall Street (in fact he should have won), but Jackman and Gyllenhaal put just as much effort (if not more) into their performances and it is really dumbfounding to me how they got so little credit. Villeneuve's directing style may be criticized as dark and depressing for some, but I feel it was just the right amount for the situation at hand, and yet never too much where the film felt it was overbearing to watch. The score is excellent, its endlessly entertaining, and I was able to keep myself engaged throughout its entire nearly 3 hour runtime. In the end, Prisoners is an excellent must see thriller with excellent performances and excellent direction throughout (not to mention writing), don't miss this one.

I think that was easily the most brilliant crime thriller I have ever seen. I suspected that Prisoners could potentially be a terrific film and I was so pleased to discover that it is exactly that. I don't mean to say it was good as Se7en but it absolutely holds its own. There were some truly outstanding performances (and a couple of underwhelming ones), but the best part of this film was the script. What a brilliantly crafted, artistic, stunning film filled with symbolism, twists, turns and darkness. The film clocks in at a lengthy 2 1/2 hours but I didn't think it dragged at all. The pacing was consistent and I can't imagine any aspect of the film not being there in order to tell the full story. The clues added up, the twists made sense and I was able to put together the story and figure it out even before it was revealed (which is unusual for me.) But I mean that to be a good thing. As a movie goer you are privy to every detail and clue. This is absolutely not a typical mainstream film. Critics are raving about it and for good reason! ",

It's a Dark disturbing movie that drips with atmosphere from almost the very beginning. Each of the ensemble cast is terrific and is or ends up being a prisoner in some way whether it be to grief,morality,fear etc. Jackman has never been better and his wife's cries of him not being able to be the protector she thought he was really sets him in motion to do everything in his power to do just that. He does what he thinks the law is not doing and puts his morality aside and becomes a vigilante and while disturbing, has you question what you might do in those circumstances. Gyllenhaal is excellent as well and brings several layers of method acting to bring Lokki to life as a determined overworked and somewhat quirky detective who works tirelessly to find the missing girls. The Puzzle pieces are set in place and there are a few red herrings as well that will leave you enthralled to the very end. The ending was perfect in my opinion and begs the question are you glass full or half empty. Keller Dover's dream of his daughter gives him a lifeline and Lokkis determination give a sliver of a chance at a happy outcome or is the maze unsolvable like book. Hauntingly perfect.",

Visually striking (can Denis Villeneuve direct movies any other way) and moody ride. Yet, this is one of those movies where the story itself is overshadowed by the complexities and deeds of the characters. As a viewer, I was more interested in the people and their problems than the actual mystery in the story. Purely storywise 'Prisoners' is not very inventive, although the screenplay is masterfully written, and all the twists are well thought out. Characters and their actions are believable and their reactions relatable (I guess we can never give enough accolades for the superb cast in this one).

It's puzzling because it is technically not set in a prison nor the main characters are actually prisoners. The best thing to presume is it's a metaphorical term that might refer to the characters' imprisonment to the bleakness of their situation.

The writer, director and cast all make the movie so real, it's just magnificent. The musical score is perfect, setting the mood and atmosphere and gives us a true mystery and thriller feel. The director, Denis Villeneuve showed how good an director he is with the visual story telling and that is where the movie is strongest. Cinematography is insanely good, one thing I liked was the long shots as it gave the actors to really act and be the character which they did and provided emotion to the roles. This movie will always have a strong place in my heart as one of my favorite movies and also one of the movies that made me gain interest in psychology and criminology.

176,3 May 2014,brando647,8, A Powerful Tale that Blurs the Line Between Right/Wrong,"There was so much positive buzz when PRISONERS premiered on the festival circuit that I really expected it to have some presence at awards time. As the father of a little girl, I had a little extra bias settling in to watch this movie because the idea of a father in a desperate search for his missing daughter is a terrifying thought. PRISONERS did not disappoint on any front: the story, the acting, the tension. It's a movie that grips you at the beginning and doesn't let go until the end credits begin to roll. It's a dark little film that touches on the blurring of right and wrong and what is acceptable to save the life of someone you love. PRISONERS begins on Thanksgiving as the Dovers and the Birch family come together to celebrate. The youngest daughters of each family, Anna and Joy, go outside unattended and disappear without a trace. The only clue was a beaten old RV that had been seen driving around the neighborhood. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to locate the missing girls and the RV is traced to Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a man with the mental faculties of a ten-year-old child. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) believes Jones knows where his daughter is being kept and, when Loki and the police aren't working fast enough, he takes matters into his own hands. He grabs Jones and locks him away in an old abandoned family home and begins his own investigation. Every minute counts as Loki and Keller race to find the missing girls before it's too late.",

The director, Dennis Villeneuve has put together a serviceable story with infused emotions and great settings. The closest movie I can think of that has a kindred spirit to this is ""Winters Bone"". Both rely heavily on hostile and dark woodsy settings. The mystery comes together fair enough, but the actors take this movie up to a solid 7/10. Recommended.",

Success is no guarantee but it's at least a mainstream opportunity. I haven't seen Denis Villeneuve's Incendies just yet, though it's definitely on my list, but it must have been really good to grant him not only one film but two, with this years Prisoners and next years Enemy, both starring Jake Gyllenhaal. On that note, Zodiac comparisons are the first to come to mind. Not only is it a dreary world, reliably shot by Roger Deakins, but they share similar pace and structure in its very procedural method of plot delivery. Unfortunately, and again similarly, the pace is too slow. Everything it does could have been squeezed into two hours rather than two and a half. The problem is down to the editing. Its rhythm is constantly the same, feeling like it's always building and never paying off. Scenes cut away far too early and it then it jumps along the plot. Sure, I'm sure the consequences are implied, but there's the desperate need to see them. It's frustrating and impossible to feel immersed.",

182,11 November 2013,antoniotierno,8, riveting thriller,"Prisoners is marked by very strong performances and many moral/religious complexities. The story brings basically many ethical and moral questions: what would you do to protect your family? Would you torture someone to detract information? Jackman juggles these moral queries in an emotionally gripping performance. In Keller you have the tortured father who could not protect his child. In Loki you have the guardian of a community who has sworn to protect and serve. It's not surprising to see such religiosity in a film of incredible and uncompromising darkness. Villeneuve makes everything work, with an experience stimulating on an emotional and spiritual level. Thrillers like this should be embraced. Prisoners proves compelling, thanks also to the subject matter that practically demands emotional investment from an audience: children in peril. The film's pace is an endurance test, an excessive 2 and a half hours runtime but everyone gets to share in the dread of the final revelations. Does the end justify the means? All in all it's rare to find a film that really works on all levels, but that's exactly what Denis Villeneuve's and his cast have constructed with Prisoners.",
183,5 October 2015,Screen_Blitz,9," Uncompromising and powerful in its portrayal of moral ambiguity, Prisoner is an outstanding psychological thriller that dares to leave an impact","Children being abducted is every parent's worst nightmare. Facing such an unfavorable circumstance can be quite frightening, if not devastating. What kind of testament of a father seeking for justice against the evil doer who kidnaps his child can French-Candian director Denis Villenueve bring to this powerful whiplash of a psychological thriller? Prisoners is a movie that grabs the heart and dares not the let go while challenges viewers with moral complexities and one of the powerful jabs at ""what would you do"" circumstances. Uncompromising and packed with a brutal punch of suspense of psychological weight that is nearly impossible to resist, the film plays no game when testing the audiences' expectations and wringing out psychological elements to dare to think hard long after the end credits roll. One thing is sure, and that is Denis Villenueve shares no room for comfort or easy answers for the characters or the situation surrounding them. And that is only part of what makes this piece shine. Set during the Thanksgiving holidays, the film focuses on Keller Dover (played by Hugh Jackman) and his wife Grace (played by Mario Bello) who invite their friends Franklin (played by Terrence Howard) and Nancy Birch (played by Viola Davis) over for dinner. The families two young daughters Anna and Joy, both six-years-old, go outside to play. Before they know, the girls are nowhere to be found. Upon contacting the police, the families get help from Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) to search for them. Who the man ends up finding is Alex Jones (played by Paul Dano), a mentally impaired man who owns a RV the girls were climbing, and takes him into custody. Due to the lack of evidence from his mental disability, the police believe him to be innocent and let him go. Keller, however, is not buying it and decides to take matters into his own hands. ",
184,20 October 2013,Troy_Campbell,7, Just shy of brilliant.,"You may think this film is your typical Tinseltown thriller - thanks to its impressive A-list cast - but don't be fooled; this is a dark, unrelenting tale that cares more about posing moral questions within its murky world than it does about providing narrative twists and turns. Aaron Guzikowski's screenplay delivers grim by the barrel-load, but also intelligence and maturity, whilst Denis Villeneuve's direction is haunting and suggestive without being manipulative or overwrought. Hugh Jackman is front and centre as Keller Dover, the distraught father who will do anything to find his abducted daughter, and he's given credible support by Maria Bello, Terrence Howard and Voila Davis, although it's Jake Gyllenhaal as the loner cop in charge of the disturbing case who is the standout. So far so good, yet there's one major drawback that stops this gritty affair being brilliant: its length. At two and a half hours long, a large chunk of its power is lost with a bloated middle act that should've had 30 minutes shaved off in the editing suite. Prisoners is a Zodiac-esque thriller that requires a strong emotional resolve, your undivided attention and a pre-movie toilet stop.",

It kind of had those Hollywood bubblegum trappings. Boy was I wrong. This is a very dark and powerful story that examines the psyches of many different and diverse characters. Probably what stands out the most are the incredible performances by all of the actors here, but especially Hugh Jackman, who delivers an Academy worthy performance. Jackman's character is a walking contradiction, he cloaks himself in every kind of religious regalia he can, while at the same time showing absolutely no confidence in his fellow man. When adversity enters his life, he ends up abandoning all of his supposed beliefs in order to save his family. Paul Dano is also excellent as the mysterious Alex Jones, an eccentric person that Jackman's Dover character is sure has taken his daughter. Gylenhall plays the deliberate and deductive detective that like every other character in this movie, is dealing with some demons of his own. This story is tight and excellently directed, every scene is chalked full of relevant information that will revel the greater understanding later.

I admit as a lawyer I am biased against these kind of movies where suspects are tortured beaten senseless and arrested with zero probable cause. That Jackman would make this movie after his magnificent performance in Lez Miz could only have been for the money. His role is a one-dimensional idiot without intelligence who gets it wrong from the beginning. Jake G has the worst role as stupid numbskull cop who hasn't a clue as to what is going on. I didn't give a fig about the parents, or their kids. There was zero background on what kin of parents and kids they were. This was not even a bad TV movie, it was a waste of time. Its length is inexcusable, its plot beyond idiotic and its actors were like very bad run of the mill nobodies. They all should be ashamed of themselves--the writer, director actors and everyone else.

The rescued girls did not mention the pit, but they must have been conscious there at times (or surely would have died if dropped in that distance if unconscious) and would have recounted that horrific experience. Thus the police would have gone there to search for the pit, especially when Keller was missing. 3. It seems improbable that the first rescued girl would not have mentioned that they did go into the RV and, perhaps also, that a woman was involved at some point (I am sure she would not always have been disguised enough or said so little that it was not detectable); these clues would have sent the police to Holly's/Alex's house for a very detailed search. 4. Keller went to Holly's house fully suspecting she was the kidnapper; he had a gun but chose to keep his back to Holly for an overly long period (in fact, until she had the chance to produce her own gun!). A sensible person would have gone there with his gun out (he was already in plenty of trouble over the beating of Alex so this would have been a criminal risk he was willing to take). 5. Detective Loki drove at high speed with a bullet wound to the head to get Anna to hospital asap and narrowly missed several accidents (apart from the fact he may have fallen unconscious) and may have killed Anna and himself; he could have phoned the hospital and met an ambulance part way! 6. The derelict house owned by Keller would have been mentioned to the police at an earlier stage; anyway, the impression given was that the police accepted quite readily that Alex must have run away (and also later Keller), both cases in spite of this being a kidnapping case! Little serious effort went into finding these two missing persons.",

202,7 August 2015,barryrd,9, Sombre and eerie masterpiece,"A very sombre and eerie story, the music, dark locations, run-down houses and wounded characters left me with a feeling of foreboding. The apparent kidnapping of two children immediately thrusts two families into a crisis in the middle of their Thanksgiving get-together. The rest of the movie deals with the fallout for families, police, neighbours, suspects, etc. and the suspense is tight enough to grip the audience until the end. The leading characters are played by Hugh Jackman, as Keller Dover, the father of one of the children, and Jake Gyllenhall, as Detective Logi, the man assigned to the case. Dover is a man of strength and ferocity who sees his purpose in life to defend and protect his wife and family from harm. When this particular crisis hits, his one objective is to rescue his daughter unharmed and nothing will stop him, even taking the law into his own hands. This leads to a some horrific scenes with the immediate suspect, a young man with a limited intelligence played by Paul Dano and his mother played by Melissa Leo. Maria Bello plays Dover's wife with Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as the parents of the second child. The detective uses every resource available to try to locate the children. Detective Loki is a low-key but determined police officer who cannot keep Keller Dover from flying into a continuous rage over the time it takes to find the kidnap victims. The final scene and ambiguous ending left a bit of a question mark. The strange sequence of events is a dark look at how people react to one horrific event but it contains elements of heroism. Denis Villeneuve has directed what I consider a brilliant movie.",

Nothing to add, nothing to cut off. I would not mind if this movie lasted 5 hours (about a double as it does), revealing more details, but the director decided to leave the viewer some dots to connect. Everything else in this movie is just right.

The cast is the big draw, and they do deliver, Jackman is always a true professional, and Gyllenhaal keeps trying to be more than the roll needs though he does still deliver a solid performance. It is nothing like Taken, even though they sort of sell it that way. It is a long movie, almost 2 hours and 20 minutes before credits roll.

It isn't Jake Gyllenhalls finest film much preferred him in end of watch but it is a solid performance. Paul Dano is excellent in his portrayal of the prime suspect & the film builds up a true sense of menace & suspense leading to its conclusion. The miserable setting a weather adds to the undoubted despair of the characters & the direction is solid.

However, that is furthest from the truth. Prisoners packs one hell of a punch, giving the audience not only something very entertaining, but also something very human in the process. The film plays out more like Seven, Zodiac and Mystic River, allowing the audience inside the mind of Keller Dover, a man searching for his daughter while teetering on the brink of insanity. The story kicks off when the Dover and Birch families are celebrating Thanksgiving. What seems like a normative celebration quickly descends into a frantic search for two young girls. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal)arrives at the Dover house after the abduction and soon finds a suspect in Paul Dano's character. But as time passes without finding the girls, Dano is finally let go. Much to his dismay, Keller Dover takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps the suspect, subjecting him to brutal torturous methods as he searches for the truth in finding his daughter. What makes Prisoners so well crafted is the performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, both of whom are at the top of their game in this film. The chemistry between these two actors is impeccable, bringing a natural presence to the screen. The supporting cast, including an unrecognizable Melissa Leo, is superb. Viola David, Maria Bello and Paul Dano also give caliber performances, and keep the film entertaining just on their performances alone.",

It delivers the perfect atmosphere for a crime theme as it thrills us and provokes our thoughts all along. Scriptwriters have chosen to have two main characters: Jackman as the father and Gyllenhaal as the detective. Since the film's structure is dramatic instead of thematic (in which case the script should focus mainly on the relationship of two characters) this could seem a bit of problem for the audience to get into the movie. Although this is not the case thanks to the common goal of the characters: Finding the girls.

The performances were incredibly powerful and emotionally rich, and every character had a motive for what drove them to resolve the pain and grief they were going through... caused by a terrifying situation. Hugh Jackman plays one of the fathers whose child was kidnapped in broad daylight, Jake Gyllenhaal plays the detective, and when the two characters interact/clash... it is very unnerving and highly intense.

Prisoners presented sophisticated cinematography, a riveting screenplay, flawless storytelling, and authentic character development while also being a thrilling, engaging, and somber crime film... which balances every aspect of filmmaking with ease and professionalism.

And it's impossible to tell on the description which way this one it will play out. It's not that it's a pretentious, wordy, artsy-fartsy snooze fest - but it is heavy, it is dark, and it is a thriller/drama. Be warned.

260,26 October 2013,eonbluedan-1,8," Grim, gripping, great performances. Not a masterpiece.","Aaron Guzikowski's screenplay for 'Prisoners' was near the top of the list of best unmade for quite some time; at one point Hugh Jackman was attached to the project, but dropped out for reasons that remain unclear, though scheduling conflict may not be quite as pertinent as a lack of artistic cohesion with the original director. As serendipity would have it, the much later arrival of Denis Villeneuve as director, to his first English language feature, drew a mega cast of great talent, both in front of and behind the camera, including Jackman again. This is presumably based on the acknowledgement of his previous Award-nominated work. With Villeneuve on board, the screenplay seemed destined to become so much more than your average abduction thriller; to a great extent this fact is both the strength, and arguably the weakness of the final product.",

262,22 September 2013,triskelsey,8, Emotionally Raw,"Prisoners is the kind of movie that has little to no action, but is more of a watch to see details and listen closely dialogue. It starts out joyful and happy, almost immediately it is filmed (and acted) so that it is incredibly realistic and relatable. Things change drastically when the two little girls just vanish into thin air. Now, I won't give away spoilers because I don't want to ruin this movie for anybody but let me tell you this, it is incredibly wrong and at times a little slow but it holds true to the realism of these kind of events. You bite your nails wondering where the children are and you begin to doubt if Hugh Jackman is doing the right thing by abducting (and torturing) a boy who he thinks took the girls. Each parent is shown as they spiral downward from fear, anger and loss. Jake Gyllenhaal gives his best performance as Detective Loki, his bad ass attitude slowly chipping away into desperation. The movie may not be the best out there but emotionally, it makes you question how far you would go to find the person you love and just how hard will you cling to the belief that you are right.",

I must say, I heard a lot about this film before watching it, I even read the reviews. Everything about it lived up to my expectations. What I was expecting to see was a film that would keep me at the edge of my seat, which it literally did, a film that would have me guessing all the way through, which I tried really hard not to do but did anyway, and finally a film that -as a friend had told me- would have a predictable ""twist"", which it sort of did. This is a very good action/thriller/drama kind of film that really manages to capture you from the very beginning and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout. It's not that we have not seen stuff like this before; kidnapping movies tend to be ubiquitous, but there is something about this one that stands out.

Villeneuve and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski were able to elevate the material, making Prisoners into an intense thriller about a father exploring his dark side so he can find his daughter, a police procedural about the investigation, and a family drama about a family struggling with the disappearance. Prisoners was a bleak film that worked as a character study and allowed many talented actors really juicy roles.",

272,3 September 2018,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,7, A great character-driven crime film.,"This was a gloomy crime film, directed by the Canadian Dennis Villeneuve (''Blade Runner 2049'', ''Arrival''), and is an experience not for the faint of heart, as it deals with every parent's nightmare: the abduction of their children. Hugh Jackman delivers a solid performance as the father of the family who is willing to cross any ethical boundary in order to find his kids and restore the serenity in his household. Jake Gyllenhaal is great as the persistent cop who swears to solve the case even if that means risking his own life. The chemistry between the angry and suspicious father and the police officer who asks him not to meddle with the case is the driving force moving the plot forward because ''Prisoners'' is more of a character-driven drama than an action thriller, which places the emphasis on the emotions of the devastated parents and the obsessiveness of the detective. The rest of the cast acts pretty decent and overall ''Prisoners'' should be on the top-10 of crime films for the last five years. Highly recommended!",
273,22 January 2014,CMTiago,9, Dark and cold thriller that nails the mark.,"Prisoners is the type of movie that is getting less and less recurrent in Hollywood and a must-see for anybody that enjoys a thriller that doesn't reach exaggerated proportions. Morally challenging and provoking, this is a story about how to handle a dire situation such as the disappearance of two young children. The two main characters provide us with very different scopes of this dilemma. On one hand Jackman's Dover is an emotional driven man who while acknowledging his wrong doings, doesn't restrain himself and goes past any boundaries to ensure his family's safety. On the other hand Gyllenhaal's Loki is a detective that not only shows determination to succeed in another case, but grows to be defined by it, as even he will boil under pressure. The performances are astonishing from these two men and you feel their tribulations throughout the film, whether it's Jackman's descent into near madness or Gyllenhaal's anxiety as he pursues every lead possible. Director Denie Villenueve provides us with a moody setting that not only attracts us to this shadowy story, but also connects with all aspects provided with his co-workers such as a fantastic cinematography work and a striking script that will fill with as much doubt as the characters in the movie. My only complaint is that I thought it ran a bit too long and a little sharper editing would have been fine with me, since not only would I rate it higher, but also would have had an even better experience. Having watched the film, I can only say that is deserving of its recognition (IMDB Top 250) and I hope I get to see more movies churned out like these.",

But when the movie gets over 8 on IMDb,with class A actors, my expectations get higher and I KNOW i will see a great thriller/drama. Except not! Instead I get over 2 hours of lame, slow drama that insults quality movie directing, story writing, because here motifs are predictable and not placed properly and narrative seems to be filled with plot holes, redundant characters and dead end situations. Unnecessary delays don't build good suspense, but rage and disappointment of the viewer. In this case 29-year-old mum, that somehow found enough time to watch good movie on Monday evening. What went wrong with the world where suddenly movies like TWILIGHT SAGA, HUNGER GAMES....and books like 50 SHADES OF GRAY and series like SLEEPY HOLLOW (what's up with that!?) became right measure for quality and good smart entertainment!?

The movie is 2 and a half hours long, and I would say it benefits from it. It allows the plot to unfold at a good pace. It never feels rushed. This film will always have you guessing who is behind the kidnappings and how the film will play out, which is a good trait for a thriller/mystery movie. It also wraps the story up fairly well.

Roger Deakins' stunning cinematography really helps in crafting this atmosphere, as like the film, it moves at a slow and often languorous pace, occasionally honing in on things that don't necessarily move the plot forward, but add to the mood.

I think that this film belongs to the category of ""one time"" films. The cast of the film is great. The acting is great. Hugh Jackman gave his best. But Jake Gyllenhaal somehow did not hook me, although I like the actor. There are some illogical things in the film, but if not for these illogical things, the ending would be completely different.

This psychological labyrinth covers multiple layers of how people are prisoners in their own complicated world. The film thoroughly and informatively explores all the character perspectives with refined detail, however in instances this tight grasp the story has on depicting the explicit stress each person displays perhaps gets in the way of a fluent, coherent story line.

Unpleasant but undeniably gripping effort with strong performances, though the locale--a rainy blue collar town (shot mostly in Georgia)--fails to come to life. Cars race around through different neighborhoods and we lose our bearings, which may be the fault of director Denis Villeneuve. There's also some awkward confusion over the initial suspect's arrest: he's held and then released, he's conveniently catatonic in the police station but mutters something odd to the angry father out in the parking lot, he can't pass a lie detector test without understanding the questions yet he has a driver's license. There's also some fudging by screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski, who would rather toss in trunks full of snakes and mazes on the walls then tell us how some crazy acting man managed to get two rambunctious little girls into his camper.

The film doesn't necessarily succeed at being epic, but it is terrifically well-paced for clocking-in at over a two-and-a-half hour runtime—director Villeneuve does an excellent job using fade-outs to skip passed the obvious melodrama. The story involves emotions and chills from all aspects of an unthinkable crime, including: the family members of the abducted children, the investigators and even those close to the suspect. Unfortunately, the movie is dragged by too many obvious detective blunders by Gyllenhaal's characters: 1) Whaaa? I can't discreetly park my car in the middle of the road in broad daylight? 2) Whaaa? I'm going to have all family members take a polygraph, but not consider looking into the fact that one of the fathers owns an abandoned building the girls may be at? 3) Whaaa?

Detective Jake Gyllenhaal is assigned to the case and quickly finds the driver of a mysterious RV that had been seen in the neighborhood, a severely retarded man (Paul Dano). There's no evidence whatsoever that Dano did anything, but Jackman leaches onto him, refusing to believe the police in the matter. He soon kidnaps Dano and attempts to torture the truth out of him. The theme of compromised morality is powerful, and Jackman is great in this role.

Though it is a kidnapping thriller, I feel that thrill is lesser, the torture is more and suspense is unnecessarily stretching for a long way. 2.33 hours movie is very lengthy to such an average plot. only last 20 minutes will entertains you with shocking twist and stupidly uncompleted end. I wonder to see 8.1 rating for such lengthy and mostly boring movie even good acting by Hugh Jackman. But me impressive acting done by Jake Gyllenhaal in the role of detective. Climax suspense revealing is not well justified. End is not clear. Overall It is a very slow kidnap drama with lesser thrill and more boring with extra dose of torture. One thing is also me bother that there is no good looking actress in such boring drama to relief you as there are at least a beautiful actress in almost every Hollywood boring movies. If you are regular viewer of movies then you can realise.",

First i found this movie to be a bit too long and was a bit boring at the moments. However i did like the acting and atmosphere was dark and completely suitable for this movie and this story.Loved also the drama and how they showed the emotions of a family struck by this misery of a daughter being kidnapped and not knowing how to help her or find her. But at some points the story is too slow for my taste,and then the ending was somewhat disappointing for me. I couldn't say that this movie is predictable and that you know from the start how it is going to end, but it has crossed my mind several times during the movie who the kidnapper is and turned out to be that i was right. All in all i would recommend it but with precaution and must point out once again that the movie is actually slow although a lot of people seem to think that every scene is important, i believe that they actually needed to cut some scenes and the story had to move faster.",

I won't give away the plot with the review, just to say if you are a parent you better come prepared. Its the movie you will want to see a 2nd time to pick up the clues you missed the first time. You are drawn into the movie and remain gripped the whole way. The story line and the twists make it a very good movie. Of course you have some well know actors as you can see from the trailer. Its not classed as a horror movie, however for there are horrific aspects. Anyway as I see from the 8 score I am not the only one who liked the movie. It could easily win an Oscar as one of the best pictures of 2013. I suppose its good to see a movie that is suburban with drama and good acting. Brilliant.",
319,31 May 2020,martinrey-15593,10, Classic Gritty Thriller.,"An edge of your seat thriller is a term used too loosely but for prisoners this term is definitely applicable.
It's one of the most engrossing movies of this kind i've seen for a while.
It's best not to read the plot beforehand, just watch it.
It's dark and disturbing and has many twists and turns with ample red herrings thrown in to keep you guessing til near the end.
The only criticism is that one character goes a little overboard but this is a movie so its allowed a little slack especially when it adds to the tension..
Great cast all round make this a must see movie and it's pretty bewildering why there was only 1 Oscar nomination for this movie especially when you see the competition for that year.
Prisoners is an excellent stand out thriller and theres not much else to say apart from watch it.",
320,21 December 2013,pcrprimer,9, Intense drama-thriller with powerhouse performances by Jackman and Gyllenhaall,"This is a 2 and a half hour movie that takes the viewer on an intense viewing experience. Jackman shines in his role of a father who has had his daughter abducted. Gyllenhaall plays a more subdued hotshot detective, and also delivers a very strong performance. It would have been nice to find out more about his character since he doesn't fit the typical mould of a detective with the neck tattoos and tattoos on his fingers. However, that would have detracted the focus of the movie. The constantly rainy and overcast weather also gave it a very depressing atmosphere that worked well with the nature of the plot. Melissa Leo and Paul Dano both impressed in their supporting roles. The use of some camera shots was very memorable with the way the framing. The framing of Paul Dano's character's eye in the shower stands out in terms of framing. The only thing that prevents me from giving this movie a higher score was the script was not as powerful as the directing and acting. In retrospect, I can recall shots and scenes that stand out but not any specific lines.",

Having just watched ""Prisoners"", I was surprised to see that Villeneuve directed it. I was also disappointed. I won't deny that it's a very intense movie, but I will say that the dads' actions seem excessive. It looks like the sorts of things that Liam Neeson now does in movies (and his current characters seem to be based on Harrison Ford's characters). I'll admit that I didn't figure out what was going to happen as the movie progressed, but that doesn't make up for the extreme actions taken by the dads. The point is that this is not a movie that I recommend. In addition to the director, each of the main cast members has done better movies.",

But I will focus mainly on the storyline. Indeed, the plot is worth of admiration. As the movie passes, there are a lot of plot twists and moments filled with tension. But even though there were a lot of unexpected turns, some scenes were pretty monotone, and the movie atmosphere is really exhausting and dark. A lot was happening and in some moments I felt like there was too much things going on. Reading the reviews here, I found some plot holes too but again, I think that was because there were too many things going on on screen and some characters actions got confused.

The story, the plot, the screenplay, the acting, the direction, the set everything is perfect and is comparable only to the legendary 'Silence of the lambs'. I generally do not dare to compare any movie to the later but i am just compelled to mention this here. For a movie to be this good everything has to come together. If the story does not pack the punch than no matter how many dollars the producer spends on the movie it can't become legendary. Prisoners is an excellent story which is fully complemented by the acting performances of Jackman, Gyllenhaal and every other cast member. Paul Dano (little miss sunshine) who plays the character Alex is worth a special mention here. He plays a disturbed kid in this movie and is essential to the maintenance of suspense and he does it seamlessly. I urge you to watch this movie in the theaters. It makes sense to encourage and appreciate brilliance which today is so rare in the movie business.",

After watching the film I do understand why. ""Prisoners"" is way too long movie (153 minutes) - almost like compiled TV mini-series - with lot of plot problems from the various twists and turns shown in the film. Movie isn't bringing much new to the tradition of crime thrillers and missing children horror stories too. The film's best quality is the atmosphere, while actors like Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo and Maria Bello are wasted, mainly due to thin characterization. An ineffective ending leaves you with the feeling of wasted time, too. In terms of a recommendation, it's a borderline call. On second viewing (year after) I realized that I forgot almost whole movie which means that, no matter how engrossing story is, its too familiar script makes you not to memorize it. I did like it of first viewing (Rating: 7) but on second (Rating: 6-) I did realized how much script holes, gimmick acting, underwhelming script it had.

Conversely, Hugh Jackman's performance, while good, is just a little over the top. An emotionally powerful performance doesn't always involve screaming at the top of your lungs in every scene and unfortunately that's the lasting impression I had from him here. ",

Director Denis Villeneuve and writer Aaron Guzikowski know their beans when it comes to understanding what make our well-meaning but sometimes very sick society tick. The cast is deep and talented. Hugh Jackman's frantic father adds yet another dimension to the seemingly endless capabilities of this actor. Maria Bello, Viola Davis and Terence Howard as the other parents involved in the developing tragedy are contained, believable and never anything but excellent. Jake Gyllenhaal's typically realistic, understated turn as the skeptical cop is perfect counterpoint. Paul Dano's hapless nut case almost steals the show, and Melissa Leo's turn as his ""keeper"" is downright frightening. I recommend this film without reservation. And Oscars _ wake up!",

It's exquisitely told without modern-day-film tricks like shaky cameras; without an actor saying ""the F word"" in every other sentence; without a dub-step sound track; and without gratuitous frights or even unnecessary action or car chases. It's a story of a horrible kidnapping and those who are affected. It's told with such compassion and believability. The characters make excruciating choices --choices that make you shake your head in stunned wonder. And the cast! Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano! How much acting chops can one get on a movie set? And the screenplay is superb.

Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), the father of one of the girls, isn't convinced of Jones's innocence, and he vows to do whatever is necessary to bring the girls home. Villeneuve's thriller is anything but fast-paced (it runs for a whopping two and a half hours), but it's certainly never boring. The inflated running time allows for greater character development (specifically of Loki and Keller Dover), and invites us to dwell on the moral ambiguities of Dover's quest.

Gripping crime drama centered on a dual child abduction with both the law and family flummoxed to the point of extremes in finding the truth and justice (and the blind spots along the way) as the clock ticks to an inevitable climax of the point of no return. Excellent cast and a pinpricking screenplay by Aaron Guzikowski galvanized what could've been a run-of-the-mill vengeance melodrama thanks largely to shrewd and unnerving direction by Denis Villeneuve who generously takes his time in allowing enough rope for his audience to either hang onto (or hang themselves) from the utmost horror - the unknown. Jackman and Gyllenhaal give career performances as one of the aggrieved fathers and the insularly dogged police detective who share the common bond: the truth.",

387,2 July 2014,burlesonjesse5,7, VIEWS ON FILM review of Prisoners,"Produced by busy bee actor Mark Wahlberg and helmed by acclaimed Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, Prisoners is the type of vehicle that is perfect for fall movie going season. It was filmed in Georgia (which I believe, was made to look like a drab part of Pennsylvania), takes place during Thanksgiving, and harbors a non-stop sense of doom and gloom from its opening frame (I think the sun shined maybe once during the entire 2 and a half hour running time). Listen, I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you, this picture is long, feels long, and it really takes its time. Villeneuve uses old school filming techniques and doesn't project anything flashy at all. The story, when it's all said and done however, is somewhat conventional. Therefore, I think it was necessary for the events to be drawn out and dragged through the muck a little. Based on an initial viewing, I realized that Prisoners would have felt like a TV movie and/or a Law and Order episode if the running time was trimmed to say, an hour and a half. Thankfully, it comes off as an extended director's cut (I'm not the only critic that felt this way) and that to a fault, is what makes the flick work. Watching it, I was reminded of a David Fincher film (without Fincher's signature style though) and not just because it starred staggeringly disciplined actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Prisoners is basically a mild spawn of Fincher's Se7en and Zodiac. It's not quite as effectively creepy as those films, but it's definitely good enough to recommend. ",

390,25 October 2018,alexanderstephencraig,10, A gritty raw thriller,"This movie has been out for a long time. However I love it and wanted to write a review. The film itself has a fantastic dark tone. The ideal itself is fantastic. At it's core the film asks you a question about your own morals. ""What would you do if your child was in danger?"" There are characters representing different sides of the decision to answer the core question itself. I for one would probably lean towards Hugh Jackman but that's beyond the point.
There is something incredibly entertaining in watching Hugh Jackman's change in character from the start of the film to the end of the film.
I also appreciate a stand-alone film. There is much to gain from sequels. However this keeps you wanting more, it tells an incredible story, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Not to mention how captivating the acting is to where you feel what the character is portraying on screen; that is a real film.
Without going into spoiler details, that's my pitch. If you honestly haven't seen this film you are missing out. Jackman and ghyllenhal's performance is enough of a sell but it has, as noted, everything else to make it the perfect film.",

395,13 November 2013,firejosh2010,8, Nerve Racking till the bitter end.,"This was a really good movie that I had little to no expectations going into the film which actually made for a better viewing. I think the trailer didn't really do this film justice in terms of how good it actually was. The cop played his role expertly well, he had that sense of a tense nature and one that would go all out to get what he wanted to get. I love the start of the movie and the taking as well as how it was hinted at. They did that so well and built it to such a great degree. The use of the rain when they went out to try and find them also really heightened the situation. The whole tale did drag on quite a long way, but I cannot say I was bored at any point. Yes, there were some loose ends which I didn't quite get as the movie went on in terms off several things that didn't really add much substance to the plot and a few things that in my opinion were a bit confusing, nonetheless, the role of the sub plots and the smaller characters was once more done well and each of them really fitted the type of play they were in. The ending to the movie really opens up the chance on more of this but to be honest, I don't see where they can go. Probably would have score 7.75 for me but will round that to 8.",
396,12 October 2019,badassarcher,8, Thriller cinema done right !,"Denis Villeneuve yet again delivers a well crafted piece of art , not only is the story captivating , but it's full of symbolism , psychology and everything that in my mind makes a film great and communicates a strong message to the audience .
I've known Villeneuve through his Sci-Fi works ( Arrival - Blade Runner 2049 ) and decided to give this movie a chance , I have to say I was in for a lovely surprise , the guy made a Fincher-esque psychological movie without losing his signature .
Tension is so dominant in the movie it's almost a character , the nature of the characters being morally different ( which can be observed through their reactions , behaviors and acts ) makes for a very suspenseful experience which is amplified thanks to the actors' performances ( espiecially Hugh Jackman who was very intense in some scenes ) .
The movie deals brilliantly with moral dilemmas and other philosophical concepts such as egoism , altruism , nihilism , the good and bad spectrum or whether these two exist at all , the movie also had its share of religious symbolism and imagery to portray mainly the effect faith has in people ( or lack thereof ) and the consequences of these faith based acts .
All in all , this movie is a must for any fan of cinema and thrillers , and Villeneuve is becoming more and more of an S-list director",

406,14 November 2014,brchthethird,10, A beautiful and brooding masterpiece,"PRISONERS is an intense, unforgettable look at how far people go to protect the ones they love. Excellent performances, beautiful cinematography and a haunting soundtrack combine to create one of the best films this year. The story is about two girls who are abducted, and the ensuing investigation. One of the parents (played by Hugh Jackman) is not satisfied with how the police are doing their job, and takes it upon himself to do some investigating of his own. What follows is a journey into the abyss and dark recesses of the human soul as the rules are bent (and broken) in an attempt to solve the mystery and find closure. I don't want to give anything else away, as that would severely reduce the emotional impact. This movie does what most can't, and maintains an almost unbearable level of tension throughout it's entire run time, which is about two and a half hours. Everyone of the leads is on their A-game, and bring such pathos to their characters that you can't help but identify and sympathize with them. Of course, who couldn't given the subject matter (unless you're a psychopath)? This is greatly enhanced by a lurking sense of dread conveyed brilliantly by the cinematography (courtesy of Roger Deakins, and deserving of an Oscar) and a haunting score. You just can't take your eyes off of the screen, and you'll never want to check your watch, it's that good. Overall, this is one of the best movies I've seen all year and I highly recommend you check it out...without kids present, preferably.",

Yes, the acting was good, but I hated the father's and the policeman's character as well, so I had nothing out of the good acting. :) Although there were some stunning looking scenes, the whole movie was dark and depressing, and I was surprised when I saw Roger Deakins as the director of photography. I just love his work and would give him not one but a couple of Oscars, but not for this one, it's not so impressive.

Except the writing is quite simplistic. Overlooking plot holes, the movie is enjoyable. But as many others have pointed out, after some deeper reflections, it is apparent how all the movie frame hangs from a tiny thread. The main point that prompts the whole succession of events is as unnecessary as is bad writing. Why is this guy not talking, not communicating after so much suffering.

The storyline has many varying layers, but most of them are not resolved by the end of the movie, so it keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat even after the credits.

The film is several steps above most other recent crime thrillers or revenge stories, deciding to not only be unforgettably intelligent with an intense story while being brilliantly grounded in reality, but to care as well. It's so potently riveting that I couldn't turn away from it until the first ending credit. I can't praise this film enough and I feel that it deserves to have the honor of being discussed as a potential awards contender starting with both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, who give what is perhaps the best performances of their careers as their character-driven roles as the two leads were raw, real and makes you start questioning about what would you do if you were ever put in the exact same position either character's shoes were in.",

Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, a man who will almost stop at nothing to find his daughter. His and Franklin Birch (played by Terrence Howard) are fathers caught between desperation and loss of ethics. As vigilantes, they take twisted justice into their own hands. As one amateur reviewer here suggests, it is an unusual thriller clouded by moral ambiguity.

However, it had many needless quirks and meaningless distractions and misdirections that it was difficult at times to follow what was necessary to the story and what was not. The highlight of the film was Hugh Jackman's character Keller, the stressed-out and angry father of one of two kidnapped little girls in Conyers, Georgia. This father's anger over losing his little girl drove the story and gave it its powerful energy that had all eyeballs glued to the screen throughout, which is the true +mark of a successful suspense story.",

438,25 September 2013,askewglasses,9, Prisoner of my Thoughts,"The film opens with Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) hunting with his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette). He utters a prayer as the deer wanders into the audience's vision. They say amen and Ralph shoots the deer. They drive home in heavy rain, while Keller gives his son a lecture about being prepared in life. They then return to home and the family goes to their neighbours for Thanksgiving dinner. He we are introduced to the very well written characters such as Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and his wife Nancy (Viola Davis). Both Keller and Terrence have young daughters around the same age, and they go outside to play. Keller's daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) asks her parents if she can go with Eliza (Zoe Soul), Terrence's daughter, back to her house to find her red whistle. But the family finds later she never asked her brother to come with her. They don't hear from the girls, and panic sets on. The girls are declared missing and it is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is put on the case. He finds a man who was near girls last known location and brings him in. His name is Alex (Paul Dano) but unfortunately isn't able to tell them much else. Without evidence he is released, but Keller is certain Alex took his daughter, and he won't stop until he can find his daughter by any means necessary. The movie may be slow for people, but it takes its time to develop strong characters and creates a sense of realism from the performances. Hugh Jackman's character is so well done I was reminded of the desperate man performances of the past like James Stewart in Vertigo (1958) or Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven (1992). It's a very enduring character that I believe will be remembered fondly in the years to come. Another interesting performance is by Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki. He's a Detective who cares about the case but is open to all possibilities as film goes on. Even his image with the slicked back hair and tattoos are rather different from the strong moral sense he exhibits. But aside from the performances the cinematography stands out. The director of photography, Roger Deakins, uses slow zooms and out focus backgrounds with great editing to create a unique visual experience. Visually it compares to Deakins' other work like Skyfall (2012) and No Country for Old Men (2007). In the end Prisoners work on multiple levels and is a great film to see in theatres.",

Ranging from story line to acting, you can't find a dull moment in this film to sit down and say ""I'm actually not enjoying myself"". This movie will keep you at the edge of your seat through it's 2-hour length and you will began to actually use your brain to follow the case along with Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) to find the two lost daughters. Going into this movie, I honestly didn't think I would like it. The previews looked suspenseful and I wanted to see a nice crime movie that I had never seen before, but once the credits started rolling I really had to sit back in my seat and think about what a mind-blowing experience it all is. This movie will keep you up at night just thinking about it, whether it gives you the creeps or a quick laugh over something that happened, this movie really impacts your life when you sit down and watch it in that dark room with your friends, family, or even by yourself. This is a dark movie, not one where you feel for the bad guy or where the good guy gets taken and you hear the life story of the villain, this movie shows just what happens out there when you have no idea what is going on. Humans will do whatever they have to just to find what has happened to whatever you are looking for (objects to people) and this movie shows just what a father would go through for his daughter. Of course, it doesn't show you how to cope with the loss of a loved one, but it does show you a lot of dad's points of view when they think about what they would go through to get their son/daughter back. Hugh Jackman shows this really well throughout the movie by showing us just how angry he can get. I would recommend this to everyone that likes the actors or likes a good story line and I hope you guys can see this first hand in the the theaters for yourself.",

It's not especially smart but there's enough suspense and grim mystery to keep your attention. I thought it picked up nicely during the vigil scene and kept my attention from then on. I liked Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Loki, and thought the eye tick and neck tattoo underscored the dysfunctional motif. There were a few clues along the way that make sense once the film reaches it's conclusion, which I guess is fun if you like figuring things out.

Original screenplay. The story is emotionally evocative on so many levels, and that's just on paper. The tremendous performances by Hugh Jackman (as the traumatized but ruthlessly steadfast father) and Jake Gyllenhaal (as the aggressively determined cop) are what makes this more than just a run-of-the-mill suspense/mystery but a powerhouse drama-thriller. The little details left to speculation regarding Gyllenhaal's character (Detective Loki) are what piques my curiosity the most, and the mutliple layers to the mysteries in the movie keep you at the edge of your seat. Maria Bello, Viola Davis, and Terrence Howard also give powerful performances of grief-stricken parents. Not an easy rewatch due to the emotions, but very rewarding given enough time between them.",

Beginning with an almost unbearably tense opening hour or so, Prisoners soon dissolves into a formulaic thriller, abandoning the near-unbearable tension of the opening hour and packing the film with foot-chases and repetitive torture-porn, finding itself too caught up in tying all the many loose ends together for it all to make sense.",

459,3 March 2017,RossRivero99,9, A near masterpiece,"Denis Villeneuve's ""Prisoners"" is not only one of the best movies of 2013 but also one of the best movies of the decade, and as well as being a very Hitchcockian type of movie. The movie stars Hugh Jackman in the best performance of his career so far as Keller Dover who in the beginning of the movie brings his wife Grace (Maria Bello), and his daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) over to their friend Franklin Birch's (Terrence Howard) house who also happens to have a wife named Nancy (Viola Davis) and they have a daughter named Eliza (Zoe Soul). As soon as the Dover's arrive at the Birch's house the two girls are doing what little kids do which is play together. Then the unthinkable happens... Both girls end up going missing under mysterious circumstances. Then later in the movie the police is called and the lead detective on the case is a policeman named Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). Then we wonder when the two girls are going to be found. With this movie Villeneuve has crafted Hitchcock like tales such as ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991), ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1950), ""Witness for the Prosecution"" (1957), and many others. Then by the time the end comes along Keller finds the woman who kidnapped the two girls who happens to be an older woman named Holly Jones (Melissa Leo). I won't spoil anything beyond this point because all of the other major moments including the ending are much too valuable to be spoiled. The acting in this movie is so good while most importantly Jackman and Gyllenhaal as the lead characters give such good performances that they were snubbed for Oscar nominations, and the supporting performances from Bello, Howard, Davis, and Leo are so good in this movie that Leo's performance is the darkest throughout this entire film. Because of this movie I can't wait to see more of Villeneuve's work such as ""Incendies"" (2010), ""Sicario"" (2015), and ""Arrival"" (2016). This was a truly great movie that shouldn't be missed by anyone that is a movie fan.",

It does have some rather protracted scenes and the various plot lines don't come together especially well.

On the other hand, if you are in the frame of mind for a whole bunch of creepy haunted house sequences and prepared to tolerate some rather nasty scenes, then you may well enjoy the way it develops. It's grey toned and slow but packs a real punch at times, with some edge of your seat moments. Not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination but a worthwhile investment of your time.

Where are the missing girls?? And will Detective Loki find them? Very suspenseful and full of action. A good film for mature audience s",
483,23 February 2014,willwri14,9, Prisoners - one of the best of 2013,"Prisoners' was a definite surprise hit. I have always enjoyed Jake Gyllenhaal's performances (Donnie Darko, The Source Code), and always respected his ability to act, alongside Hugh Jackman's excellent performance as a father who will do anything to bring back his child. I walked into 'Prisoners' with no expectations; in fact I barely knew what the movie was about. I read somewhere it was a 'Taken' clone, but that is a huge disservice to the direction, screen writing and most importantly the cinematography shown in the film. The film was so incredibly moody, falling into a similar category as 'Se7en' and 'Silence of the Lambs'. One or two scenes overstayed their welcome by a minute or so, and Jackman may be overacting to some, but I think he hit the nail on the head. Gyllenhaal also portrayed an incredibly weary and tired police officer, who becomes increasingly suspicious and twitchy as the film progresses. His performance carried the film, in my opinion. The basements were dusty and the X-Files-esque flashlights pierced the fog, while the snowy environment gave the film a cold, clinical feel. Roger Deakins has never deserved a reward for his cinematography more, and is one of my biggest inspirations in the field. The film is beautiful, while retaining a dark, sinister feel. Unfortunately, Gravity broke so many boundaries in the cinematographic field, and will likely receive more credit for 2013s cinematography. A shame, Deakins has shown his skill multiple times without any reward (outside of fame and money, obviously) in the academy and such, especially after 'Skyfall' in 2012. Outside of this, the film displays an excellent dissection of morality on a fundamental basis, and it left me thinking for a long time afterwards. The film is so pleasing to watch but oh so chilling and dark. I recommend this film to anyone, but not the faint of heart, it does get messy.",
484,5 March 2014,veronikastehr,8, Dark vision with high tension,"For quite some period of time no other thriller film gave us the opportunity to exceed the level of our expectations that much as ""Prisoners"". If we take into account the fact that the whole genre is characterized by a small share in the overall production, scarce production budgets and minimal promotion, no wonder that we rarely get more than a medium-quality generic job work. However, the Prisoners' pedigree implicitly suggested that that could yield something much more interesting. The starry cast leaded by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal together with a promising Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve and scenario writer, Aaron Guzikowski, definitively have brought some new blood in a stagnant genre.",

That passion for both love and hate convincingly oozes out of his body, and by the end, you can understand why he allows himself to be in that predicament. Jackman's toxic presence is neutralized by Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of a detective who is calm and collected for the most part, but always trying his hardest to suppress his searing disdain for most everyone around him. The supporting cast is great, well maybe minus Maria Bello with her fake crying, and the production quality is superb with the tight editing, good flow and buildup to suspense. All of these outstanding elements in this movie enable me to overlook some pet peeves, specifically the contrived moments used to push the plot along, and there are quite a few.",

These are all actors I was never particular fond of either, especially in relation to Jake Gyllenhaal. His character in this film had depth though and left you with certain curiosity. You know there's a back story there with all the clues and emphasis on behavior, mannerisms, and appearance in general. Also actress Melissa Leo, known for her riveting performances in Frozen River and The Fighter, totally engrosses herself in her respective character in which she worked very hard to make herself appear older and worn. This story allows you to solve the puzzle at the same speed as it's characters while asking yourself the same questions. Although both the film's writer Aaron Guzikowski and its Canadian Director Denis Villeneuve are virtually unknowns in Hollywood, their pairing with legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins made this a beautifully shot film as well. The images of weather and landscape are as cold, dark, dreary, and depressing as the film itself which makes it all the more chilling. - Reviewed by AN/NR 09-20-2013",

The mystery keeps the plot interesting and thrilling even when the movie reaches the end, with the twists that keep coming eventually piece the puzzle together.

While the premise may sound like something out of the Taken franchise, the films could not be more different. Prisoners is bleak, nihilistic and grounded in reality. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal give shocking performances as the two people leading the search for the girls with the pressure and the anxiety of their task seeping through their performances. Denis Villeneuve combines his talents as a director with the greatest cinematographer of all time Roger Deakins to create beautiful yet haunting shots throughout the film. The imagery is powerful and combined with the distressing story it can lead to some truly shocking moments with a moment in particular when a revelation about the girls is discovered gives me shivers every time I watch it. The score pounds, the colors turn grey and the fear and trauma of the characters can be felt and it's as if out of a horror movie. Not to even mention the incredible final act. The film is well paced and wastes no time from its two and a half hour run time making every second of the film count in the search for the girls. Prisoners is not for the lighthearted and can be quite distressing for even the most hardened viewer but it is a remarkable and haunting film that will leave you thinking after the credits roll.",

This film has stuck with me for a while now--it has a presence about it that crawls underneath your skin. It deals with very adult themes and can, at times, be tough to view, but it is an important film that allows us to witness how some individuals handle adversity and frustration. Many of the critic reviews acknowledge the work by Jackman, but it is the work by Gyllenhaal that really wowed me.

We can start with the casting of actors in which the performance of Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki is marvelous and finishing with an extraordinary Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, father of one of the kidnapped girls. I feel that I'm in debt with this character because it is one of the best acting I've ever seen on the big screen. His desperation for finding his daughter is so real that you will feel the tension during the whole film. According to what I've read Hugh Jackman even spent several nights without sleeping in order to make that impression during the shooting of the film. On the other hand, the plot cannot be more interesting and intriguing so you will see yourself trying to figure out who is the responsible of the disappearance of the little girls. Despite kidnapping of kids in Hollywood movies are pretty common, the production and direction of Prisoners is completely different. I don't usually give points easily on this website but I will do an exception with this one because I ended up totally impressed and open-mouthed. I gave nine points without any kind of hesitation. I'm looking forward to watching the next part of Prisoners because the ending of the film lead to believe that there will be a second part. I strongly recommend you to watch it.

It's all too common to see these aloof sullen detectives suck the life out of a movie with excessive dreariness but Gyllenhaal gets the balance between sombre and compassionate just right. Sadly though, the writing is a bit of a letdown and we are left with numerous unanswered questions and directionless subplots. To be honest, I'm still not quite sure what actually happened and how events unfolded. Everything felt a bit sloppy and incomplete, not to mention the film ran way too long.

The films tempo is also nicely applied, applied correctly so that throughout each scene, you become interested and curious as to what may happen. Much of the storytelling is done in a stripped back style, a muck more basic ground of storytelling but an elegance that makes it so fulfilling and worth much more than that. If ever you've played the game The Last of Us, then you''ll understand what I am trying to explain. Overall I highly praise this film for being such a great watch, but also the feelings I was given whilst watching this movie, such as; suspense, intimidation and the thoughts of each scene I still have after reaching the conclusion of this film.

I've always liked writing reviews for movies, and i've always loved writing on IMDb, until recently. For some reason, I don't seem to agree with most of the reviews and ratings for many movies, but it's perfectly subjective whether a movie is good or not. Anyway, prisoners is not so bad. This movie has so much potential, especially with all the great actors in the movie. Unfortunately, the supposed to be great story line fell of short due to the darn long duration and not so convincing acting of the actors. First thing first, what's good about the movie. There are so many famous and talented actors in this movie. The idea of the story is actually quite good, it's a typical kidnap story but its not quite predictable. Now the bad thing about this movie. The story line is thrilling, but only during the first 30 minutes of the movie. Then the movie just drags the story all the way for almost 3 hours and didn't achieve much. Hell, even after i waited for 2 and a half hours , i still never got my ending. The movie didn't have an ending. It was an open ending, where the director doesn't give any closure to the story, leaving the audience to think and imagine for themselves whats going to happen next. The bunch of famous actors who are supposed to be talented were for some reason not talented at all in this movie. Their acting was terrible! No one was convincing whatsoever. Its like they didn't even bother trying. I'm so disappointed for many reasons. 1, the thriller was nice. 2, Hugh Jackman and a few other famous actors are in the movie. 3, the reviews are all so good. 4, thriller is my favorite movie genre and this movie was not that thrilling, on a scale of 1-10 the thrilling factor is maybe 3, and it was at the beginning of the movie when the children got kidnapped, oh and during the beat up session where the guy's face was shown all bloody and bloated. Overall, this movie deserves a 4/10.",
542,25 December 2013,fabkingcliff,10, The finest crime drama flick I have seen in as long as I can remember.,What do you say after watching a movie like Prisoners? What words can describe the intense emotional crisis it instills in you? The moral dilemma it puts you in? The only thing one can blame this movie for is the psychological impact it will have on the viewer while and after watching it. Everything worked perfectly to bring 'Prisoners' to life.,

I felt the characterisation could be better, the interactions were all pretty bleak after the feel good intro (if you've seen Twin Peaks, you'll know what I'm getting at, but it is a movie and not a show, so they had less time and I suppose didn't want to confuse the mood).",

Man, he played the role as a detective so much you know, stunning. Movie is full of suspense and drama and Hugh Jackman also did very well in this movie, can't wait for the sequel of this movie.",

549,23 September 2013,axfan64,9," Prisoners: A dark, disturbing, and twisted film","Prisoners is definitely by far one of the best crime thrillers of our generation. It is a very dark environment this film takes place in and the atmosphere is one that is cold and shocking. It attacks your core on a personal level by trying to put you in the characters' shoes, would you have done what Keller(Hugh Jackman) did to try and find his daughter, is one of the huge questions director Denis Villeneuve tries to emphasize on you and throughout you contemplate whether or not it was, which is what really got me on this film. The acting by the two leads is superb, by far my favorite Hugh Jackman role, and Jake Gyllenhaal plays the role like he has done it many times. I must say that the rest of the characters didn't really place their importance in this film besides Paul Dano, and I didn't want it to end the way it did. All in all this film was really enjoyable to watch, I'd suggest going to see this in theaters.",

I am sure everyone who watched it was like, it is too long and it could have been done in 90 minutes or so, but to me... I found that the puzzles in the film and the hidden parts that we don't see are amazingly delivered to us and in the end I felt like the movie did not show me what i need to see but I know what happened and it made me feel awesome. The plot and the twists in the movie are impressive, and the fair ending was satisfying. Jackman and Gylenhaal were just perfect for the film, Melissa Leo as always was very impressive... I wanted to see more of Bello's appearances in the movie, but she was OK too... and Terrance Howard and Viola Davis were such a perfect and real match. Paul Dano as always, stands out and he was great. The movie is Oscar movie so if at least one of the actors should be nominated. I loved the movie a lot and the whole mood of it... I personally missed to see such things on the screen.",

552,12 November 2013,pablo2896,10," Dat script, dat acting, dat directing","As you saw in my title the script in this movie takes the main spotlight. The twists and turns, the dialogues and the right 'till the end top level suspense. All of those aspects are majorly improved by the amazing man sitting in the directors chair and the talented men acting it out in front of the camera. Especially the one and only Hugh Jackman who steals every single scene he is in. That doesn't by far mean the other actors aren't that good. Gyllenhaal and Terrence Howard both portray two desperate men perfectly. Now to the plot which puts you in this awful situation on which two girls get abducted. A detective (Gyllenhaal) is put in charge of the case while the father of one of the girls (Jackman) takes some extreme measures. I won't go further than that to not spoil you of anything awesome (which by the way tends to be the whole movie). Directing-wise this movie is just out there in space. By I literally don't remember looking away or blinking. I just sat there at the edge of my seat biting my fingers! The composition of the opening shot just gave me the chills. A still shot of some creepy snowy woods with a dear walking by, while Jackman spells out ""The holy father"" is beautifully unsettling. A lot of the shots are still shots. They don't shy away of lingering the shots. Props to that dude named Denis Villeneuve. I'll throw it out there that this movie made me cringe. It is disturbing **** The last thing I wanna point out is the ending. It has you on your knees by being a very quiet but intense scene full of some sweet sweet shots. In the end this movie tackled all of the aspects that make a thriller great and it will definitely get itself some of those Oscar noms! 10 out of 10 baby!",
553,4 September 2021,Luisvtw,10, A thought provoking film,"After a long time I finally watched it, I have always heard so many good things about it before and I can only say that all the good reviews are deserved. Prisoners is a very dark and sad film in which people are on the verge of despair and shows how quickly life can change. The cast is really terrific Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are for me the core in this film. The running time of 153 minutes may be a little too long for some, but I personally found that the time passed very quickly because spend a lot of time thinking about every scene. In the end I can say that this movie is definitely worth watching.",

I don't know whether to suggest you stay clear of this film and avoid at all cost, or whether to recommend it. Prisoners has really almost redefined the Thriller genre and in a sense, set the bar so high for upcoming Thrillers, its gonna take a master piece to get your heart racing even half as fast as this one does. ""The Equalizer"" doesn't even come close to equalizing with this high ranker.",

Suspenseful and unpredictable.,

Most noticeable was Hugh Jackman's intense role of a caring father who was ready to push beyond the limits for his family.

558,29 November 2014,Rickting,9, One of the scariest thrillers I've seen in a while,"Prisoners may not contain jump scares, ghosts, screaming, things that go bump in the night or loads of fog but it is one of the scariest movies of 2013. This terrifying child abduction thriller is unbelievably chilling and once it has viewers in its raw, icy grip it never lets go. Hugh Jackman and Terence Howard are the 2 fathers whose daughters go missing and Jake Gyllenhaal's detective tries to find them. Both the fathers go to extreme lengths to find their children. The film goes into a lot of dark territory, and it has some very disturbing scenes. But it is genuinely, completely and undeniably brilliant. It's 2 and a half hour length was unnecessary and there are scenes which weren't needed. This doesn't blunt the film's impact overall though. The acting and cinematography make the movie. Roger Deakin's amazing cinematography and Denis Villeneuve's tense direction mean the film both looks amazing and is absolutely filled with dread. If you want to be on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours watch this. Trust me, you will be.",

This movie is horrifying, but you just can't look away. The performances in this movie are deserving of oscars themselves. Hugh Jackson will shock you with his enthusiasm for this role and his dedications. The music is good and the editing is also very good. If you want to use your time wisely and watch a movie that you will be thinking of for a long time after viewing, then prisoners is the perfect movie.",

I really felt like I was there with the families going through everything they were going through. I felt their pain. I thought I knew what was going to happen and then something else happens and I am drawn into the movie just waiting to see what happens next. I kept thinking what if this was my family?

It's a good kidnapped story, however I must say that I'm quite depressed after watched this movie. Perhaps,it's too emotional and gripping. Around 20 minutes before the movie finished,I can guess the kidnapper and here you can expect a twist and clever ending. I am impressed with Hugh's acting since I only saw him as an action hero like in X-Men or Wolverine.I do hope to see him in more drama movies. If you want a simple thriller movie, then be brace because it can be too emotional for you.I also love Melissa Leo's and Paul Dano's acting.",
562,5 January 2014,normanemailer,5, inconclusive and frustrating,"I watched this movie with no preconceived thoughts or knowledge about it. As it progressed I felt an increasing sense of being manipulated by the script and plot. The acting is okay, lots of mannerisms, especially from Gillenhall but he's a strong character actor and can pull it off. But the movie is full of unexplained moments and weak linking. The main characters do things without any apparent motivation. Red herrings are presented and then vanish without any explanation. The storyline is full of holes. The immorality of Jackman's character's behavior is a deep concern and this is then swept away by his being incarcerated and lost to his family without any relation to the ending. It's a frustrating film because it had the potential to be so much better but the inconclusive ending and dismissive resolution leaves one feeling cheated after sitting though two and a half hours of a very slowly built tension. The script should have been heavily edited before it went into production. I don't understand why the two lead actors agreed to make this movie. Neither of them can be short of job offers.",
563,22 November 2013,yuvalbianco,6, Could easily fit into 90 minutes,"I usually agree with IMDb's ratings but unfortunately not this time, This movie was mediocre at best and really nothing we haven't seen before, A lot of Clichés and suspense tricks we've already seen in other movies of this type, I could not really relate to the characters and felt that the dialogs were corny and that I have already seen them on other movies. I could have given it a 7 but it was way way way too long, Could have easily fit into 90 minutes instead of 153 !!! To tell the truth I fast forwarded at least 30 minutes of the movie because I just got bored. The acting and plot were believable for the first hour but after that it got too much for me to even care, This is really NOT the masterpiece everybody here are talking about.",
564,6 September 2018,willcarter-56155,7, A future masterpiece classic for sure.,"Denis Villeneuve didn't debut with Prisoners, but it was this movie that put him on the map as one of the most exciting new talents to come around in sometime. Prisoners is about a pair of girls who are abducted which leads to an investigation and search effort by the father of one girl played superbly by Hugh Jackman. This is a tough but rewarding film to sit through and the pacing is good- you will be transfixed throughout. The acting is superb and everyone from Terence Howard and Jake Gyllenhaal to Paul Dano and Melissa Holly shine, but the star act is Jackman who should have received more accolades for his turn as the distraught father in this movie. Cinematography is stunning as is the direction.",

Anyway back my my real point/question... ",
567,20 September 2013,acecomicscollect,4, Prisoners not worth it,"Well acted but mediocre script & a major letdown. The commercials really had me sold. Normally I'm not fooled by commercials, I must admit, this time I was fooled. I won't give the ending away, let's just say you won't be happy & this will be a one & done movie. My advice is to skip it or wait for it on Netflix or Red Box. I knew less than half way through the movie what was coming & whodunit. Unfortunately, this is a movie that Hollywood just couldn't keep their not so subtle liberal, leftist politics out of. This is set up in the very 1st scene where Hugh Jackman is out with his son shooting a poor Bambi like deer & again later when you see all the ""I'm ready for anything"" supplies in Hugh's basement. Hugh's character ends up pulling a totally foolish act that no logical, ""I'm ready for anything"" right winger would ever do. I don't think any liberal capable of thought would have done what Hugh ends up doing either. No, I'm not talking about torturing the young man. The resolution to that even turns out liberal. Torture doesn't ------. You figure it out. Message of this flick is ""sit on your hands & be a helpless glob while the brilliant, benevolent government & their employees will take care of it all for you"". Puck!",

I won't waste your time telling you about how brilliant the soon-to-be Oscar nominees and winners were, acting was superb. With a cast like this I take it for granted. The director should get some praises, please endorse him.

Hugh Jackman does a magnificent job as a desperate father who knows no boundaries, when it comes to finding his missing daughter.

The story is centred around the disappearance of Keller's daughter..the way things changed in the movie is good, you never know what's gonna come next. huge Jackman was very keen to find his missing daughter and he thinks that police is not doing enough.. I personally liked the detective's character. The mysterious Alex Jones(Paul Dano)and also the Runner makes things more complicated.

By the end of the film I was hoping a meteor would fly out of the sky, hit the town and blow up the entire place! Two and a half hours and $6.99 (Amazon.com) gone from my life!

I was thrilled all the way and still, plot holes are the kind of ones that get you screaming at the screen and make you hate the film the more you talk about it, not to mention the underwhelming climax. By the way, I figured out what was going on after half an hour, and I usually suck at that. This is a perfect proof of that old saying, no one can make a good movie out of a poor script.

The film entrenches viewers in a maze of hazy moral boundaries and pushes the limits of desperation in its characters, made up by an all-star line-up of accomplished actors.

And they could have explained better why the little girl said the main dad was there putting tape over her mouth.

It was good enough to keep me awake from start to the end, not only because of the intense, bloody and suspenseful scenes, but also because the movie made it really hard for the audience to predict the truth about the abduction of the kids. There are of course heartbreaks and shocks throughout this movie, I totally recommend this for parents and people that likes mystery and thriller movies.

Bad bad bad, too much time span to deliver such a useless and unbearable story line. I hate it to my guts.

The acting is superb, but the story just wrings your heart and makes you feel angry and helpless. Denis Villeneuve does an admirable job of creating a sense of dread without completely diminishing hope. This is a very compelling drama, however it's not a viewing experience I'd like to repeat anytime soon.",

I seldom put spoilers in reviews but this film is complex and I must bring up the turn of events. As far as acting goes this is Jake Gyllenhaal's film.

Maybe the dramatic overload of a developing kidnapping is the great hook for sustain the tension and interest for so much time. However I think the performances, the unexpected, help. I think an interesting thing is the way the characters acquire and manage information. The dosage of information seems carefully designed. The detective, the captain, the reaction of Mr Dover, etc, are far from clichés. I've experienced how the characters were confused and desperate like me, and that was possible (I think) thanks to the way the movie deliver information. No geniuses unveiling facts, characters are like people, they have hits and misses, very realistic. I liked the movie",

You know what I think...PAYDAY.
Jake G starts at 11+ and never waivers. His painfully predictable performance is ""Zodiac lite"".
Hugh Jackman seemed to decide each day on set who he was ""going to be"" that day.

A psychologically harrowing and almost disturbing story that takes advantage of the balanced and well played actors performance. A special mention to the stunning symmetrical evolution of the main actors characters played by Jackman and Gyllenhaal. The director gives us the free choice to pick up our character side, which evolves with the complexity of the situations. This leads to a constant questioning about the right and bad way to solve the case. I just regret that the intrigue lacks a bit of pace. Overall a great movie in the pure line of 'mystic river' and 'Zodiac'.",

611,19 September 2020,adeckofcards,9, A suffocating thriller,"Denis Villeneuve has an innate talent for creating such an immersive atmosphere in his films that it is impossible to take your eyes off the screen.
With 'Prisoners' he approaches the criminal and police thriller with a labyrinth of emotions and intrigues as well constructed as it is compelling and suffocating. It is prodigious of this author how he creates tension and even terror with planes as simple as the depth approach to the trunk of a tree, and even more, he manages to maintain this same tension and feeling of restlessness at a level that is only comparable with David Fincher. And it is that really, this film could be a Fincher film like 'Zodiac' or 'Seven', but Villeneuve gives it his own stamp that, slowly but surely, becomes a very recognizable one and catapults him as one of the best of their generation.
'Prisoners' is a captivating criminal maze, it is true that it has flaws and at one point it becomes more complex than necessary, but it is still one of the best and most suffocating thrillers of recent years.",

Before you watch this film you should know that it isn't an easy watch, it is probably the most realistic depiction of an abduction ever and at two and a half hours long it is not an easy watch, don't be expecting too sail through it like you might when watching the wolf of wall street, it is worth watching and savouring every second of. The characters are developed brilliantly and you feel a strong amount of empathy for pretty much all of the characters and have sympathy for the situation they are in. The film also has a very unapologetic tone, there is one aspect of the film which may even verge on disturbing but this only adds to the plot and character development. Have I mentioned already about how beautiful this film is, it feels like you are watching the work of someone who sat developing the set for each scene for days on end, the film also includes a one minute sequence which is one of the most beautiful set pieces ever, easily up there with the cola cabana steady cam in Goodfellas and the steady cam behind the trike in The Shining.

This film is not a family friendly one as the lengths that Hugh Jackman will go to to find his daughter are disturbing at best. The small town feel is very well demonstrated and the set design is authentic. David Dastmalchian is persuasive as the wannabe serial killer. The scene with the snakes is creepy and interesting. One small issue is the beginning of the film can be a bit of a drag because the detective doesn't talk much and he pauses a lot.

The acting performances are very extreme which befits the central dilemma of the film, asking what is justified when children's lives are hanging in the balance and what kind of demons are lurking in us all.

635,6 December 2013,zeusandtomshow,7, Prisoners will captivate you!,"Prisoners is a tense mystery-thriller that will spin you through fits of fear, repulsion, anger, and relief. We highly recommend it based on its overall enjoyability as a movie that provides expected chills along with personal moral questions when you put yourself into the hero's shoes. The beginning of the movie has a palpable sense that something bad is about to happen. It's a similar feeling that you get at the beginning of many horror movies where the characters are introduced as carefree friends through the use of pointless, mundane chatter and laughter. But once the girls disappear, it's on! Any of you who are parents, as we are, can instantly relate to that lightning strike of fear that shoots through you when you realize you don't know where you kid is. That tenseness remains with you through most of the movie as they try to unravel the circumstances around the disappearance. Jake Gyllenhaal does an adequate job as the plodding yet persistent investigator, Detective Loki. The audience will be put into a balancing act of rooting for Loki to find the abductor, and hating Loki for not laying down the law while we sympathize with the victim's father Keller Dover, played convincingly by Hugh Jackman. It's really the character of Dover that will have the audience gut-wrenched as they try to decide if they would take the law into their own hands as Dover does when, as often happens, the law lets the accused out of jail. While Loki partially redeems himself by finally getting tough with the suspects and finding his way to the abductor, he still loses points for allowing one suspect to commit suicide before he can get an answer out of him and allowing Dover to beat him to the crime scene. The Dover character lets us down by torturing the wrong suspect and by letting himself be captured at the end. So, neither main character fully rewards the audience. But the biggest letdown was the revelation of the old church lady that broke bad and started killing kids after losing her own son many years prior. It was an, ""Uh, really?"" moment for the audience. But despite these few flaws, the movie manages to hold the audience captive and deliver the punches expected of a knockout thriller. See it!",

640,24 December 2021,tmbiro,10, A hidden gem that will stay with you long after the credits roll.,"Considering Denis Villeneuve is a somewhat popular director with wide release blockbusters like Arrival, Blade Runner 2049 and most recently Dune, it is a crime that more people don't talk about possibly the greatest psychological thriller ever made, Prisoners. Prisoners is a movie about two girls that go missing and follows Jake Gyllenhaal, a detective who is tasked with tracking down the girls and Hugh Jackman, the father of one of the girls with a ""Pray for the best, prepare for the worst"" attitude. The two leads are exceptional as well as most of the supporting actors, specifically Paul Dano. Roger Deakins also killed it as the cinematographer. While it isn't as flashy as his other movies like 1917 or Blade Runner, each shot is rich with character and really makes you feel the hopelessness the leads feel. The last thing I want to rant about is the dialogue. While this film is nearly 2.5 hours long and contains very limited action, it never felt boring to me and is one of those movies where I get excited when two character talk to eachother because the script is so riveting. I cannot recommend this movie enough. While it can be depressing at times, give it a shot. The movie just flies by and if it was longer, I would not be opposed. 10/10.",

There is one shot in which the camera just focuses on a tree which was exceptional. Yeah, just a tree. But it conveys great mood and atmosphere. The ending will leave you satisfied.

Prisoners is thought-provoking and really makes people question their moral boundaries. How far would you go realistically? But what drove Prisoners home, was its honesty. It refused to go the easy route also known as Hollywood. The first half is a slow and steady build-up that adds the realism of the situation. The second half is mystery heavy and unbelievably interesting. A film has not been this involving in a long time, especially with the mystery genre. Denis Villeneuve completely breaks- out and is for sure a director to keep an eye on. Also the most beautiful cinematography of the year. (Gravity had great cinematography, but with Earth as a background a lot, it is almost unfair) It is my favorite cinematography because Roger Deakins was able to use such simple and plain locations and used them perfectly, composing impeccable imagery.

This movies is filled with interesting ideas that have to brushed aside in service of a plot which would not be out of place in your average Law & Order episode. The film has a strange religious subtext that is both underdeveloped and overwrought. I could see half of the plot twists coming and in the third act the film basically became a Law & Order episode with an overly simple resolution and ""ambiguous"" ending. The real problem here is the script. It does have some interesting ideas like the quirks of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal's characters, but these and others have almost no development beyond the one or two scenes that feature them. If the director had been allowed to rewrite the script the film would have been a lot better and likely have the same impact as the director's previous film. That being said the film is still a well-acted, well- filmed, and intermittently well-written thriller that is extremely emotionally effective and occasionally disturbing.",
652,2 March 2021,gedikreverdi,7, Religion creates vengeful people,"The characters are annoying in general so it was very hard to root for any of them even if their little daughters have been kidnapped. The Birch family was almost nonexistent throughout the movie. The entire film revolved around Keller and the detective both of who wasn't very likable characters as one of them was very bad at his job and the other tortured a mentally challenged victim throughout the whole film. The maze man that ran away from the detective at the candlelight vigil and then shot himself in the head at the police station under custody? Was he a relative of the couple that lost their kids and took revenge on god by kidnapping other people's kids? And how were snakes relevant? They found snakes in locked containers in the maze guy's house too. The best detail of the movie was the father killed a man that confessed him about killing kids. The detective found the body of the man coincidentally in the basement of the father and it was the husband of the woman who was shot dead by he detective while administering something to the Kellers daughter. Before that she forced Keller with gun to go down in the hole under the old car in the garden. He found the whistle down there and the detective heard the whistle standing in the garden all alone after forensic team went away. The plot was good but I hate when American movies try too hard to have an extremely happy and desired ending as if they want to not make anyone leave the theater upset. Besides, the details about the kidnapped families fascination with snakes and mazes weren't clear. It was hard watching the mentally challenged being tortured and he was also kidnapped by the couple and he wasn't related to them at all but in the end he reunited with his family long time after like the girls.",

654,12 May 2017,piku1302,10, Best Thriller by far,"Personally it has to be a really great movie,without some goofs that a viewer can see or a non sense in a film that most people even don't recognize,to give me goosebumps and ""suck"" me me in the story.-All that fulfills this film and my high criteria ranking!Prisoners totally surprised me with it's great atmosphere which is very very hard to achieve in movies like this.At first I thought,,oh again a boring movie where two children get lost/kidnapped where I already know the story line for sure! But! Boom- the so atmosphere in the film is made so great&suspense at the same time like watching a horror movie where I can't wait what will happen in the next corner,an eye look,a sound or after the next scene.All credits to the director and of course the cast,where I need to say that Jake Gyllenhaal performance in this film is the greatest of all time !Why? Because he developed and is experienced method and character actor,who have described the difference along the lines that they are not playing a character, but inhabiting one. The lines they speak are not because that is whats written in the script, it's actually what the character, with their story and background and experience, would actually say.I firmly believe that such actors are The Best ones,Hollywood as such has not many..let's say about 8-10,but one such promising Actor will soon join them.Jake Gyllenhall of course is the one I'm talking about.But... That's just my opinion.We can also see that he is growing and improving as an Actor,plus he can play very different roles,his capabilities as an actor is magnificent.He is young,at the beginning but his beginning and what an Actor he is had only a few ones in Hollywood,who are today Top class Actors... and where Directors and Producers are fighting between themselves about in which Blockbuster Movie they will play the lead character. :) ",

656,12 August 2021,Abdulxoxo,8," A compelling, dark psychological thriller","First and easily the most noticeable is the plot. There is so much detail behind this storyline that you really have to pay attention if you want to enjoy it. Yet so many pieces of this complex puzzle are just out of your reach so that you never know what to expect or when to expect it. And there's more than one twist. In fact, there are more surprises then you can count. This helps the movie grab your attention without a moment of letting it go. Another thing that sticks out is the acting. Hugh Jackman's performance stands as a landmark in his career as an actor. He plays a father who is in search of his missing daughter and will go at any lengths to find her. The emotion in his eyes and voice carries from the screen to the audience because we can relate so well to the film. Jake Gyllenhaal also gave an outstanding performance as detective Loki. One other thing that caught my eye was the incredible cinematography and musical score. There is something about the filming technique that really gets under your skin. It allows the audience to see what the actors can't see anticipating what may or may not happen.",

Fine, it doesn't have to be a happy ending, but give us SOMETHING :D we just wanna know how it finishes for God's sake.

Prisoners, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) and written by Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband), is a suspenseful thriller that leaves the viewer thinking this could happen to them. Prisoners follows two families and the kidnapping of their children. The film's dialogue develops each character differently, driving some mad while leaving others feeling helpless. As the story line develops it shows the range of everyone's emotions during this situation. Along with detective Loki, the two families must hold on to their sanity and their hope as all hope is constantly lost in the discovery of who has taken their children. ",

A powerful drama thriller ! This one gonna stay inside for long. This has to be the best performance of High Jackman . He portrays his character so well with layers of Emotion of a father who is in anguish and grief yet raging to go to any extent to know the truth of what happened to his daughter is incredibly well done . Jake Gyllenhaal is incredible as always ! The cinematography is just brilliant . The only problem of the film is that it is a tad too long and maybe problematic for certain people who loves fast paced thriller but the slow and steady suspense unfolding makes it very gripping .., and with years gone by and this film still tops many list I assume people didn't had that problem.. Also the maze part didn't seem to fit well enough in the narrative at times. Surely this is one of the finest thrillers to come out backed by outstanding performances ,gritty storytelling and will surely revisit this in upcoming years !!! Denis Villeneuve you are awesome !!",

Prisoners delivers a mix of predictable suspense with some elements of surprise, like the ending. The movie entangles you in an emotional roller-coaster then stops prematurely. I loved the movie, but left feeling twisted & robbed. The cast was superb and the story unraveled nicely but collapsed hard on you at the end. Its a terrible feeling that the director puts you through and I hate him for that. I would wait for the DVD and hopefully he will fix the ending on a special extended directors cut edition then you will have the ending this movie deserves. It is just not complete, why start something if you are not going to complete it? Its like an incomplete sentence you get from a loved one on their death bed.

At least 45 minutes too long considering you can figure out the end after thirty. Tag line for this film should have been ""World's stupidest father meets worlds slowest detective."" Moves at a snails pace with manufactured twists and not a single character resembles a real human being. Perhaps it would have worked better if the casting of the families had been reversed. It seemed like the director was trying so hard to turn Hugh Hackman into Liam Nelson in Taken. Very little real suspense.

Good acting and some tense moments, but all in all a convoluted plot full of holes and unfathomable motivations. The big reveal at the end is ridiculous. So is the use of the alcoholic priest as a murderer based on what some guy said in confession. If the priest so easily told police what the guy said after he killed him, why not just go to the police in the first place? The torture is overdone. The supposed religious undertones are ludicrous as supposed motivation. Jake Gyllendhal is great. The others are fine. The plot is stupid.",

687,21 September 2013,drpakmanrains,6, Overlong Hokey Climax Spoils Well Acted Thriller Somewhat,"As usual, as I scan the reviews here, they tend to be either highly laudatory, or scathingly awful. I really wanted to like this film, as I love thrillers, but this one failed to satisfy me ultimately. The set up of the two girls disappearing and the realization they have been taken was excellent, and the lead performances were all believable and very intense. However, without divulging the specific revelations in the final hour, for me they seemed very far fetched, and the action scenes, especially the car-chase scene, so far over the top and excessive that they bordered on hokey. Still, the film overall is not bad, but at over two and a half hours, it left me feeling disappointed, and could have been about 30 minutes shorter. I had some questions about certain parts, but it is one of those films I wouldn't want to see again, as there are almost no moments to actually enjoy. I loved ""The Butler"", and ""Instructions Not Included"", but can only marginally recommend ""Prisoners"" due to its unrelenting grimness and length.",

This is a nice example of how actors can do multiple sequels and still do other movies without having its image imprinted to one type of movie. Hugh Jackman is able to go beyond his Volverine image and do a great job in this movie. I've never been a big fan of Jake Gyllenhal, but he really did a superb acting on this piece.

Cartoonish might be the word we're it no for the incredibly troubling, violent acts at the heart of this film. Mostly very well shot but nothing again to save a film that very early on seems determined to go after the big shocks and too obvious horrors for the reviewer to really care, apart from the regular repulsion factor.

It requires the viewers to invest themselves emotionally, and will often keep the viewer on the edge of their seats throughout it's many twists and turns. Prisoners is tedious at times because of it's slow unravelling nature, however this is used to draw the viewer in and join in this thriller. More films like this need to be made and it's a shame that Hollywood won't touch this subject matter more often. Prisoners is quite a dark and disturbing story.

It's really a shame this wasn't nominated for more Academy Awards, because Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, and even Paul Dano were more than worthy of at least being nominated for their performances. Viola Davis was great as well (not that we'd expect any less from such a brilliant actress) though her role was somewhat small.

Okay, this movie starts out good enough, good actors etc. but it spends a lot of time going to a whole lot of nowhere! Some of my complaints, the cop broke as many laws and committed more civil rights violations than anyone in the movie. Also, the cop's part has been seen in a million other movies. The only difference is in my opinion this cop is an idiot! Now the dad, Hugh Jackman, of course he's a great actor and does not disappoint in this movie, but his part was way over the top and he was Einstein compared to the cop, Jake Gyllenhaal. The entire movies was actually about these two and everybody else were just there! My wife's complaint, was mainly everyone spoke to quietly, so it was hard to hear and easy to miss things. Then to cap it all off... there is no real ending, it's just over, period. That's it, just over!!!",

He has a gun, but decides to keep it in his toolbox. The police are senseless idiots who know nothing much about forensic or detective skills. They are happy to let a person positively identified as a suspect let be as soon as his aunt bails him out. A pathetic painful arse of a movie. Likely so for any of you who have an ounce of wisdom.",

It's that kind of movie, supremely intriguing and gripping till the last second. These actors must have gone through some true mental anguish (particularly Hugh Jackman and Paul Dano). The darkest depths of human emotions are explored as a worst-case ""what would you do if it were your family"" scenario comes to life. For me, it also called to mind studies on human behavior, in which groups or mobs of humans are proved to be capable of things that go against--in theory--their beliefs or values.

Be forewarned this movie contains scenes of brutal violence that should leave you wincing.Gyllenhaal's logical and professional Detective Loki provides an excellent foil for the irrational and illogical behaviour that comes to pass around him as he struggles to solve a missing persons case. And even as he succeeds, those with blind right wing views continue to support their own evil actions through various means including religion. Blindly they cling to their original views with twisted logic and a refusal to accept facts. Inside a situation where bad actions are compounded by more bad actions, Villeneuve also explores the depths and importance of a person's own children. In particular Villeneuve seems interested in how much of a person's life fulfilment is linked to their children's lives. Throughout the film the childless Detective Loki's history and life is never really filled in. Brilliantly though, he is still engaging to the audience, and the subject of children as always increases our emotional involvement. The atmosphere is taut in this film, and punctuated by violence that is made all the more brutal by that tautness. The full 2 1/2 hours is required to follow such a complex descent into people's emotions and the illogical and prejudiced acts that follow when a child's life may be threatened. The plot is as twisting and unpredictable as people's emotions can be, and you may be surprised by the ending.",

What could you be capable of doing to ensure the safety of your loved ones? Prisoners is a film that pushes the boundaries of moralistic values, it crosses a line that we hope to never have to cross in a situation we pray we never have to be in. Keller Dover played by Hugh Jackman (Wolverine, Les Misérables) and his wife Grace played by Maria Bello(Payback, The Secret Window) attend a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their neighbours Franklin played by Terrence Howard (Iron Man, Hustle & Flow) and Nancy Birch played by Viola Davis (How to get away with murder, The Help). Their 2 young daughters, Anna and Joy go outside to play but never return. An investigation is launched with Detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal (Nightcrawler, Brokeback Mountain)arresting the prime suspect being a young man with the IQ of a ten year old whose RV was spotted where the young girls were last seen. As time drags on and the girls remain missing slowly desperation sets in and Keller decides to take matters into his own hands. Once again I want to say so much about the plot but if I do I'd be breaking my own rules and giving away so much. The plot is so interesting, I loved it, I loved the way the story in its entirety was played out, and I loved the characters and how well they were played. Hugh Jackman proves once again why he is so sought after in the film industry he was so convincing as the desperate father I'm surprised there was no Oscar buzz about his performance. Not only Hugh though, his fellow cast members were just as engaging and hypnotic. A perfect cast in my opinion. Jake Gyllenhaal (who did win Best Supporting Actor of the Year Award at the 2013 Hollywood Film Festival) was mesmerising with his character as well. The other stand out feature for me though was the cinematography it was amazing and really feel it helped the story teller tell his amazing tale; once again I was extremely impressed by the visuals. I don't really know the director Denis Villeneuve's other works but I can tell he is a man of talent and I'll be looking him up to see what else he has done. Prisoners will leave you feeling desperate and curious, running at a little under 3hrs it does take its toll as well, I'm not sure it really needed to be that long but for the outcome it does work and you hardly notice the time. The film is very disturbing in nature, has some very graphic scenes so not one for the kids.

The characters are believable, and the dialogue is not false or clunky. But keep in mind that every detail matters in this film.

I enjoyed the first two hours of this movie immensely. But then... towards the end, my wife and I both coincidentally realized: 1) This was a very long movie, and some scenes didn't need to be there, while, 2) the movie skipped past some things it could have explored a bit more 3) I felt the ending left us hanging. It was a bit like a recent Steven King novel... enjoyable as hell but then the loose ends just sort of flop away at the end and leave it to you to work out in your own head. The moral of this story is very unclear. Yet... paradoxically... that's also what I like about this movie. It makes me think about justice, and what can happen when we take it into our own hands. Things that seem so clear can be so murky. The major twist at the end of this movie could have been handled better (the connection between the missing boy and the presumed kidnapper of the girls)- it was almost an afterthought. My other complaint was the bizarre way the movie DROPPED the scene where Gyllenhaal discovers Jackman torturing the boy... WHY was this scene CUT, then Jackman is free, but then... arggg. Just a frustrating ending. I half respect that, but half of me feels it was manipulative and poorly handled. This is a hard movie to review.

Jake Gyllenhaal's character was well-played charismatic and compelling to watch. The problems began when plot twist seem to be written in for the sake of shock value, and we're not believable. The motive of the abductions and or killings was so convoluted it seemed silly, and all the psychological tension that had been built up was lost the more motive was revealed.
I found the depiction of mental illness in one of the victims, Bob, insulting and unrealistic, and utterly cliched.

Prisoners is such an incredibly made movie; each shot is diligently crafted, each piece of dialogue is captivating and dramatic. The atmosphere is very dark, gloomy, and creepy. It is almost like that of a horror movie. For example, the use of differed weather is used in may scenes. Rain, snow, hail, wind, etc., is used to create a specific mood for each scene and setting. The characters are well-developed and interesting. In fact there are many character traits that have nothing to do with the story; they are there simply for background. The acting is amazing. Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, and all the supporting actors give great performances. The movie is very suspenseful and sucks you into the story within the first ten minutes. That being said, despite the two and a half hour run-time, I was not bored for one second! The entire movie has a pervasive feeling of dread and unpleasantness. The entire thing is very emotionally disturbing, depressing, and hard to watch.

Jackman and Gyllenhall are good in this..as are Viola Davis, Terrance Howard, and Melissa Leo..though their roles are very small. At 2 /2 hours is does however keep you interested. The first few scenes are contrived..but then it ropes you in. The cinematography is gritty and grainy, and not a film for kids. It is pretty brutal in places but not gratuitous. This is a film worth seeing, with the tension of the film ""Ransom"" If you like movies that keep you guessing and wondering what happens next this is for you. The director seems to really know where to put the camera to make you feel like you are there. Gyllenhall gives a troubled performance worthy to see.

This one has you from start to finish forcing you to examine your own views and the lengths that you would go to placed in that situation. The entire movie has no sunshine. It's cold, wet and miserable. I think that's just to give the characters a little more texture though. Go see it if you want an edge of your seat thriller on a Sunday afternoon.

774,22 August 2015,aseemksh,8, Prisoners,"Slow burn thrillers are a dying breed. Most modern suspense films go in for gruesome and violent stories of murder to send chills down spines of the audience. A lot of this pictures offer mysteries that are not too difficult to decipher. So it is a great pleasure to discover that there filmmakers out there adventurous enough to craft a dark, intriguing dialogue driven motion picture that keeps the audience guessing for most its runtime. That director Denis Villeneuve does so with panache and some wonderfully orchestrated darkness is what elevates the material beyond escapist territory. The story is set in a Philadelphia suburb where two families the Dovers; Keller (Hugh Jackman) and Grace (Maria Bello) and the Birches, Franklin (Terence Howard) and Nancy (Viola Davis) are celebrating Thanksgiving together. The parents are enjoying themselves indoors while the two young girls decide to go out and play. After a certain amount of time, the parents realise that the two have not returned. After some frantic reconnoitering it is decided that the police need to be called in and the case is assigned to Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). A few preliminary investigations lead him to a suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano), but subsequent interrogations reveal that he lacks the intellect and the malevolence that is expected from one who has committed such a crime. He is eventually released much to the chagrin of Keller who is convinced that Jones is involved in the girls' disappearance. Filled with righteous indignation he decides that he will take matters into his own hands. While an engaging whodunit is all that is expected from a picture like this one, it is quite amazing to see how Prisoners not only aspires to be something more than just a by-the-numbers thriller. The original script by Aaron Guzikowski is an intelligent creation with some really astute observations about human nature. Difficult themes like anger, redemption, guilt, punishment and even religion find a home in this dark and at times depressing story. The film's rather chunky 153 minute runtime and the slow, deliberate pace which the story progresses gives the characters and their emotions a lot of breathing space. Though there were occasions when I found myself questioning the persistence of the director in allowing certain scenes to carry on even when their purpose in the narrative has been realised. To be fair these moments are few and far between which is why they tend to stick out. It is not possible to fully discuss the emotional weight of the story without divulging the specifics of the plot but suffice to say that the script is never guilty of feeding the audience any answers and the resolution is satisfying and I personally could not guess it beforehand. The excellent direction allows the story to be engaging at all times. The cautious building up of suspense, the natural dialogue, and the nuanced presentation are top notch and there are times when I could detect echoes of David Fincher's modern classic Zodiac (2007) that are only amplified by the involvement of Jake Gyllenhaal. That is not to say Prisoners takes cues visual cues from Zodiac. It is its own beast, but is in several ways a spiritual companion of that picture. Prisoners would not have been anywhere close to being as effective, if it wasn't for the stellar cinematography of Roger Deakins. Deakins has long been acknowledged as one of the leading exponents of his craft and here his lens work enriches (if not outright create) the creepy atmosphere that film exudes. The way the camera pans and zooms; it could be argued that Deakins' camera is a character in itself. The music in contrast comes across as merely adequate, but is never overbearing and does not take the viewer out of the moment. The emotional crux is purely dependent on the performances and in that department there is nary a complaint I can make. Five members of the main cast have Academy Award nominations and everyone plays their respective roles with great conviction. Jake Gyllenhaal has built up an impressive resume over the years and this movie adds another feather to his cap. His detective Loki is reserved yet determined and the actor brings the right amount of dedication to his role. Though, he does tend to overplay one conspicuous tick that the character displays. Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the indignant, conflicted father who is willing to do whatever it takes to find his daughter is a highlight of the film. Long has the actor been under the shadow of his famous Superhero avatar. Liberated from formula he displays his talent with incredible force. Terence Howard, Viola Davis and Mario Bello do not have roles that are as hefty but they provide solid support. Paul Dano brings a lot vulnerability to Alex and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery make his mental defects seem believable. A quiet dialogue driven piece such as this one has the potential of falling into indulgence. But, prisoners never falls prey to that. There are times when the script slows down the proceedings but it is only to allow the audience a better view of the characters and their lives. Nevertheless, there is a significant of portion of the mainstream audience that may find this a little too dark and languid. But, for those who are patient enough to follow the director to the places he takes us in this picture the rewards are delectable, providing a cinematic experience that is rich, multi-layered and most of very memorable.",

Jake Gyllenhaal is a phenomenal actor but I must say so myself, this is his best performance by far. You can tell the directors and screen writers really took their time on this because the actors gave outstanding performances, and it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole 2 hours! In fact, at the very end I was left wanting more, but it couldn't have ended more perfectly leaving it to the audience's perception. Everything about this movie was amazing, saw it twice in theaters and about a dozen times more ever since. I have yet to find a suspenseful thriller to out do this one.",

783,4 October 2014,petkova,5, Horrible,"The only reason I give this movie 3 instead of one star is that acting wasn't bad. Acting alone however cannot make up for a totally stupid plot. There were so many inconsistencies in this movie that I don't know where to start. First, the movie seems to tell about the worst detective on planet Earth. He always goes alone to places where he can expect danger. He doesn't have the ability to interrogate people properly and do research - i.e. when he finds a dead body in the priest's cellar, he doesn't even take the time to interview the priest properly. The priest tries to tell him that the killer had a family, etc. but the detective just looks bored and thinks of a way to leave the room immediately. Even though in the beginning they arrest a guy under the suspicion of having a connection with the disappearance of the girls, they never bother to do a search of his house (we later find out the girls had been there all along). Also, although ALex is officially a suspect, they never make any checks on him, nor do they check his aunt's version of who he is. As it turns out later, her version is completely made up. well, if he is just one of the boys they kidnapped a long time ago, how did he even have identity papers, driving license, etc. How come the police never checks? The maze maps, Alex's words that the girls are in the maze, all leaves the impression that these maps will actually relate in some way to an actual physical place; however, the girls are simply in the aunt's house and apparently the countless mazes appearing in the film lead only to a medallion the uncle had. Also, Alex is portrayed as almost unable to talk but on the other hand when he speaks he does so perfectly coherently. The snakes are ridiculous. I could go on forever but just don't have the energy after all the time I lost watching this film! What shocks me the most is the high result this movie has on IMDb and the hype in the comments. Absolutely undeserved!!!",
784,9 February 2021,Jackblyth8,10, The Film Everyone Didn't Know They Had to Watch,"Begging the question: How far would you go to save, protect or rescue a loved one?, 'Prisoners' requires impeccable focus to advance across the storyline. Bound to keep you on the edge of your seat, the thriller is one to keep you guessing, emphasising the frustration of uncertainty. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as an assertive and confrontational detective, the best in the department, portraying his role perfectly. Similarly, Hugh Jackman captures the emotions caused by the loss of a loved one, and how ultimately it can lead you to becoming a bad person. Set in a cold Pennsylvania, Keller (Jackman) and Grace Dover along with their two children Anna and Ralph, celebrate thanksgiving at Franklin and Nancy Birch's home, the pair also have two children; Joy and Eliza. Embracing the cheerful period, the families are seen playing games and sharing a meal. The four children walk through the neighbourhood, and come across an old RV, after realising there is someone inside, the girls stop playing on it and are made to head home by Eliza and Ralph. Later, the parents can't find Joy and Anna, assuming they are missing, Grace calls the police, informing them about the rugged RV Ralph had explained about. Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is pictured in a desolate food hall, before receiving the news. He quickly identifies the RV and obtains an awkward looking man who attempted to flee. During interrogation, the man, named Alex, possesses an extremely low IQ, proving that the ability to kidnap and hide two young children is unlikely one of his capabilities. The RV is searched, and no forensic evidence is found. Furious, Hugh Jackman's character approaches Loki, convinced that Alex is to blame. Keller then challenges Alex by the police station, threatening him over a car bonnet, the scared individual responds by whispering to Keller ""they didn't cry until I left them"". Keller reports the statement to Loki and his chief, but because there is no real proof he said it, they can't take further action. Keller slowly watches Alex at night from a distance, the character appears to be taking his dog out for a walk, but strangely strangles it for a few seconds then returns it to the ground. Creepily, he echoes a song sang by the two girls at the dinner party to himself, causing Dover to square up to him once again. Jackman's character takes Alex to an abandoned building that his father left for him, imprisoning the suspect and abusing him until he tells him where the girls are. Loki tracks down all the local peodophiles in the area and enters the home of a drunken Priest, Father Patrick Dunn, gingerly the detective enters Dunn's basement and finds a corpse with a unique necklace around its neck. During questioning, the Priest admits to killing the man, only because he confessed to murdering 16 children. Loki then speaks with a woman, who's son was taking from her 20 years ago. At a memorial get-together to raise awareness of the missing girls, Loki identifies a suspicious character who runs away as soon as he is spotted by the detective, after an intense chase, the dubious figure escaped. Loki drew an image of the suspect and after it was placed on the news, a store clerk claimed he comes to the store every week to buy children's clothes. Named Bob Taylor, the character is seen breaking into the Dover's and Birch's home, before swiftly leaving. Grace is woken by a noice she hears from Anna's room, convinced it was her she calls the police, Loki arrives and spots her medication in abundance, assuming that she is psychologically unstable. Loki understands that Keller isn't home at night, and the next day follows him to the abandoned building, Keller then spots Loki and suggests he should be looking for his daughter rather than following him. Loki appears again at the building but this time Dover is torturing Alex, Keller then lies on the first floor and acts as if it is a place to hide his alcohol problems from his wife. Loki receives a call from the clerk alerting him that Bob had just left the store and she was able to see his registration plate. The detective shows up at the suspect's house and instantly arrests him, Loki is met by a room full of locked boxes obtaining snakes and bloodstained children's clothes. The house walls are covered in sketches of maze's, supposedly leading to dead body's. Paranoid, Taylor is made to sketch and explain the maze in custody, the agitated and frustrated detective approaches him aggressively after taking too long, causing two other cops to control Loki, Taylor then grabs an officer's gun in the commotion and kills himself before the location of the girls is admitted. Loki calls in the Birch's and Keller to show them the photos of clothing found at Taylor's home. They confirm that some pictures match the girl's clothing. Livid, Dover blames Loki for the death of his daughter. Alex mutters to Dover about escaping a maze, but struggles to talk further, forcing Keller to torture him more. Keller arrives at the home of Holly, Alex's aunt, to apologise for her nephew's disappearance. She explains that his speech disability comes from a childhood accident involving her husband's snakes and that adopting Alex was a way to cope with the death of their son. After finding child manikins buried by Taylor's house, Loki looks for footprints by the window left open in Grace's room during their possible breaking - not only does the detective find footprints, but also the pairing sock said to be Anna's and pictured bloodstained. Loki realises that Taylor isn't the killer and that the girls may well be still alive. Joy is found and situated in hospital, Keller asks her where Anna is and she responds by telling him that ""he was there"". Keller rushes out of the hospital, barging past Loki and his men. Jake Gyllenhaal' character follows but loses him, and turns up at the abandoned building only to find a tortured, battered and bruised Alex. Instead, the protagonist arrives again at Holly's home to ""talk"", she soon puts a gun to him and explains that all Alex wanted to do was take the girls for a ride in his RV, but it was her who demanded they stayed. Holly supports her abduction by stating it is a part of the war against god, for taking away her only child. She then locks Keller into a dark underground mine after shooting him in the leg and mentions sinisterly that she hopes he is still alive when he throws his daughter's dead body down there. Keller looks around the confined space, finding the red whistle that Anna once gave to him. The police manage to relocate Alex to his real parents, following his disappearance that was mentioned earlier in the film. In the act of informing Holly about the findings of her ""nephew"", Loki arrives at the site where Keller is situated. He enters Holly's home subtly and assumes nobody is home, he spots a photo where Holly and her husband are pictured, her husband appears to wear the same necklace as the man in the priests basement and on it the maze that Taylor sketched; he slowly approaches Holly attempting to drug and kill Anna, they both shoot each other, Loki is wounded and kills Holly. The detective takes the weakened child and rushes to the hospital; the combination of blood covering his right eye and torrential rain, the drive is destined to end fatally, but, exemplifying his high-profile, Loki is able to hand Anna over to the medics and have her fixed up. The following morning, Grace and Anna visit the injured Loki, who admits when Keller is found it is most likely he will go to jail. Whilst watching the EGT officers search the banded premises of Holly's home, Loki sees them off, and, while gazing into the distance, he hears a faint whistle from a distance. The gloomy and dark surroundings personify the disappearing mystery. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is exquisite , mastering the characters professionalism mixing with aggravation. The moving story ends brilliantly yet annoyingly, supposedly allowing viewers to make up there own ending. In honest truth it makes sense that the focus of the film was achieved in finding Anna, and for Hugh Jackman's character to also be rescued, but arrested, may take light off what is really significant.",

I dare say that without the participation of Jackman and Gyllenhaal, a certain number of people will not be able to watch it.

The pacing the timing was so awful. There were a lot of unnecessary scenes that could have been shortened or not used in the movie at all. I can say at at least 1 hour of the movie could be cut out and the story wouldn't change, in fact it would be better. The slow rhythm of the movie made it like drama more than a thriller. There were parts where it got really really boring. Jake Gyllenhaal's bad acting made the movie even worse. And it had the worse ending ever. The only thing good about the movie is Hugh Jackman.

Jake Gyllenhaal was an excellent investigator and i loved his portrayal of the determination to find out who the kidnapper was. However he wasn't a fraction as good as Hugh Jackman who had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. Although he played the enemy, i really sympathised with Paul Dano. I've only ever seen him in one other film (Knight and Day) but i thought he was also a great addition to the cast. Although the cast was good, i would have liked to see a little more from the mother (Maria Bello). I found the ending predictable although i never had a clue who the kidnapper was right up until the last moments. I personally, found some of the scenes with Hugh Jackman a little difficult to watch although others might disagree. Overall i was shocked by how good this film actually was and i would definitely recommend it to others!",

A common central idea, then, the child abduction case, where the police can't do much and the child's father tries to do everything possible to figure out and find his child. Even torture the prime suspect until he confesses what happened to the children. The film is a prime example of how a good but ordinary idea can lead to a very good result through excellent performances, especially by Hugh Jackman, but also the rest, very good directing and a fairly well-crafted and serious film overall. The result is to make the film one of the best in the crime/kidnapping category. Hugh Jackman alone is already a guarantee for a remarkable film but in this one there was quite a good job overall in everything. It's recommended to everyone.",

I would strongly disagree. Jake Gyllenhall and Hugh Jackman were amazing. In fact all the actors were amazing but these two killed it. The movie, according to me, had lots more potential, could have been one of the best mystery movies EVER made, but much of the movie still remained a mystery. Questions like, why the child was kidnapped, what happened to Hugh Jackman afterwards, were still left unanswered after the movie ended. It needed answers, and this is why the ending was sad too. The movie was very long and I wouldn't have mind watching another half hour for these answers. It did build up lots of suspense, but I also feel that they added parts that had no need to be in the film, just over elongated the film. Nevertheless, I would still recommend you watch it, but don't expect too much.",

It didn't disappoint. Within the first few minutes an atmosphere is unwrapped that sucks you into its cold and rainy heart, beating slowly but disturbingly intense. The presence of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't interrupt at any time as they manage to develop highly believable characters in a dark and depressing yet fascinating setting. You might think that the story maybe isn't redefining the wheel, but it's told in such a deep and awfully calm way that you won't find any reasons to question it at all. It's power lies in dealing with natural human fears, which we probably never will be truly able to withstand. I don't like reviews getting too much into detail, as to my mind nearly every trailer does, so summing it up I would highly recommend this movie to everyone who likes suspense best served subliminal, such as in Mystic River, I Saw the Devil or The Hunt.",

822,19 October 2013,zahrababy29,8, Heart Wrenching Piece,I have watched various films much like a psychological thriller but nothing has ever come close to this. The prisoner with the talents of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhall keep you on the edge of your seat. The most interesting thing is when you finally get to grips with what is going on you see the plot go the opposite direction. But be warned that this film is very related to reality and the emotions experienced by parents in the most unimaginable darkest hour of ones life. The emotions explored in this film will leave you will a scar that will never be removed I felt as though I was somehow glued to my seat. Hugh Jackman has very much secured himself a Oscar in my eyes and I hope you agree with me to. Jake plays very much out of his comfort zone and it is a wonderful ride. But the cinematography really opened doors don't be fooled by the dark moment in between every scene it is very much worth it. If you have not yet seen this film it is one to keep in mind because it is one that will surely be worth while.,

With a film that is solely carried by the amazing portrayal and writing of the main protagonist and its sweet brutal violence, much can be enjoyed from what is truly a middle of the road action flick. Much of the flaws lie through a generic action plot, an overly cliché villain, and an underdeveloped set of characters that the film should had laid a steady foundation for before getting into the true meat of the movie.

The film tries to be Mystic River and Seven at the same time. Was it a drama? Was it trying to be suspenseful? It fails both way. It's too full of thriller clichés to feel dramatic, it's too morally ambiguous to be an entertaining thriller. Everything is quite good: acting is great, the atmosphere too, and Villeneuve is a great director.

Excellent interpretation of Hugh Jackman who exudes the pain of a father who sees his daughter disappear from a moment. Leaves something to be desired the character starring Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki), which seems to keep a detached attitude and shallow for the whole course ot the interlacing and then, inexplicably, spurting determination and investigative spirit to the very last frames.

Everyone's acting was perfect. Although, there's one thing that I'm curious of. I feel very pitiful for Alex. How he was tortured into talking but he just never talked!? I don't understand why!? I know Hugh Jackman felt bad for the hurt he's doing to the man but I can't really blame him. Was there a reason that he was being so conservative on the information he gave about the missing girls? I hope he's okay now and I hope he has learned his lesson. I also hope that Hugh Jackman gets rescued at the end. He may go to prison but I sure do hope that it won't be too long.

I know the main actors from other movies, I liked their acting in other movies, but in this one it was awful. May be not the actors itself, the problem is the movie, the plot, the script, the director. I like easy movies, I also like complex movies, when you need to think to know what is going on. But this one is none of that, it's just plain stupid, nothing makes sense, from beginning to end. Horrible ending. And I'm not talking about happy or unhappy ending, I'm talking about a just plain and stupid ending. I don't know with what I'm more angry, with the few stupid people that make this movie or with the thousands that rated them in IMDb to reach an 8.1. All this without entering into what is left by this movie. It shouts all over the movie, torture is fine if you think you're right, is more than fine, is THE way to proceed if you really care.

A great story, but the only complaint you might see is that the story has been done before in some regards - it is a kidnapping story. That said, I'm OK as long as it's not direct plagiarism, isn't the same characters (i.e. Taken, Taken 2), and is well-directed and well-acted, which is certainly true in this case. I think Jackman somewhat underplayed his role, while Gyllenhall played the part perfectly. It left you with some questions at the end, and some parts were nostalgic cliché moments that just felt out of place.

I don't think this is a perfect movie even though I rated it a 10/10. If IMDB had more precise rating I would rate it a 9.7/10. The plot is a 10/10. And the ending is perfect the only draw back is that there is very little evidence proving who the real culprit was. I'm trying not to spoil anything. The movie is very good not movies are equal.

But I didn't fall asleep. On a scale of one to one hundred, I would score it an 85. That is a pretty good number from me, so I must have liked it. It is much easier for me to point out what I didn't like, than what I did.  I think Hugh Jackman did a good job, but his character (Keller Dover) was a little over the top. I'm not sure how that happened, but I suspect the director, Denis Villeneuve, might have been responsible. Subtract five points.  Unfortunately the film followed the same slothful path as do so many lesser movies— blame conservative Christianity. Subtract five points for laziness and cowardice.  We are led to believe that the character Franklin Birch (played by Terrence Howard) would not be held accountable for the kidnapping and repeated beatings (which led to his death) of character Alex Jones (played by Paul Dano). The charge is felony murder, and he would be prosecuted. Subtract three points.  My popcorn had too much butter. Subtract one point. Everything else about the move was great. I left the theater with a good feeling. I would recommend that ""Prisoners"" and Sean Penn's ""The Pledge"" (Jack Nicolson, Benicio Del Toro, Patricia Clarkson and Beau Daniels) be bundled. The similarities are striking. I gave ""The Pledge"" a strong ninety-nine when I saw it in 2001. Both films are on my top 100 list of contemporary movies.",

Well, I guess it starts with the script... The script for this movie is doing several things that I consider insulting for the viewers. First, it gives you all the information in advance on a silver platter, there are no real surprises in the movie (though you keep hoping there will be some), but the clues are so visible and obvious that anyone who ever had to solve a logical question, should be able to understand the plot pretty much from the beginning... It also tries to shock the viewer in order to convey the characters' dilemmas. It's an easy and cheap way of conveying a message. I find it more effective and lasting when the ideas are presented to me to digest than being thrown at my face, trying to force me consider issues that I don't even think are worth my consideration. The movie is full packed with gaping holes in the plot. Things that just don't make much sense in 2013, and Jake's character, as a detective, seems to simply be a very bad, incapable detective. ",

895,10 April 2020,KittieC,4, Staring Hugh Jackman as Liam Neeson,"I feel like everyone is trying super hard, but even with it's distended length, Prisoners only just manages to be ok.
I know Hugh Jackman is talented as heck, a national treasure, and a delightful guy but as a dramatic actor he just doesn't do it for me. He plays every scene for the cheap seats - you can almost see him reaching deeply to bring every ounce of angst or anger up. He serves a lot of aces but I just don't see enough subtlety for him to sustain a thrilling rally.
As the dad straining at his limits of humanity in his quest to find his daughter, Jackman is a working class Neeson-in-Taken facsimile striking one note for several hours.
The supporting cast is incredible on paper, but no-one other than Gyllenhaal and Melissa Leo gets anything to work with. Paul Dano and Terrence Howard in particular are wasted terribly.
The plot feels like a Scandi Noir relocated to the mid west. It's also twists and turns, bizarre coincidence, red herrings, and tricky symbolism. I feel like they could have junked a fair amount and tightened into either a cracking thriller, or amped up the psychological tension of Jackman's character descending into darkness.
Alternatively, a limited series format could have allowed some of the sub plots and spirals to develop a bit more (although then it would have basically been The Killing).
For my money, too much of everything added up to not much of anything, which is a shame because it's clear everyone showed up with conviction.",

How the authorities and their parents respond to this horrific event is at the core of this film exploring the biblical phrase ""an eye for an eye"", the nature of sin, and its roots in life's tragic adversities.

The camera, the acting of Jake Gyllanhal, and the mystery are the stars in this one. The mood is somber amidst a tragic abduction of two girls in a small Pennsylvania town. I immediately felt connected and invested in the story and eager to see how far the characters would go to solve the mystery.

921,25 March 2014,haris-m26,10, Some merits and DE merits of the movie,The movie was awesome and mind blowing. but the main reason that i rated it 9 and not 10 is because it was very slow and at some times boring also. at many points it seemed that may be there are just stretching for example the part in which Hugh Jackson goes again and again to the house to beat that poor kid. Over all the movie was good and it was full of surprises. even till the end of the movie i was pretty much sure that the kid Hugh Jackson has locked up was the culprit but that old lady just came out of no where. another thing that i didn't like was that they left the movie like an open book. they should have concluded it and should have shown that her daughter was safely retrieved at that she was again re united with her family. leaving the movie like this was giving to ideas that may be that kid was never found and she died in that deep dark hole.,

935,3 June 2014,jackmancuso54,10," Dense, Haunting, Realistic, And The Best Film of 2013.","""Prisoners"" is a film that floored me on my first viewing and enthralled me on my second. Like most films with a central mystery, Prisoners takes its concept and unravels it into a giant web of intrigue, trapping its viewer and engulfing them in its gloomy universe. However, upon my second viewing, I realized what a dense, symbolic and haunting film this really is. This is without a doubt the best film of 2013: no other drama released this year managed to tap into human fears and desires this well. Every performance is impeccable, namely from the two leading men, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Jackman is the crushed, brokenhearted father, consumed by rage and agony in his desperate attempts to reunite his family. Early in the film, he tells his son to ""be ready. It doesn't matter if it's a hurricane, flood, anything."" Perhaps it is either cruel irony or his character Keller Dover not heeding his own advice, but the way he is forced off the deep end as his psyche crumbles is both draining and curious to watch. Gyllenhaal's character has the most complete development in the film. A man who begins as a straight-shooting detective with a spotless record is transformed by Gyllenhaal into a man tortured by the work he held so dear, a man frozen in fear by his first real challenge in the line of duty. Every supporting performance is airtight and contributes to the film's slow-burning and unbearably tense atmosphere. Every shot lingers on for a time that floats between comfortable and uncomfortable. The cinematography by Roger Deakins and direction by Denis Villenueve are beautiful and capture some incredible shots throughout the film's massive run time. This contrast between direction and editing is one of the many contrasts in Prisoners, most of which are revealed through the film's deep-rooted symbolism. The imagery of crosses and The Lord's Prayer contrast deeply with Jackman's torture of Paul Dano's character throughout the film. The use of mazes as both a symbol and a plot device is ingenious, as the maze is seen to represent a sort of prison, in which the viewer realizes every character is trapped in after seeing the degree to which all of them have been trapped in their vices. The density and intelligence contained in this filmmaking was unmatched throughout the year of 2013. Prisoners is an incredible film and a must-watch for any lover of cinema.",
936,25 September 2013,stephen_delaunay,6, Bait and Switch,"Prisoners offers itself as a ""thriller"" that transcends the genre, but the hype is a con job. It's too slow-paced to generate real gut level excitement, too logically flawed for the intellectual appeal it strives for. Naturally, there's an emotional reaction to the chilling theme of child abduction. That along with the overall quality of the filmmaking will briefly create the impression that this is serious stuff. The rambunctious performance of Hugh Jackman as the semi-civilized father of the abducted child and fine performances across the board, notably Jack Gyllenhaal as the detective, will also earn some admiration. But the notion that this is a great movie is a fleeting illusion. This movie will be soon forgotten. ",

It was a couple of years ago and I was 14-15 years old. I was hanging out with my cousin in my living-room, it was late at night (02:00 AM) and I felt ready to go to bed. My cousin had other plans and somehow managed to talk me into putting on this weird movie I´d never heard of, ""Prisoners"". I was not a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal and I only recognized Hugh Jackman from the X-Men movies and I didn´t really think of him as a good or even capable actor. I thought he got his parts in movies because of his impressive physique and great looks. I had never heard of the director (Dennis Villeneuve) and really doubted he had ever made anything worth watching (keep in mind that I was very young, dumb, pissed off and tired at this point).

Anna's father, a middle-aged man interpreted by Hugh Jackman, will do anything to find her. The cast includes Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki and Paul Dano as the first suspect of the case.

This is Denis Villeneuve breakout movie and he is one of the best director of the 2010s. He made one of the most complex and the most intense movies of the last 2010s. If I have to give three movies to explain it; Sicario, Enemy, and this movie Prisoners. For this movie, this is not for the weak stomach and I will say it once, this is so good. This is a complex and deep in the rabbit hole, you will not know who is the good or the evil. By recent years Roger Deakins the cinematographer is collaborating with Dennis Villeneuve which that makes the more better part. This movie will have the cinematography that not a lot of modern day movies will have and that makes it more intense. Prisoners is a modern day classic but not a lot of people will know this classic. So if you think that you are a movie buff and you are into a lot of movies, go see this movie and I bet you, you will be excited to his next work and you will have the best time in recent years for a movie.",

The story is absolutely superb, with the countless twists and turns throughout the film making me feel as if I were connecting the dots, like a detective. However the actual detective in this film, was a character that well executed in terms of character building, as well as well acted out by Jake Gyllenhaal.

Hugh Jackman played this character with such conviction and really portrayed his character's rage, depression and sadness throughout the film. The soundtrack, now I though that the soundtrack is something that would fly over most people's heads when reviewing this film, but in the moments of silence with only the music, it truly did send me goose bumps and left my jaw either clenched in suspense and anticipation.

But even the ending proved to be predictable and anti-climactic. A real shame, as the story itself is a good one - it's how it's told lets it down.

He's the director of the new Dune for Christ sake?! This is his magnum opus for sure. My only possible critique is that they could trim 15mins off it cuz it runs a little long. Other than that, it's a perfect film. The whole thing is dark, tense, with plot twists that you never see coming and a villain played to absolute perfection by the always awesome Paul Dano.

The problem is that a basic cog in the plot is just wrong. The explanation for why the crimes were committed (I'm trying hard to avoid spoilers) was to make people turn away from god. I believe that most of us know that nearly all child abductions by strangers are sexually motivated, but this movie goes out of its way to assure us that the girls were ""never touched."" Well, then, why keep them alive, just semi-conscious in the back room or in a hole in the ground? It's as if the terrible violence committed against one innocent in this movie were all the makers felt we could bear; the thought that the survivors had been raped apparently made them more queasy than what was done to a mentally deficient man. Had they been brave enough to allow the completely reasonable sexual motive be behind the crimes, this would have been, for me, a perfect movie.",

After two little girls go missing, a father takes matters into his own hands, meanwhile, the detective on the case chases leads into sometimes disturbing places. Prisoners is an incredibly tense and thoughtful film. It is filled with meticulous directing, beautiful cinematography, superb writing, heart-pounding music, seamless editing, and every praise that you can give a film. Hugh Jackman gives a truly Oscar-worthy performance as Keller Dover, the father of one of the missing girls. You can really feel his pain and agony as he desperately goes after the ones he thinks responsible for his daughter's disappearance. Jake Gyllenhaal also gives one his best performances as Detective Loki. As he investigates the disappearance of the two girls, you can empathize with his frustration that comes with a case like this. The film shows the more emotional side of this conflict through Maria Bello, who plays Jackman's wife in the film. Same with Terrence Howard and Viola Davis, who play the parents of the other girl who went missing. It is through those characters that you get to experience sympathy. Paul Dano plays a mentally ill person and a suspect in the investigation. He gives what is considered by many to be his best performance.",

Just was a bad movie bad movie bad movie, why the concept of snakes was introduced, also not showed the exact maze, I was very much disappointed with this and I have rated this as 1. I just registered in IMDb to give 1 rating to this movie",

Though it is not for the faint of heart, this incredible film takes you on a journey that you don't want to end. For me, this is ABSOLUTELY Hugh Jackman's BEST role he has ever done, even topping Les Miserables. This hair-raising thriller gives me an amazing exhilaration every. single. time. And I've seen the movie four times in the past month. With top-notch acting from Jake Gyllenhaal, this is one story you do NOT want to miss out on. You never question the dedication of Hugh as the father, as he takes things into his own hands to get his daughter back. You feel every fit of anger, every tear, every shiver Hugh feels down to your own core. With that said, i proudly give this film a 10 out of 10.",

You really need to focus tho because this is a film where if you switch off, lose the thred you'll be lost of the plot. I like to say that it's a watcher. Not that you can actually physical turn away its a sitter and you need to switch off your smartphones and sit on the couch and take notice.

Too disturbing for my tastes. Jake Gyllenhaal was quite good, very believable as his concerned character, and I felt what he felt more than once. However, he was utterly reckless as well in his role, so the runaway rogue cop was much less believable due to contrasting elements. And then, as all the pieces come together, the characters got rather thin and wooden, and the wrap up rather contrite, packaged too neatly for much of a reveal. Not my fav for a variety of reasons, and would have been just as happy not viewing. Do not recommend.",

I felt no suspense and no love towards the film which IMDb gave a grand total of 8.1 on.

It keeps you on the edge and in your seat if you allow it. I did wish both mother characters played a bigger role rather than a back seat. You really do not see any other police character members care. Really wished that all the character family members played a bigger role in the movie. The older girl in one family seem to just fade away from the movie. I felt the family characters played to much of a back seat. This movie has no concern parents in this town. It felt like a child was telling this story to us. I felt the movie was to long. This movie did not have enough scary scenes. I also felt the writing of the characters did not say much about who they were. There was no history and no front story to any of the characters in the beginning of the movie.,

1045,17 October 2020,Anatolie,9, Interesting and mesmerizing detective film.,"I watched this movie with bated breath. It's really great psychological crime thriller what tells about the resistance of good and evil within oneself. The film is very exciting, the duration of the fiilm is two and a half hours, but they passed very quickly.
The plot is not bad, with many plot twists. The story always went in an unexpected direction. There were some plot jambs that confused me a little, for example why at the end the police did not take fingerprints from the Keller's bags that he brought Holly's home, and some more things.
Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman are incredible, Paul Dano is also very good. Was very mesmerizing to watch Hugh Jackman acting, I think this is his best role. But I couldn't empathize with the main characters. The rest of the characters were played by good actors, but the characters themselves turned out to be a little empty. For example I would really like to know more about the son of the main character. What I liked the most about the film was the visual. Roger Deakins does his job admirably. Composition of the frame, the color scheme is just magic. Also, I can't help but mention the soundtrack, it is very atmospheric, from which goosebumps.
In general, it's not a masterpiece and not the best Denis Villeneuve movie, but it's really great film. You probably won't want to rewatch this movie, but still need to look once.",

It isn't just about the plot (which was amazing), or the location (also perfect), but what blew my mind were the performances. I watched most of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal movies but this one will mark as their memorable work... You get to go deep into the life of the father whose daughter was just kidnapped, and who struggles against society, family and himself to find her. Jake also performs greatly as a tough policeman who doesn't trust anyone nor anything, yet he tries to find the girls regardless of the circumstances.. I got to say, I had no faith in this summer regarding the movie world, because let's be honest, there wasn't one good movie before this one..

The one word that describes this movie is tension! Until the very end, you do not know what is actually going on. You see one destroyed, desperate father willing to do anything to save his daughter and you sympathize with him even when you see that there is no limit that he wouldn't cross just to see his loved ones safe. Every single scene of this movie has it's meaning because it represents a part of a brilliant puzzle which unravels slowly to reveal such disturbing ending. Remarkable acting is followed by fantastic music and all those parts put together make this movie mind-blowing! It can't leave you indifferent.

I remembered blurbs of seeing it when it came out but now it had my full attention. I never like Jake Gyllenhaal but he stole the movie in my opinion as a misunderstood detective who is being constantly doubted by everyone at every turn.

Although all acting was overall excellent, Paul Dano's rendition especially captivated me. Wasn't a fun of all this pulp, but Dano's acting wouldn't let me rate this picture less than 9.

1087,10 November 2014,lewis230192,9, Boom!... and that's how you make a hard-hitting Crime Drama,I'm classing this as one of my favourite films of the year. These days it's a rarity to become engrossed in a film that can bend and snap your predictions of the outcome. ,
1088,18 November 2020,arjunrajagopal-41973,8, what would you do?,"Prisoners by Dennis Villeneuve is intense.
A hard hitting, emotionally distressing film that revolves around the disappearance of two young girls, constantly has audiences questioning what they would do in the situation presented.
The acting in this film is phenomenal, with Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman doing complete justice to the complex, intriguing characters they represent.
The film carries with it a sense of ambiguity, with many themes and morals being explored throughout.
Although the film travels in a slow and earnest manner, there are many incredibly gripping and dramatic scenes that are performed very well by the main cast.
With mainly rain, snow and storms the weather used also significantly adds to the all round atmosphere of the film by creating a dark, suspenseful and haunting mood.
I highly recommend to watch this film, if one is in the mood for a gritty, serious thriller with engaging acting performances. If IMDb provided a more inclusive rating system Prisoners would likely be closer to a 8.4 in my opinion.",

1091,29 April 2023,LoganFilms,10, Fall at Its Core,"Prisoners (2013) is a very disturbing movie, but at the same, oddly cozy. To me, this movie is the perfect ""Fall"" movie. The soundtrack is slow and methodical accompanied by Villeneuve's masterful visuals. This film feels like a warning to anyone willing to listen and dive into the minds of its main characters. Everyone is a prisoner to something and as the characters deal with this in separate ways, even deplorable acts can become somewhat justifiable. Villeneuve is able to expertly weave an incredibly gripping masterpiece of visual storytelling along with amazing acting. Jake Gyllenhaal is especially good, his small twitches and contrasting sudden bursts of rage blend so well together. Prisoners is a perfect example of the darkness ahead, but just out of sight. It's the perfect fall movie because of the knowledge of approaching cold storms and the feeling of not being able to stop them. The ending is also incredibly unique and I've yet to see another movie even attempt a similar style ending. Overall, Incredible!",

It started too slow and it was boring to begin with, however as it continues it was able to capture my attention. It wasn't what I was coming for but I'll l take it. All the ending was spectacular. There are some flaws on it however. For example the acting of some characters is not the best. There were a lot of plot holes. Jake Gylenhaal and Paul Dano though did amazing. They were great in characters. Overall and okay film to watch. If you just want to chill for the night you can definitely watch this. The movie isn't bad it just lacks engagement in the beginning but the pace gets better I promise.",
1093,12 September 2014,gdjorgs,10, An outstanding crime thriller.,"Prisoners is an outstanding film that surprised me. It is so realistic, and even though the story line isn't the most original, the story feels fresh and harsh. The performances are outstanding and every character feels real and lends to the film. Hugh Jackman plays a stern father who lies in a gray area of morality, and is worn down as the film progresses. Viola Davis, Terrance Howard, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo, and the other cast members are incredible each in their own ways. But who really stands out is Jake Gyllenhaal, as a twitchy, aggressive, young detective with secrets. His interactions with the other characters and the situation is beautiful and perfect. Rodger Deakins spectacular cinematography creates a dreary yet beautiful world for the characters to play in and makes the film perfect. Prisoners is definitely worth your money and your time and a instant example of incredible film making.",

1095,27 September 2013,researchwriter,5," Protracted, long-winded with an uninspired ending...",Went to watch this movie today with my friend after noticing the high rating at IMDb... Started off well ....but the progression and pace were lacking. The cast was also not so convincing with Jake Gyllenhall in the lead role. The lazy face did not match up to the thrill. Forest Whitaker would have been better as the detective.(even with his sleepy looks). Though the storyline tries to maintain an element of surprise and tension for the greater part of the movie the enactment was too slow and did not have the gripping effect that good thriller movies provide. It is not the edge of the seat kind of movie ..rather a movie where u relax and stretch yourself several times waiting to get up from the seat.The story gets jumbled and the movie looses its grip in the second half. Does not deserve the high 8 rating.. definitely not!! Would like to avoid this kind of dull dragging movies.....Watch at home ....However i won't ask for my money back..they don't give anyway :),

The acting is phenomenal, i can't critisize that part, but everything else was tiring, unnecessarily long, like I constantly felt I am wasting my time, because after we hit the 2 hour mark we still don't know anything about the girls or the reason and after the movie ended I still don't know anything. Why did that woman wanted to kill the children again? She talked about some kind of demons, she related this whole thing to religion obviously which I don't mind, and I liked her comparing the parents to demons, but what the hell was this 3 hour long movie?

They get her back, but we don't see her coming face to face with her father again. Really silly and left me shaking my head at the writers and director. Daughter being found but not reunited with her father after all that he went through was stupid. It was if they cut that scene out to save running time.

I started watching this accidentally one day and then ended up streaming it later to finish watching, so it was enough out of the gate to keep me interested. Several things I do not get (SPOILERS), such as: 1) Why did the one suspect kill himself in the police station when it was obvious he wasn't the kidnapper? 2) They explained the ""boy"" had mental problems and had the iq of a 10- year old. They showed a scene where he signed his name, clearly understanding what he was told. Yet he wouldn't say one word to he police and then to the father about the girls despite getting beaten over several days. Even a 10-year old understands the situation. 3) How did they find the black girl? It was never mentioned how she got away, just that ""they found her"". 4) When the black girl spoke to the father, why wasn't she questioned before that? Why were there no police there already in the room to protect her and question her? 5) The black girl gave him a clue as the location of where they were held, enough that he knew where to go. They then show the police chasing after him to stop him. What grounds did they have to stop him from doing anything when they didn't know anything about what he knew or where he was going? Why didn't he tell them to follow him if he was so damn sure? 6) When he entered the woman's house, he turns his back to her knowing full well she was the kidnapper. When he went there, I was anticipating how he would handle it, coming out directly at first or just playing it sly. He had a gun, it should have been accessible from the moment he knocked on the door and you never let them out of your sight!",

Totally taken by surprise by the amount of viewers who gave this film a poor review. Those types of viewers aren't able to simply enjoy a flick; instead they spend their entire time looking for problems in a movie - therefore their reviews need to be disregarded because the only type of movie that could ever convince them is one taken from a live cell phone for 2 hours of some real-time event like a city-held event such as a parade or something. ,

Poor fellow that is a suspect pulls off his usual role in the character as a simpleton or a shyster. Jake Gyllenehaal's playing the detective excellent. Enjoyed Jake's acting in many roles. Always a believable character study playing his role to the hilt. Hugh is flat out obnoxious-n-lousy. I believe he is whizzed for accepting the role and lives it thru the moron he plays,,, regrettable flat as a pancake, not believable because the script sucks so bad. Script is a silly pot pourrie calabash of bi-poplar keystone cops. Parents character's of both girls are scripted so ridiculously its barely watchable.

After seeing the movie, i am not quiet sure whether I have seen the same movies as people how have rated it high?

Iwas astonished by the acting in the movie, and how they brought it closer to us. Such serious performances, and it's not the ordinary plot where we end up celebrating the hero.

As a swiftie myself I do tend to have a negative opinion on Jake Gyllenhaal but I throughly enjoyed his performance. I would say the film dragged on a little through the middle but did think it was need at times.

I think the actors were great choices. I was definitely surprised in the turn of events and the suspense was amazing. I feel as though the girls initial choice in the beginning, was a little ridiculous as well. Also, the neglect of the law enforcement was very discouraging, as my Uncle is a detective.

There are many scenes in vivid detail where people are being beaten and tortured; the director does not suggest these details in any subtle way whatsoever. And the fact that the whole premise revolves around the kidnapping, drugging, and harming children just makes it unbearable.

Because it generally doesn't work well, to me, it's prominent inclusion in the film is damagingly and offensively tasteless. I'm talking about the use of human torture to extract information. I'll concede you get information using it, but often quite unreliable information as the victim concocts anything they can think of to stop the torture. Especially in a situation of uncertain guilt, it is a really stupid way to proceed. And I hate brutality being glorified.",

I was too much excited to see the movie, however, after that i was shocked. the The movie was completely destroyed by the director, although the acting is very great but you can feel the movie is very heavy & tense (in a bad way).",
1145,10 January 2021,willembree3,8, Jake Gyllenhaal sux,"This is a phenomenal movie, profound cinematography, but I cannot get over how horribly wrong the casting directors were for casting Jake Gyllenhaal instead of Ryan Gosling for detective Loki! Gyllenhaal fabricated a character tic, incessant eye blinking, which could have added perhaps an obsessive disposition to his character development but in an interview he gave no legitimate reason as to why he chose eye blinking, totally arbitrary. It honestly just makes me upset because this is such a good movie otherwise, Jake Gyllenhaal simply ruins it.",

Jake Gyleenhaal and Hugh Jackman did a very good job. They probably have showed their best performance so far. Although, the supporting acts gave a sufficient but not stunning performances.

I have to say I wasn't expecting the ending at all. Usually, you can guess how it will end midway through, but I couldnt seem to wrap my head around anything! It was actually exciting to see how it would end. Huge plot twist. Its always the people you would least expect! The acting was amazing from all characters. Its the type of movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The only thing I kind of wish was different at the ending was to see the Dad finally getting reunited to his daughter. Nonetheless, amazing and I totally recommend watching it!",

1154,15 March 2015,Kim-crosier-264-518996,10, Alternate endings???,just watched this movie again on a premium movie channel. I swear it's got a different ending than when I rented the movie a couple of years ago. Was there a different ending filmed for the movie channel ending? Help! It's driving my husband and I crazy!!! In the movie channel version the movie ends with detective Loki hearing a whistle at Alex's house but then walking off screen. The rented version I remember had him recognizing that the car had been moved and finding Keller in the hole followed by Keller's trial and acquittal. What's up? Are my husband and I just making things up or was the movie released with alternate endings????? It's been driving us crazy and I don't see any mention of alternate endings anywhere in the IMDb information.,
1155,29 September 2018,ryanderekjames,1, 2 hours too long with an obvious plot,"Shocking, slow paced and obvious. I guessed the outcome of every scene and plot twist, the film is far too long and full of endless and pointless scenes. Jakes cop performance was dreadful and considering the plot made him out to be a top detective who'd never left a case unsolved, he didn't connect any evidence and wouldn't have solved anything he hadn't circumstancially stumbled across. His ultimate lack of energy or pace was mind numbing to say the least and with such an incredible cast it was embarrassing that they hardly had anything to do with the story. Jackmans wife was in bed the whole time and the other family were completely overlooked. I could go on and on about this terrible story line that never really made any sense and left 2.5 hours of unanswered questions and pointless plot twists. I couldn't recommend avoiding this film enough!",

It has deservedly won multiple awards for cinematography and it is visually absolutely breathtaking. Although initially somewhat formulaic with the missing daughter the plot is not predictable, the script is tight and the acting is subtle.

The base of the story is simple. Two young girls are kidnapped, and a father and detective work to get them back.

Sir Roger Deakins' beautifully composed shots and lighting, and Jóhann Jóhannsson's exceptional, hair-raising score make the whole movie experience not only suffocatingly great, but also an impeccable visual treat to die for.

The story seems done before, and the different parts feel far-fetched. There was a more profound concept regarding being a prisoner physically and philosophically, which I think executed well, but it could have used some polishing. It's a good movie in every field, but that's about it - it's forgettable.",
1177,19 January 2022,lokikap,9, A great movie with an interesting ending,"""Prisoners,"" directed by Denis Villeneuve. ""A man who has lost everything is capable of anything."" ""Prisoners"" is one of the best, if not the best, crime thriller of the century. An incredibly well-made film that almost instantly hooks you in your chair. Denis Villeneuve is one of the best directors of this generation, and his work in ""Prisoners"" is fantastic, you can see how passionate he is about his work. Everything, and I really mean everything, is well thought out and well put together. Roger Deakins again impresses with his camerawork. There is literally not a single frame that I would change. The acting is from another world. Hugh Jackman is top notch, the range of this man in this film is incredible and shows how talented he is. I don't think I have much to say about Gyllenhaal because he's unbelievable as hell in every movie he makes, but here he was especially good. Viola Davis and Maria Bello were great and played the roles of desperate and hopeless mothers so well. The biggest surprise in this movie was Paul Dano. The man knows how to act! The Prisoners is a gripping crime story. It has a lot of foreshadowing and deep symbolism. Every line and every shot is important to the story, and that's what makes the film so great. It is very unpredictable, which is perfect for a crime film/thriller. It's a masterpiece, and it's Villeneuve's work at his best. One of the best films of the 10's and my second favorite Denis film, only after Blade Runner 2049.",
1178,19 January 2022,dashaelaginavr,9, Prisoners of War movie review,"The psychological thriller is one of the most popular genres ""among the people"", the advantage of which is that you can make something more out of it if you want to. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (his previous film, ""Fires"", is in the top 250 of the main film portal of the planet IMDb) is trying to do with a script by Aaron Guzikowski (""Contraband"") exactly that - add a second bottom to the crime story and if possible hide it deeper to the output to get a little philosophical parable about good, evil, faith and, in our time without it, internal demons and what feeds them. There is no doubt that Prisoners of War was originally a purely genre thriller - it's such a solid, but a little ""twisted"" detective story in the spirit of the late nineties. Even in terms of technology and technology the plot seems stuck somewhere around the turn of the century: on the one hand, there's the almighty computers storing complete text archives of every ""sneeze"" in the area for decades, on the other - the awkward neglect of the ability to track the character's movements, say, by his cell phone. However, even with these flaws, the intrigue is wrapped up quite nicely - all the pieces of the puzzle will add up for attentive viewers not long before the characters hit their stride.",

The acting, from everyone is amazing, even some of the side characters, but Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal give the types of performances you barely ever see, in the best way possible. On top of that, the cinematography is excellent, some shots in this film are so mesmerising and good looking. As for the story, its excellently done. This is the type of film that if you don't pay attention to a large portion of the dialogue, then later events and moments in the film will make much less sense.

Acting is amazing with such a great cast and the story line is disturbing but really done well.. I recommend this movie to everyone it always seems to be one that I'm shocked not many people know about.. it is hard to watch them go thru a horrible situation with the kids and I can't even imagine what that would feel like but you really feel hugh Hackman's emotions he does it so well and his acting in this movie should be talked about more! Everything you want in a thriller is in this movie which is always very rare which is why every now and then I always come back to it and I'm never disappointed!,
