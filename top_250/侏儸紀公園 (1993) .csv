0,10 June 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,10, A rare breed of film seldom seen anymore: a true masterpiece.,"'Jurassic Park (1993)' is a landmark achievement, in as many ways as possible. While some of the exclusively digital dinosaurs don't hold up quite as well as the rest (despite having been only relatively recently surpassed by their peers - depending on budgetary constraints, of course), there are times when the superb CG almost seamlessly blends with possibly the best practical effects I've ever seen to create phenomenally believable, groundbreaking special-effects that truly are, still to this day, some of the best of their kind. Seriously, both the Raptor rigs and, specifically, the to-scale T-Rex are nothing short of breathtaking. They work so well not only due to the flick's fantastic technical prowess but also thanks to its beautiful blending of its core techniques (those created by clay and those by computer), its legitimate reactions from the compelling characters and its uncanny ability to put the audience right in the middle of it all, making you feel genuine wonder, fear, suspense and elation as if you're really sat alongside these long-extinct creatures. It's difficult to stress just how important the characters are in making it all so utterly believable, as well as so utterly captivating. Each of them feel like fleshed-out people, written to perfection by screenwriters who know how to get information across to the audience in a very organic way. It's almost as entertaining watching these people just converse with one another, discussing the morals of bringing extinct creatures back from the dead, as it is seeing them navigate the survival situation in which they are inevitably placed. It is only because we care so much about all the core players that the suspense sequences work so well, that we are kept on the edge of our seat every time a dinosaur lurks around the corner and that we grip our chairs when they leap for their prey. These scenes are some of the best in cinema, perfectly constructed with restraint and splendour. It's also difficult to describe how affecting even the simple moments can be, the moments in which we are asked to sit back and stare at the mere sight of a dinosaur. These should have dampened with time and yet they haven't, still eliciting the awe they did when they first hit the big-screen. They emulate the imagined magic of seeing one of these animals in real life for the first time. Running underneath all of this are some compelling themes that eagerly invite analysis, with the central debate being a tough and intriguing one. The picture is simply one of the most engaging I've ever seen, one that puts an ear-to-ear smile on your face just because it's so utterly amazing. It balances all of its core tenants impeccably, being a proper 'summer blockbuster' that's incredibly intelligent as well, to the point that every second is just supreme entertainment. It can make you lean forward in your seat or well-up with awe and, in general, have a blast from beginning to end. The movie is, without a doubt, a true masterpiece. 10/10",/
1,11 May 2013,planktonrules,9," With a bazillion other reviews, I'll keep this short.","By now there are nearly a thousand (not really a bazillion) reviews for this Steven Spielberg film. So, in the case of mega-hits where there is a strong consensus that the movie is exceptional (and I don't disagree), what more is there to say?! Apart from a few characters who seemed a bit one-dimensional (which is a minor problem in an action film) and the unwritten Spielberg rule that kids cannot die (taking away much of the suspense), the film is amazing. While the CGI isn't quite as beautiful as what we can do today, it STILL looks awesome. With only a few exceptions, the dinosaurs LOOK real! And, the music from John Williams is, as expected, very good. Overall, a highly entertaining film which will no doubt please everyone except for the impossible to please.",r
2,18 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,9, A time when I thought dinosaurs were real,"My first epic movie to see on the big screen was Jurassic Park. I was only 8 years old and I had no idea what I was in for when I watched this movie. I was terrified but so enchanted by this world. Steven Spielberg brought back the dinosaur genre, a genre that was only used with caveman movies. Not to mention did it with incredible special effects. I remember seeing this movie for the first time and asked my mom if the dinosaurs were real or if they made giant robots. Those dinosaurs not only looked real but were absolutely terrifying. But what an adventure we took with Jurassic Park, the land where anything could happen with a crazy billionaire and upset employees who pretty much destroy the world for a nickel. One of the most memorable movies of all time that still holds up to this day, Jurassic Park is a film not to be missed.",e

I think most people remember when they saw this movie first, because it was that awe inspiring of an experience. I remember that it was the first pg-13 movie I was allowed to watch, and what a way to start my grown up movie experience!!!
Everything in this movie screams adventure, from the opening scene where the jungle leaves rustle, the shot of mysterious sparkling amber, to the landing of the helicopter on a remote rainforest island, the movie sets the tone for the greatest adventure movie ever made. As you hear John Williams glorious theme start to swell, and you see Alan remove his glasses and start to tremble, you know you're about to witness one of the most magical moments ever put on cinema. I can't go into detail on all the incredible scenes, from the T-Rex reveal, to the kitchen scene, but each one of them revolutionized what we thought movie magic could take us. Thank you Spielberg for making this enchanting piece of art for us, an entire generation is indebted to you.",w
7,30 March 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9," Dazzling spectacle, with the dinosaurs as the scene-stealers","I personally really like Steven Spielberg, and I like his films, especially Schindlers List, Jaws and ET:The Extra Terrestrial. While a tad too long and has one or two loose ends in the plot, Jurassic Park nevertheless has thrilling action and has sheer evidence of the director's vision and effortless verve at work. John Williams's score is absolutely terrific, definitely one of the more memorable scores in a Steven Spielberg movie, the score for Jaws like Psycho is one of the main reason why I am so scared to go into the sea now. The acting is really not bad at all, Sam Neill and Laura Dern have given better performances but they were good. Jeff Goldblum is terrific, and as Dennis Nedry Wayne Knight is suitably more subdued. Richard Attenborough, a talented actor and a even more talented director also is good as John Hammond, while child star Joseph Mazello, who surprised me in Shadowlands is appealing as Tim. However, the real stars are the dinosaurs, especially the T-Rex, the mix of computer animation and models is inspiring. The cinematography is astounding, the script is good and the direction is lively. I haven't read Michael Crichton's book, but regardless this is a hugely enjoyable film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/

9,28 June 2017,Tweekums,10, Still great after almost a quarter of a century,"After a worker is killed in an accident at the dinosaur theme park 'Jurassic Park' owner John Hammond calls in experts Dr Alan Grant and Dr Ellie Sattler as well as mathematician Ian Malcolm to visit it the park and clear it to open to the public. 'Jurassic Park' is no ordinary theme park; it is on a remote island off the coast of Costa Rica and it contains real dinosaurs! It is explained how these have been created by extracting dinosaur DNA from blood in mosquitoes preserved in amber. The first ones the visitors see are harmless herbivores but they are told that the park also contains some of the most famous carnivores such as Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor; something that both excites and concerns the scientists. After an introduction the visitors, along with Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim, and the company lawyer take part in a tour of the park. As they travel things go wrong for two reasons; a tropical storm is heading for the island and, more importantly, a corrupt company employee as set up a computer program that will turn off various security systems including the electric fences that protect the guests so he can attempt to steal dinosaur DNA sell it to a competitor. Once things do go wrong those on the tour find themselves fleeing for their lives following a T Rex attack on their vehicles while those at the park headquarters try to find a way to get the systems working again. Inevitably not everybody will get out alive.",w
10,25 April 2012,Leofwine_draca,10, Classic for a reason,"I'm no great fan of Steven Spielberg. He makes films that should interest me, but all too often ruins the experience by being overly sentimental. Take his WAR OF THE WORLDS remake as a case in point: it had the potential to be a fantastic movie, but thanks to the ridiculous plot twists I can't ever bring myself to watch it again. However, JURASSIC PARK, despite containing an overload of sentimentality, manages to be a simply great movie, a classic in fact, thanks to an overwhelming amount of elements that work.",1
11,27 March 2017,AlsExGal,8, A milestone in its time,"The biggest attraction of this film back in 1993, of course, was the realistic computer graphic animation of the dinosaurs by SGI coupled with the realistic sound effects and the good use of suspense built around them both.",0

These put other screen dinosaurs to shame.,0

If I remember correctly, it was also a big thing when it came out. I even had a backpack with a Velociraptor head sticking out of it for school. It was such an amazing achievement as a movie itself and the film is so wonderfully done that there's no doubt of why it has held up as long as it has and will remain the best dinosaur film ever created.",8

16,28 September 2018,sophiebrooks-75145,9, Such a classic.,"This movie is definitely one to remember. Despite being filmed in the 90s, Jurassic Park continues to be a classic to this day. 
Watching the movie now highlights the contrast between the effects then and the special effects available now. This, along with some acting that is a tad overdone, are the only real critiques I would give this film. 
The child actors were especially hilarious to me-the young boy, Timmy, has moments that really capture a reaction that a child in real life would have (""I threw up."" ""Well that's ok! That happens sometimes""-Allen-is one of my favorite quotes). 
Another extremely influential aspect of this film is the music that plays over certain intense scenes and the iconic theme music in the opening/closing. The music combined with the diegetic sound of the dinosaur stomping/approaching builds the suspense and creates an intense tension in the audience. 
As a classic worldwide, it's no wonder that this movie provided the basis for generations of movies to follow.",2

When his spectacular action-adventure Jurassic Park was first released in 1993, he left critics, film buffs, casual viewers, parents and children equally spellbound. Twenty years later, the film has been re-released in both 3D and IMAX, allowing a new generation to experience the magic, and old fans the chance to relive it again.",/

21,26 February 2004,stephie-12,10, Groundbreaking!,"This was obviously the most sophisticated portrayal of dinosaurs at the time, and it doesn't age a bit.  Sam Neill plays Dr Alan Grant, a paleontologist who is persuaded to check out Richard Attenborough's new theme park, only to find that he has managed to clone dinosaurs.  There is plenty of action, and the dinos look so real as to be positively scary!  Sam Neill puts in his usual incredibly brilliant performance, and you can really believe he is acting with the creatures!  Jeff Goldblum as usual seems to play himself, as Professor Ian Malcolm, an expert in chaos theory who is convinced the park is a bad idea.

26,19 December 2013,rahmannoodles22,10, Welcome to Jurassic Park.... Noodles Review,"Look up the word ""awe"" in the dictionary... ya know what you'll find? Jurassic Park. And now in 3D! Usually, I don't really like post- converted 3D in movies, but this one won me over. Ever since I was a little kid, I've always loved Jurassic Park (I think we all did) and I'd always heard that it was one of the best movie theater experiences ever. Unfortunately, I wasn't born when this originally came out so I never got the chance to experience that... until now! And damn, were they right when they said it was an awesome movie theater experience because it sure as hell is. It's so fun, engrossing, and thrilling to watch it on the big screen, with all the sound surrounding you (the sound in Jurassic Park has got to be some of the best sound in a movie ever). Jurassic Park is also one of the most monumental movies of all time. It defined CGI. The CGI and special effects in this movie still holdup today and are even better than most movies today.",_
27,4 October 2005,STACorpus,10, incredible movie,"Even though it was adapted from a book, this unique story was destined to become an incredible film. Great casting, decent acting, great special effects, beautiful and perfect score by John Williams, incredible directing. I believe this movie has to be one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Although not entirely true to the book, (though someone should never say a movie is not good because it is not exactly like the book because that really doesn't matter) Steven Spielberg made this story a landmark in special effects and a standard for thriller films to be compared to. It also contains some scenes that are instant classics, such as the first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the scene where the T-Rex chases the jeep. I will keep this movie in my list of favorites and classics till the day i die.",u
28,6 April 2013,ironhorse_iv,9," Hold on to your butts, it's now in 3D. Jurassic Park is Rex!","I don't really like paying for movie tickets just to watch old movies converted into 3D. I can watch the 2D version at home, with no cost. Still, Jurassic Park is one of those movies. No matter, if you watch it in 3D or 2D, your jaw will dropped seeing the realistic lifelike dinosaurs on screen. I had watch this movie over and over again over the years, and it always is a blast to watch. In my opinion, it's one of the best movies of the 1990's. Jurassic Park is the story of a theme park on a tropical island near Costa Rica, populated with cloned dinosaurs that turn amok, and those left on the island, must find a way to escape. Jurassic Park shows the potential danger of technology. Owner John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) spared no expense making this park, but in an attempt to increase efficiency and save money, wants Jurassic Park to be able to operate with a minimal number of staff run by weasel Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) and Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson). Therefore, he has the park designed to be operated almost entirely by a huge computer system that automates virtually all of the park's systems and functions. What he doesn't know is that Dennis Nedry, has been paid off by one of InGen's corporate rivals to steal dinosaur embryos. During the theft, Nedry deactivates the park's security system to allow him access to the embryo storage room. Jurassic Park was written by Michael Crichton in 1990, the beginning of the information age, where everything was getting computerizing, but few knew the dangers of it. People are still suffering from computer theft even today. Another danger of technology is how men shouldn't play God by cloning extinct animals. The movie mirrors the lesson teach in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Still the science in the film might be far-fetch. The idea of bringing dinosaurs to life after 65 million years is unlikely even with future technology. Soft tissues that contain DNA are nearly impossible to preserve and the chances of extracting enough DNA of a single dinosaur to produce one are slim. Still, it's interesting. If it does happen, you know that chaos will come close in hand. This serves as an example, where technology fails to keep us save, and prove disastrous. Still the movie fails to explain why Hammond didn't use all the staff that he has. They were paid to be there, so when the hurricane comes to the island. Surprising the film footage of the storm was Hurricane Iniki that hit Hawaii where they were filming. So that was really a hurricane that being shown there. Anyways it would make sense to have the staff there to make sure the island is secure, but he send them off the island for something that was a merely a small storm, keeping only two computer guys and a game hunter? What? The movie would be a little bit more interesting if only we, the audience got to see the whole staff in danger as well, like Michael Crichton earlier novel, 'Westworld' that has a similar plot. Instead we only see a small group of dinosaur experts try to escape the island rather than a whole island in chaos. This small group is leaded by paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern). Harrison Ford was first ask, but he turned down the role of Dr. Alan Grant as people might mistake the character for Indiana Jones. In my opinion, Sam Neill was perfect for the role. They are joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim Murphy (Joseph Mazzello). The kids are bit annoying as they do idiotic stuff or have stupid dialogue. Most of the movie, I really wanted them to get eaten by a dinosaur. It make sense for all those characters to be in the island, except Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), a mathematician that the lawyer brought in. While Jeff Goldblum is given some of the best lines in the film; the reason why his character is there is still a question to me. He doesn't know anything about dinosaurs. Still, I do like his flirting with Chaos Theory. The movie differs from the book in a bit. I'm glad Steven Spielberg took out the Hupia theme from the story. It wasn't needed. Different characters end up dying, while other characters that supposedly died in the book, live in the film version. Surprising the whole character of Tina was written out of the film. The film has amazing visual and special effects by the use of animatronics. The film is noted as one of the first movies to use CGI. Director Steven Spielberg was worried that computer graphics might look like 8 bit type cartoon quality but upon seeing ILM's demo animation of dinosaurs. He decided to shoot nearly all the dinosaur scenes using this method. In my opinion, the stop motion they did film wasn't too bad as well. The early CGI, this film use is surprising is better than a lot of modern day CGI that low budget companies use. Jurassic Park's soundtrack compost by John Williams is truly anthem of our childhood. The music is spectacular. Not a lot of people know this, but while Steven Spielberg work on Schindler's List, he placed post-production in the hands of George Lucas. In many ways, you can see Luca's influence in the film. It was while supervising post-production on this film that George Lucas decided that technology was good enough to begin work on the Star Wars prequels. The movie is a must- see movie, not only if you love dinosaurs, but also if you love Sci-Fiction. Give it a try if you haven't saw it already. An adventure 65 million years in the making is waiting for you.",r
29,26 August 2013,OlieRendch,10," A milestone in cinematic history, a huge achievement in CGI effects, and by the most well-known director in the world.","Jurassic Park. An island full of dinosaurs who terrorise people; a simple premise but extremely well done. From beginning to end this film is just an enjoyable watch. Back in 1993 when it was released these never-before-seen effects had to have wowed audiences, and even now it still holds up with the anamatronics, CGI combo, it is really good; I've seen worst stuff in other movies and TV series. The characters I thought were pretty well done and acted, you really didn't want certain things happen to certain people and I really like Sam Neil as Alan Grant. Now, I was really exited to watch my favourite film on the big screen and especially in 3D, I watched it in IMAX as well, something I had never done before, and boy did it deliver. The 3D in this movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, better than Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 by far. Jurassic Park in the third dimension brought a whole new life too it, just some of the scenes with the trees, and leaves and then an awesome scene in the kitchen was good in 3D. So yes, I think Jurassic Park will continue being my favoured film for a long time to come.",v
30,8 June 2005,Pythonman,9," As said, the Definitive blockbuster movie","What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? Who knows. We all know that this has some of the greatest special effects, even today. Also, if there's anything that can match the awesome T-Rex, it's the movie's musical score.

I saw this movie when it came out in theaters back in 1993; I was only 9-years-old and, though some scenes scared the crap out of me, it blew me away. I was amazed at how, for the first time in a movie, I felt like I was watching REAL dinosaurs.

32,27 June 2022,xiaoli7377,10, One of Spielberg's Finest,"Up there with""Jaws"", ""E. T."", and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" as one of the quintessential Spielberg popcorn flicks. Although I doubt there are people who've yet to watch it or at who are least familiar with its effect on pop culture, ""Jurassic Park"" is one of those movies that completely captivates and hits the nail on the head in every sequence. Unlike its myriad of sequels and spin-offs, what Spielberg does with the original is craft a Hitchcock-esque thriller that happens to have great special effects that hold up nearly thirty years later. Even sequences that would be mundane in most other action movies, like a Ford Explorer sliding down a tree and chasing the main characters, is exciting. I give a lot of this credit to the original score by John Williams.",

I think that it's fitting that the movie was released in 1993. With baby boomer Bill Clinton now in the White House, it was clearly a new era, and this movie looked like it was representing a new era - think of it as being 1961, with young John Kennedy as the new president (which it would have been for my parents)*. The fact that Steven Spielberg also released ""Schindler's List"" that year and won two Oscars for it backs up this aspect.",

38,21 June 1999,master of the obvious,9, Brilliant,"What can I say? Jurassic Park is one of the most underrated movies ever. Yes, I did say underrated. True, it is the fourth highest grossing movie ever (for the time being) and was a motion picture bible for eight-year-olds across the country, but it has never been regarded as artistically superior. When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It contains all of Spielberg's magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful camera techniques to astounding technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over technology). The minor flaws of a theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc. and the acting is superb. This is one of the only movies I've seen with great acting by children. Spielberg's camera usage ranges from foreshadowing the appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles to exquisitely composed scenes of the dinosaurs' ""interaction"" with the characters. Aside from technical quality, Jurassic Park bears powerful social messages of human intrusion and destruction of natural environment and the self-revering nature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema being one of the first movies to use CGI at such a large scale. However, the most ingenious aspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times throughout the movie, the humans are portrayed as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of the dinosaurs is wonderfully developed. And, best of all, like star wars you can analyze the movie all you want or just sit back and enjoy the ride.",

There were rumors that the park was in serious trouble, so the owner John Hammond decides to get a dinosaur expert, paleobotanist, a scientist, a lawyer, and his grandchildren to endorse the park. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs are free from their domains after the power went out. Now everybody must have their survival instincts in hand. The acting is very good. I Liked Sam Neill as Alan Grant. The special effects were amazing. The dinosaurs are pretty darn perfect. The sound effects are excellent as well. I really loved the music in this film. John Williams did such a fantastic job with this score and themes. Overall, this is must-see movie. I rate this movie 10/10.",

44,8 June 2022,aidanratesmovies,9, Where were you when you first saw Jurassic Park?,"A thrilling and ambitious journey, Jurassic Park can suffer from a handful of formulaic tendencies- but that doesn't stop the film from its incredibly fun ideas and worthwhile execution. First off, the cast is just so well done in the film- from Laura Dern to Sam Neill to Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough- everyone just gives it their absolute all and it just works so well. The plot is simple, and at times a bit predictable- dinosaurs coming back to reality is always a fun idea however so thankfully to its execution it never feels bogged down too much narratively. I wasn't a huge fan of the kid characters throughout, the actors did fine, but I couldn't help but feel they were all but unnecessary- and only a plot device to see Neill's character grow. The special effects were of course brilliant at the time and mostly hold up rather well today. I love the combination of CGI and animatronic and feel it never surpassed the grand ideas this film had in terms of that collaboration in the future. The score is absolutely excellent, of course its iconic, but even lesser known tracks just flow so well throughout the film. In the end, Jurassic Park has some minor flaws here and there but is mostly a fun and solid little adventure flick that for once deserves the hype.",

The books became huge hits when Universal bought the rights from Michael Crichton three years before the movie came out, months before Spielberg's academy award winning movie, Schindler's List, came out. I was too young to see this movie as I was only 10 years old and dad was undecided on if I'd like it or not due to the pg-13 rating. I grew up being fascinated with dinosaurs after seeing exhibits about them and seeing them in cartoons and playing with them as toys as in Dino Riders. When i finally saw the movie on vhs more than a year after it was in theaters (dad saw it in Wayne Preakness, one of the few theaters that showed it in DTS 5.1, with my stepmom kathy two years before they got married), i loved it!! I saw it a few more times then bought the movie on tape at now gone Suncoast and I still have that tape somewhere lol. The CGI still stands the test of time nearly 25 years after it came out and the action is nonstop yet it drags a bit. The sequel that followed it, The lost world, i saw twice, first with my family and the second one with a group of boys and girls club teens and thought it was the best jurassic sequel. Jurassic Park III was the weakest in the franchise until Jurassic World became a humongous hit. Hopefully fallen kingdom is ok....",

56,18 June 2015,Leporinum,10, Unlike anything the world had ever seen before.,This movie was released during my childhood while I was already a dinosaur enthusiast. I saw it 2 times at the cinema and as far as I can remember these were the only 2 times I ever saw an audience applaud at the end. It made an big impression. Computer generated images were new at that time and we didn't know what to expect. But I think I can speak for everyone if I say we were blown away. The dinosaurs looked so real. And even in the years after that computer generated images in other movies were just not as good and realistic as in Jurassic Park.,
57,23 July 2019,blackwidowis7cool,10, Instant Classic,"John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) creates this park called ""Jurassic Park"" where he recreates the dinosaurs using DNA found in fossils (but also having to use frog DNA to complete it - don't ask me why, I don't quite remember all the technical stuff).
But before Hammond can open it to the public, he has to get it approved. So, he hires some fossil finders (played by Sam Neill and Laura Dern) to go to the park and look through it without telling them what occupies the park. Anyway, they go there and Hammond gets them to take his grandchildren along after the fossil finders express concern about the park's safety with the dinosaurs. A hippie scientist-type guy Dr. Ian Malcolm (played by the great Jeff Goldblum) also accompanies them as well as a lawyer.
That's where things start to go wrong. The dinosaurs escape. I won't say anymore, though.
I loved it! I think it is one of the greatest films of all time and is certainly a classic. I don't understand why everyone thinks this film is scary. It's not - apart from a couple scenes like the start and something later on. A lot of film writers should watch this and take notes on how to do tension as this film has brilliant tension.
It has quite a good sense of humour, and ""Jurassic Park"" is generally suitable for children, though you might want to fast forward the very start and maybe one or two other scenes, but generally, I think that children can watch it, though it depends on the individual child and what they can or can't handle.
Another brilliant subplot in the film is with Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and his dislike for children. During most of the danger, he is stuck with Hammond's grandchildren. There is great chemistry between him and the children.
Jurassic Park is a brilliant movie.
Hats off to you, Mr Spielberg!",

Richard Attenborough(RIP) play John Hammond, owner of Ingen and creator of Jurassic park. He is a very great actor (and director). He don't play John Hammond, for everybody who love cinema, he is John Hammond. And Sam Neil, what can i say about him ? Simply he is one genius. He is at the best with playing Alan Grant. For some people, he became just one role. Watching him in another program, i am sur that somebody would automatically said : it's the guy from Jurassic Park, Doctor Grant !

Except the dinosaur parts since it just didn't meet my prospect of things when it comes to a entertaining movie when I was a kid. But watching it now, I can really appreciate this movie and what it does. In fact it's one of the best dinosaur or some creatures that attack people type of movies I have ever seen. I recently saw this movie in theaters in 3D and it still meets even today's standards when it comes to great movies. Steven Spielberg is a visionary director and he really put everything he had into this movie. The CGI still holds up but what amazes me is how they used animatronic dinosaurs for the dinosaur scenes. This movie came out in 1993 and even the cinematography still hold up. The characters are well grafted into the story and stands out despite the two annoying kids. Even if it does have slightly cliché moments with one of the character predicting all the outcome but most of the people just won't listen to the guy scenarios. But then again this movie came out in 1993. The build up is just fantastic in this movie and although a bit far-fetched the way it's shown makes it believable, like everything in this movie is possible. The plot is about a rich old guy that decides use his money to clone dinosaurs and make a dino theme park but things just doesn't go according to plan. And it really does seem like a real theme park, mainly because of all the small details and effort that is put in the settings and backgrounds. Even the freaking theme song is so darn catchy and memorable. Go watch this movie in theaters now! It's what movie going experience is all about.",

75,23 September 2015,christophershobris,10, This is How You Do It,What an impact this film has had and still has. Never before have we seen dinosaurs on the screen in this magnitude. Even today nothing and nobody has done to dinosaurs what this film has done a film that unlike Jaws were not necessarily terrified to go into the water or in this case a zoo. With this we feel awed like we are looking over the Grand Canyon when we first see Jurassic Park. When I go to watch I don't just watch it for the casual sake of doing so because when I watch this it is an unbelievable and exhilarating experience that can appeal to the likes of anybody with a pulse. Another stand out is John Williams outstanding score that will be listened to for years to come even after 20 years it still holds up and that is the magic of Steven Spielberg as only he can bring us such a one of a kind experience and a film that gives a reason why we love films in the first place. The only negative I would have to say is the performance by Ariana Richards as Lex and Bob Peck performance is a bit overdone. Other then that this is a near perfect film. Now to grade.

76,14 June 2015,moviemattb,10, This Classic 22 Year Old Movie Is Still Awesome!,"""Jurassic Park"" has been around for twenty two years, and it has been one of those movies that has always been part of my childhood and it is definitely one of my all time favorite movies. This is the best of best, because none of the sequels lived up to the original. So the story is about an old man name John Hammond, who invites three doctors alongside with a lawyer to show them that dinosaurs are alive and real, and shows them how they were actually created after they were extinct sixty five million years ago (If anyone knows math on what I just typed). So he sets up a tour for them, but things go haywire as dinosaurs start to break loose when the power goes out during the storm, and it is a chance for our main characters to survive and to get off an island that is filled with dinosaurs. I did not see on the big screen back in 1993, but only saw it on home video. However, I was able to have the opportunity to see it on the big screen, but only this time in 3D as it came out back in 2013 for honoring the film's twentieth anniversary and I really had a blast to see it like I never had before. I love this movie, and it just never ages for me. To me, it feels timeless as if this movie was made today or any other time that was made. Of course, this movie was famous for its use of groundbreaking digital technology, and I know many filmmakers when nuts about this and it does upset many people that they choose to use CGI over practical effects. Although not many filmmakers overuse CGI as they decide to remain old school, but still use CGI if its done right. With that said, I thought it had a very good story from beginning to end as you first introduce the characters, then you show the island and how it went wrong, and you see how these characters are able to survive. The characters are very good, and likable at the same time. Sam Neill; Jeff Goldblum; Laura Dern and Richard Attenborough all gave out such terrific performances on their own; they may not be three dimensional, but there is still enough characterization in the movie and still to care about. The two child actors all did great too. The movie is filled with wonders, excitements and having some pretty good actions. Steven Spielberg has made such beautiful looking movie, and knows how to make a movie about how much we like about dinosaurs. John Williams' music is so darn memorable, and it is completely unforgettable. The special effects done by Stan Winston Studios and Industrial Light & Magic are top notch perfect for the use of practical and CGI effects. They continue to look impressive as I watch it, and it never feels dated for my own personal taste. If I had to pick what is my favorite dinosaur, I would say the T-Rex which it is obvious that everyone loves the T- Rex. I do love the scene where we first meet T-Rex as it has perfect build up that is perfectly suspense, and it is perfectly well edited together. Heck, the movie doesn't bored me and it was always keeps my interest. The ending that everyone remembers when the T- Rex saves Dr. Grant and the others by Raptors was awesome. I do love how the movie ends, where they finally go home in a helicopter and it gives you that good feeling as Williams' music plays along as the movie ends. I love ""Jurassic Park"" so much, and this classic twenty two year old movie is still awesome! I give it a perfect 10 out of 10.",

The scenes put chills through the viewer with how powerful they are. The only downfall to the movie is the CGi scenes. For it's day the CGI was amazing and even today, it isn't over the top bad or super cringe worthy, but it is noticeable. The cinematography is breath taking and the acting and lines are all good. A must see for any movie lover.",
90,10 July 2022,kevin_robbins,10, There's nothing not to love about this movie.,Jurassic Park (1993) is a movie in my DVD collection that my daughter and I recently rewatched together on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a pair of archeologists brought in to see the world's first ever man made dinosaurs created from fossilized DNA of prehistoric dinosaurs. The financial backer of the science wants to create a theme park for the dinosaurs for people to see his creations. As the scientists partake in the first dry run of the park they quickly discover dinosaurs cannot be contained so easily...,

93,11 December 2001,smashattack,10, Almost perfect.,"Jurassic Park really is 65 million years in the making. I mean, wow. I have never seen a movie that combines action/adventure, intellectuality, in-depth characters, excellent storyline, great graphics, and perhaps one of the best soundtracks ever made (John Williams, of course) in one movie.  How the makers of this movie fit all this really baffles me. What else really amazes me is how close the movie was to the book (especially compared to other books made into movies by Crichton).  Don't let that statement fool you; Jurassic Park the movie is nowhere near the book, but the essential parts have not been ripped out of the book (like all of Crichton's books). Michael Crichton, John Williams, and Steven Spielberg--what an excellent combination!  Crichton wrote the awesome book (and the screenplay for the movie, too, I think), Williams composed and conducted some of the best contemporary/thriller music ever made, and Spielberg made the frightening dinosaurs so much more freaky. The only thing wrong with it was that it wasn't as close to the book as I'd hoped, although, like I said earlier, it maintained the essential parts, which is unusual in Crichton's book-to-movie transformations.  The book explained things a lot better and I could really connect with the book a little better.  I can connect with the movie, too, it's just that I needed to watch it several times before I understood exactly how everything happened the way it did. Watch this movie.  It has hardly any disappointment in it, if any.",

99,24 October 2015,bheadher,9, What can you say about one of the most brilliant films ever.,"When I sat down in the theater seat I had no idea what to expect. I hadn't seen a big screen movie in a long time, but I'm glad I saw this one the first time there. I'd have to say Jurassic Park was brilliantly executed from start to finish, with absolutely outstanding CGI blended in with some very stunning acting. I'm kind of a science follower anyway, so when they incorporated some sound scientific elements into the story, it sort of added to an almost perfect story. Don't believe you could ""genetically engineer some dinosaurs??? While there are two conflicted camps in the Genetics realm, there is generally agreement that it is possible. It would simply be very difficult to create the right genetic conditions, then you wouldn't quite know what you had until the animal hatched. So yes, the apparent ease of manipulation you see in Jurassic Park is a bit over the top, which is one of the reasons I only gave it a 9. The other reason is that about half the dinosaurs depicted in the movie were from totally different time periods. The Brachiosaurus is about the only truly large dinosaur that was firmly entrenched in the Jurassic period. There were a couple other plant eaters that were really huge also, but no large carnivores. The majority in the movie belonged in the Cretaceuos period.",

The direction of the story is executed so well, that you don't care of the minor flaws. The visual effects, over 20 years later still looks better than most stuff today. This is becuase of the anachronistic used in close up shots and cgi used in wide shots or over the head shots. Any time the camera was placed far away from the dinasor was CGI. The two blend well together, givin this sense of disbelief.",

Soon we see a group of scientists head to Isla Nublar including paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), his paleobotanist colleague Ellie Satler (Laura Dern), and mathematician Ian Malcolm (a fast- talking, vintage Jeff Goldblum), a chaos theorist who recognizes that knowledge without discipline equals disaster. Of course he's right, and the park's maiden tour turns into a nightmare for the visitors, who include Hammond's two precocious grandchildren. Compounding this mayhem is the park's systems-control expert, who plots to sell dinosaur DNA to a rival corporation, and must sabotage park security to carry out his scheme. When a tropical storm threatens the island, our unscrupulous employee seizes the opportunity, leaving the billion-dollar attractions to roam free, as all hell breaks loose.

It was a flea circus...Petticoat Lane. It was quite spectacular. Spared no expense. There was a miniature merry-go-round and a wee trapeze and a car-carousel... and a see-saw. They all moved, motorised of course, but people would say they could see the fleas. ""Oh, I can see the fleas, mummy, can't you see the fleas?"" Clown fleas and high-wire fleas and fleas on parade.

How do you express that this movie is still extraordinary and entertaining while also admitting it's not very deep concerning story and characters? (Although I liked the characters). Should I admit that the ending, with the rex sneaking into the building somehow and eating the raptors, is imperfect? How'd it get in? Does it matter? Was seeing the rex one last time worth it, as Spielberg thought? Spielberg was, at any rate, at fine form here, with such great detail packed into the film.

Looking back last night, the dinosaurs made by those stunts are still very, very cute, and the image of free walking in the primitive forest living freely is popular. This led me to be more familiar and familiar with the animals 60 million years ago than many animals that still exist today. At the tension of the plot, the brutal shot also scared me to blindfold. There are few loopholes.
One of the most interesting discoveries is that in this film, due to the high development of technology and the extensive use of computer special effects, Spielberg has questioned modern science through the genetic engineering of dinosaurs: can science make humans think they are the world The master of can control nature and transcend nature? Of course, the answer given by the director is no. It can be seen that this reflects the modern West's understanding of the limitations of science after introspection of science since the 20th century. Science cannot be an excuse for human arrogance. However, this does not affect the greatness of science. After all, because of the development of science, Spielberg can create, we can see the image of a dinosaur living freely in nature 60 million years ago.",
125,2 January 2001,jhclues,10, The Genius And Vision Of Spielberg,"It's indeed rare when a movie comes along that is so special, and has such a tremendous impact on audiences of all ages, that when it happens, it's an occasion for celebration; which is exactly what Steven Spielberg gave the world with `Jurassic Park,' a film that made the impossible possible:  It enabled dinosaurs to walk among us.  He put these monsters from a bygone era on the screen for all to see, and the unique thing about it was that they were real; so real you could reach out and touch them it seemed.  And in doing so he touched the imaginations of every child who sat there in the dark of a theater and watched his creations come to life, and he touched the child that still resides within every adult who came to see his show as well.  Jaded moviegoers and those who affect cynicism as a mission statement of life may scoff, especially now, after some time has passed and the magic has worn off somewhat, but it doesn't alter the fact that with this movie, Spielberg surpassed any and all standards of the cinematic world and set the precedent for all that would follow.  To borrow a line from one of his own characters, he `Spared no expense,' and simply made one of the most exciting and memorable films in the history of the Silver Screen. 	Spielberg pulled out all the stops to make this remarkable film, and it goes without saying that the special F/X are incredible; what's easy to overlook amid all the spectacle of it, however, are the performances turned in by one and all, and most notably by Jeff Goldblum, who brings such nuance and style to the role of Dr. Ian Malcolm.  It's a supporting role into which he immersed himself to create one of the more memorable characters in the film, and his performance-- with the countenance and attitude he lends to Malcolm, even the commanding, mesmerizing way he speaks-- has never received the attention it so richly deserved.  Nor has the performance of Richard Attenborough, as John Hammond, the entrepreneur who makes Jurassic Park a reality.  He's such a gifted performer that he makes you forget he's acting; Hammond becomes real, which makes what he's doing real, and it's just another example of the many things that add up to make this such an incredible movie.  Spielberg and his cast and crew have given such care to detail that it, in effect, releases the viewer from the baggage of even having to suspend disbelief because they're given a world that is `real' from the ground up.  The result of using all of the magic available, and using it wisely. 	Also turning in outstanding-- and entirely believable performances-- are Sam Neill, as Dr. Alan Grant, and Laura Dern, as Dr. Ellie Sattler, each creating figures central to the plot and around whom much of the action revolves.  And there are a number of performances in supporting roles that are just too good to go unmentioned as well,  including Bob Peck, as Muldoon, the park's head gamekeeper; Martin Ferrero, as the `blood-sucking' lawyer, Donald Gennaro; Wayne Knight, as computer hacker Dennis Nedry; Samuel L. Jackson, as computer programmer Ray Arnold; and last, but not least, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards as Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, through whose eyes the child in all of us vicariously experiences the wonders of Jurassic Park. 	The wonderful thing about a movie like `Jurassic Park' is that, not only will it forever remain as a testimonial to a filmmaker of genius and vision, but that it will be there for all the generations that follow to discover anew.  The world may change drastically around us, even from one day to the next, but as long as even a single spark of imagination survives, one thing will always remain constant:  The fascination by children of all ages for these legendary beasts that once ruled the earth.  And that is why, when all is said and done and the skeptics have become no more than shadows and dust, this film-- as well as Steven Spielberg-- will remain a cause for celebration.  This is the legacy, and the true magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",

Every second on Isla Nublar is a reminder of nature's majesty and mystery that got me labeled ""the animal fact kid"" as a grade schooler. Not even just the dinosaurs, the lush, tropical greenery set against that epic, rousing score gets my attention and awe the moment Hammond's helicopter arrives on Nublar. The beauty of what Hammond and InGen have created is so hypnotizing, it's incredibly easy to forget their failures. Even its scenes of gruesome violence and death have an odd primal allure to them, the spell remaining unbroken. Those failures aren't what cynics and detractors of the franchise as a whole will tell you; the sheer act of creating dinosaurs wasn't Hammond's mistake. It was treating nature as entertainment.",
147,24 February 2006,Hitchcoc,9, One of Those Moments,"There are a handful of movies that absolutely grab a person. The case I had on jury duty had been settled out of court and so I had an afternoon to see a movie. This is the one. I had anticipated it for so long and was ready for the disappointment that usually follows. It didn't happen. From the moment that Richard Attenborough says, ""Welcome to Jurassic Park,"" I was hooked. And when the Brachiosaurs come lumbering across the grassy park, I was stunned. I know that since that time, computer generated special effects have become regular fair, but this was amazing. The other part of it, however, is that this a masterful story with a great deal of complexity (chaos theory, etc.). The people are interesting; the villain foolish and in over his head. Then there is wonderful set up of a park that is foolproof, suddenly losing its security. I don't normally like child actors, but the two in this express the terror that they indeed should. Some films hammer one with so many images; this one still relies on the greatest method of scaring people. It's not what you see; it's what you don't see. It's what's lurking in the bushes. The other thing is that the characters are on the playing field of their adversaries. Kowledgeable as they are, they are not in their own world. Those veloceraptors are a nice touch. As I was growing up, enamored with dinosaurs like most kids, I had never even heard of these creatures. Granted some of the threat is orchestrated, the scene in the kitchen is as frightening as anything I've ever seen",

Anyhow, I managed to get scared out of my wits within the first 10 minutes. Long story short, Jurassic Park was one of the movies my mom would never let me watch as a kid. So it kind of sucked, me ""playing the home game"" while the other kids talked about how amazing Jurassic Park was (ah! I miss the grade school days). I miraculously managed to not have the movie spoiled (or not to remember having it spoiled).

Every horror film has them. ""JP"" has its share of bad acting, bad scripting, and even less-than-competent directing, but the truth is this. People love the book as a classic.

My ultimate favorite scene is the dilophosaurus scene with Dennis Nedry; minutely minimal in gore but still everlastingly, horrifically frightening. The only nitpick I have is that the climax (when the velociraptor pack attack them in the guest center building and then suddenly a T-Rex storms in) is heavily predictable, inconsistent to the prior buildup of suspense and dread in the rest of the film.

Its not just about having big scary monsters stomping around, Jurassic Park gives the dinosaurs a transfixing majesty and wonder that its sequels would fail to grasp. This film goes beyond being just another monster movie, with more character and more heart than any others in the genre, dealing with themes of ambition and the consequences of playing God with nature.

I saw the film and enjoyed the scariness a lot. Then after that several times whole school with teachers went to see the film and whole family went to see the film. And remained in my memory as an unforgettable event. Now whenever I see this film on my DVD with a lot of clarity and surround sound it still gives me the same enjoyment and thrill as it gave me when for the first time I saw it.

160,16 April 2013,talarisw,10, Dinosaurs and humans collide in Steven Spielberg's classic about a billionaire who opens an amusement park where he brought back to life Dinosaurs!,"Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all time and is the king of Hollywood blockbusters and this is one of his greatest movies. What I love about Spielberg is how he's always thinking outside the box and doing things nobody else has and in result he had made one ground breaking movie after another making other similarly themed films look absolute in comparison. I mean only Spielberg would have the for-site to license the Jurrassic Park book by Micheal Crichton even before he finished writing it and long before it was released because he saw the movie potential. Before I get to the Dinosaurs let me talk about everything else. First I must praise Micheal Crichton for his brilliant concept. The story gives a plausible(granted not realistic) explanation to how people could resurrect Dinosaurs. The movie starts off strong as in a classic horror movie fashion we get a glimpse of a dinosaur, a Velociraptor attacks a human but we never see the Raptor it self. With a movie like this you expect the first fifteen minutes or so to be exposition and set-up and you expect that we have to wait awhile until we some Dinosaours. Well, all that's true but it's not a problem because Spielberg keeps the pace moving so nicely, it's never boring or slow. Spielberg just gives enough exposition that he needs to give, a old billionaire named John Hammond has a park with real life Dinosaurs and to please a lawyer who represents his sponsors he persuades two archaeologist and a scientist to come along to check it out and give their approval and our story begins. As great as the special effects are you need a great story and great human characters. The story is simple but well done, it makes a ludicrous premise of Dinosaurs being brought back from the dead into 1993 believable and that's because the movie takes it self seriously it's never comes off campy or ironic. The story is similar to Frankenstein as they show what happens when ""man"" play God. I like all the characters here. Richard Attenburrough is perfect as John, the old man who created the amusement park. I like that they never make him a bad guy or even crazy just misguided and you even feel bad for him when his amusement park dosen't go the way he hoped. The more or less hero of the story is Alan Grant played by Sam Neil, an up-tight archaeologist who dosen't like kids but later does after protecting John's grandkids from Dinosaurs, nothing really deep but a good fit for this story. In fact none of the characters are really deep but still strong characters capable of holding this movie. I like Laura Dern as Ellie, Alan's partner who's tough and fearless. Wayne Knight gives a memorable performance as the double crossing Dennis, who is the only true villain. Samuel L. Jackson is also good as one of the guys who operate the park. My favorite character might be Dr. Ian Malcolm played by Jeff Goldblum. I like how John described him as a ""rock star"" with his shades and leather jacket. It's hard to explain but Jeff is just so appealing and he brings some humor to the movie. I also really like Bob Peck as the expert hunter Rob Muldon, he's like the Van Henlson to Dinosaurs. I like his rivalry with Raptors and I feel bad when he's killed by one of them, I wish he would of came back for a sequel. But the best thing are the dinosaurs themselves. The special effects are amazing, especially for 1993. The Dinosaurs look real and I don't mean real looking for a movie I mean they look like their really alive. Nothing mechanical or cgi looking about them. The special effects are groundbreaking and some of the best in movie history. First we see the Brachiosaurs, which looks great as well as seeing a Triceatops which looked all too real. but the real moment comes when we see the most iconic Dinosaur of them all the Trannosaurus Rex, who emerges after the power goes out and Ian, Alan and the kids are stuck in a car in front of the T-Rex cage and it attacks the kids in the car. The special effects on the T-Rex looks frighteningly real and I love it's roar. Later the T-Rex chases Ellie, Rob, and Ian in a car which was also great. I also love the Dilophosaurs who attacks Dennis, I love how it's like a rattle snake but unfortunately the real Dinosaur dosen't have the neck fan or shot venom, that was created by Crichton but this is way better. The best Dinosaurs are the Velociraptors, no one even heard of them until this movie. That's one of the great things about this movie is that they introduced us to some lesser known Dinos. I understand for theatrics Spielberg had to make the Raptors more menacing then they really were but he did a great job at making the Dinosaurs be animals acting by instant not monsters. I love how intelligent they made the Raptors. The Raptors are my favorite Dinosaurs in this movie and they steal the show. Although the ending was a little contrived when the T-Rex came out of no where to save ""our heroes"" from three Raptors, two of which some how escaped a locked room but it made for a good climax any way. I also love the score by the great John Williams. The is def-intently the greatest Dinosaur movie of all time.",

In fact, the ground-breaking CGI work used here to bring dinosaurs to life before our eyes is still very impressive over twenty years after its release, so you can only imagine the impact that they had back in the day. Truthfully, the effects work is by far the most impressive thing about this one, as it has a fairly by-the-numbers story-line populated with clichéd characters. A select group of people are invited to an island retreat owned by a millionaire who has been able to recreate living dinosaurs from ancient DNA.

The title represents the old and the new where Richard Attenborough establishes a theme park where dinosaurs roam wild thanks to cloning prehistoric D.N.A. He brings in a research team, most of whom will become lunch to creatures unimagined. Inappropriate marketing to families featuring frightening and graphic scenes. Great concept with heart pounding suspense and a triumphant climax. The cast mainly play out characters whom are nothing more than what's on the menu. Sam Neill is strong in his position of protecting two children as well as present narrative insight. Laura Dern plays the second smartest character in her search and rescue attempts as well as struggle with the power. Jeff Goldblum as a mathematician is given funny lines but illogical decisions that land him an injury. Attenborough's theme park owner is a joke and really needs heavy medicine and psychiatry. Wayne Knight plays a villain who makes a failed attempt to steal the DNA. Spielberg created broader characters in Jaws, however this still remains a landmark film that excels in brilliant technical advancement. Score: 8 ½ / 10",

It was also the best movie ever, Having advanced CGI, animatronics, etc. back then, There are sequels to this movie I thought were also great, even if the other fans didn't like it. The sound effects are really life like. The dinosaurs even had most of their behavior almost accurate. I love how the scientists are attempting to bring back dinosaurs in the franchise. Best movie series ever. :)",

And forget about a plot summary. If you're not familiar with the plot of Jurassic Park, stop reading my drivel and go check it out right now. As my rating clearly indicates, I love this film. The word ""classic"" gets thrown around too easily when describing movies. But here it's deserved. Jurassic Park truly is a modern classic. It's family/action/popcorn filmmaking at its finest. It's hard to believe that Jurassic Park is almost 25 years old. I remember seeing it in the theaters and being completely blown away by the special effects. They were simply stunning. More amazingly, however, is how well the effects hold-up. I hadn't seen it in several years, but I watched it the other night with my 5 year-old. This was a first time viewing for him and I'm happy to say he's now a fan. When the first dinosaurs came on screen, I could see he was filled with the same excitement and amazement that I was in 1993. The CGI here is as good as any movie I've ever seen. While CGI may have become more common, I think filmmakers have gotten lazy. In too many modern movies, the CGI is obviously CGI. Here, everything looks ""real"". They took the time and spent the money to get it right. And the mix of computer effects with puppetry is pretty much seamless. I may not care for everything he's made, but I'll give Steven Spielberg credit here. He took an unbelievable premise and turned it into a very believable world. Jurassic Park is pure movie magic.",

192,20 August 2008,Robert_duder,10, The quintessential Dinosaur movie will likely never be topped,"It's true that few people can create a visual story and spectacle like Stephen Spielberg. I can almost remember seeing Jurassic Park as a kid in the movie theatre for the first time and if you asked me then if I liked it I probably would have told you that it was the greatest movie I had ever seen and meant it. Years later, seeing it again, it has perhaps some of that youthful exuberance I once felt for it but that doesn't make it any less powerful and brilliant and wonderfully created. I think just seeing the film outside of a movie theatre takes away some of the magic because the dinosaurs just aren't as enormous and terrifying and jaw dropping as they are on a 200 foot movie screen. Still I did pick Jurassic Park to be the first movie I watched on my beloved new 42 Inch Plasma which helped a great deal. The characters are intricately created and you become enthralled in their adventure. Spielberg has always had a way of making characters come to life and you become completely attached to them which makes the story even better. On top of that Jurassic Park coins the thrill a minute phrase giving you a non stop jaw dropping riveting story about action and danger and of course dinosaurs of all kinds. The film is just quite simply a modern day classic. One of my favourite scenes in movie history is the scene with the Tyrannasaurus Rex attacking the jeep for the first time with Tim trapped inside. That scene has stayed with me for years along with the Raptors in the kitchen later on in the film. The movie is not soft enough for really little kids but it's not too edgy for the pre-teen/teen crowd but definitely edgy and intelligent enough for any adult or movie lover to watch again and again.",

All of the performances are top-notch, the score by John Williams is timeless, the CGI is phenomenal for its time, and the expert blend between that and the utterly breathtaking practical animatronic effects mean that the dinosaurs are as convincing today as they were in '93. On top of that the film is endlessly quotable, and in equal parts awe-inspiring, laugh-out-loud funny, genuinely tense, and a constantly entertaining thrill-ride.

The dinosaurs are quite breathtaking CGI creations, and more than that, they are menacing at all the right times. The dinosaur attacks are very well done with Spielberg not relying on music (sort of the opposite of 'Jaws') and instead dead silence to render the attacks frightening. Spielberg throws a lot of neat directing tricks in the mix too, such as extreme close-ups on Samuel L. Jackson's technician and decent doses of humour, like an 'objects in mirror are closer than they appear' warning visible as a dinosaur roars into an automobile side mirror. Not so successful are the film's attempts to drill home messages such as the risks of tampering with nature, all spelled out through character dialogue. The way the child-hating Sam Neill eventually learns to bond with kids is also so forced and obvious from early on that it never really works despite a credible turn from Ariana Richards as a surrogate daughter of sorts. In fact, the film is very well acted overall, give or take Wayne Knight's inappropriately comical performance as the closest the film has a human antagonist. The strongest of the cast is Jeff Goldblum as a mathematician who finds himself often talking to himself, but Jackson, Neill and Richard Attenborough as the amusement park owner have their strong moments too.",

206,24 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,10, Jurassic Park may just be the quintessential blockbuster.,"Folks, they do not come better than this. This was the game changer. The pinnacle of entertainment for future Hollywood blockbusters. Spielberg crafted what is now one of the most quotable, memorable and revolutionary films of all time. You cannot deny the staying power that Jurassic Park has. A group of scientists are invited to an island theme park where dinosaurs have been genetically modified and cloned. A storm approaches, one employee decides to steal and in doing so shuts down the park's computer security systems. You know what that means...enter the Tyrannosaurus Rex! Everyone has pretty much seen this, there really is nothing I can add to the appeal. It's a perfectly structured narrative where the first half builds the characters (in order to prevent them from being just expendable assets) which leads to a thrilling second half where they must escape. One scene turns the film from a family adventure to a terrifying thriller, the T-Rex. It's sheer animatronic perfection. The stature, the colossal size and detailed craft creates a magnitude of awe. Quite literally blown away when it roars through your sound system, it gets me every time. The visual effects were revolutionary and would provide a bench mark for future films. The acting was solid all round, Sam Neill and Laura Dern's chemistry felt natural. Jeff Goldblum is a marvel and Richard Attenborough is Jurassic Park, wouldn't be the same without him. Spielberg's electrifying direction comes to no surprise for anyone. He is the ultimate ""event director"". Dinosaur POV shots to tracking shots outside the jeeps He really does know how to conjure up a magical adventure, always has done. Bear in mind this is a PG, some of the scenes actually scarred me as a child. The T-Rex casually devouring a lawyer and the velociraptor grotesquely ravaging an innocent. Some would say Jurassic Park is the definitive blockbuster, to which I agree. Jurassic Park...""Welcome, to the perfect rating club""!

The action doesn't even start until an hour of viewing. But what follows is absolutely terrific. It scares you at times when dinos pop out of nowhere and it is one f/x movie that people really liked. Most movies of this kind (Independence Day, Godzilla, Armageddon, etc. Which I liked ALL of) are movies that don't really please like this movie. It's got really smart action sequences and fairly good acting but I think they should have used more popular stars, but you mostly concentrate on the dinosaurs, which do good acting jobs. I thought they would have been nominated for Best Actresses. The f/x are another thing. They look really good! Only if the first half was more exciting but oh well. The rest of the movie makes up for that mistake. That leaves one more thing. The sequel. I thought the sequel was top notch. It was even better than this movie. In my opinion, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is just slightly better than the first because it starts out with more action. That's unlikely for sequels. Watch them both. They will be remembered for generations. Until they become extinct. Or when the next blockbuster hits with great f/x and good script. Crowd-pleaser's are so hard to find these days, aren't they?",

Some of the scenes where DNA sequences are manipulated have turned into true modern science. Our expectations are more than was delivered in the special effects but it was nostalgic to catch glimpses of these young stars, especially a very young Samuel Jackson. The movie is about the ultimate theme park composed of Dinosaurs but oh no suddenly something goes wrong.

The fact that I was already interested in Dinosaurs made the film even more of a holy grail. Jurassic Park was the film that dreams were made of for yours truly, and despite my massively over-inflated expectations - the film really DID deliver. I saw it in cinema several times, and, at the time, couldn't ever see anything topping Jurassic Park. Of course, this was just the simple view of a child and, having seen many other films by now, as well as several subsequent viewings of this one; it's clear that this isn't the film that I once thought it was. But don't get me wrong - the fact that I now understand that films do indeed get better than this don't mean that Jurassic Park isn't a brilliantly well sculpted piece of entertainment. The plot is taken from the Michael Crichton book of the same title, and follows a new theme park, where the attractions are Dinosaurs. We follow a group made up of palaeontologists, other experts and the owner's children as they visit the park. Naturally, everything goes wrong and the lot of them are thrust into the world of the dinosaurs! ",

"" Yet it took two exceptional directors, Steven Spielberg and George Lucus, to bring this imaginative story to life. The movie concerns an eccentric Billionaire named John Hammond, ( Richard Attenborough) who decides to buy an island off the coast of Costa Rico and build a huge enclosure for recreated Dinosaurs. When it's finished he invites the foremost authorities to endorse his park which include Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), a Palo-botanist, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) a Chaos Theorist. The Zoo which Hammond creates for his attractions is a gigantic and impressive enclosure surrounded by electrified fences, automatic controls and computer protected alarms. So safe is the public that Hammond also invites his grand children. (Tim Murphy and Ariana Richards) However, no sooner does the grand opening tour begins, when things begin to malfunction. This sabotage is programed by one of the employees who is set to make a fortune by betraying his employer. The animals getting free is bad enough, but the terrifying ordeal has just begun, when the worst of the dinosaurs, the T-Rex is also set free. Horror gives way to terror when the children are preyed upon in the jungle tour, but they also have to race about in the open park, with all sorts of hungry creatures awaiting them. The movie is filled with frightening and terrifying scenes and only the screams of the audience is left within the walls of the theater. Samuel L.

216,13 November 2005,PWNYCNY,10, Science+Profit = Trouble,"When I first watched this movie years ago, I didn't like it. I thought the movie was one big special-effects extravaganza with theatrical and uninspiring acting (except, of course, in the scene with the lawyer sitting on the toilet who's gobbled up by an out-of-control and hungry Tyrannosaurus Rex. I don't know if that scene was meant to be funny, but I recall that it provoked a certain amount of laughter.) Subsequently, I didn't give this movie a second thought. Then recently I happened to be watching television and lo-and-behold I switched to a channel that just happened to be showing Jurassic Park. So I watched the movie and this time I liked it. Indeed I thought this movie was great, and I'll tell you why. Despite the overblown special effects and contrived script and the almost laughable acting, especially by ""Newman"" from Jerry Seinfeld in one of the worst cases of miscasting in the history of movie making, this movie successfully and effectively deals with a serious theme - what happens when highly sensitive, highly experimental and potentially lethal scientific knowledge and technology gets into the hands of people who want to exploit this knowledge and technology for profit. This movie shows how the technology of cloning, when used irresponsibly and with little of any thought for possible consequences, can produce disastrous results, in this case, dinosaurs running amok with no way to control them. It seems far-fetched, but really no more so than the possibility of people being able to fly or communicate electronically over huge distances. It only seems far-fetched until it becomes a reality and then it's like it was always meant to be. But getting back to this movie, now that the dinosaurs are unleashed, the question is: how can they be controlled? They were supposed to be placed on display in a park, but it doesn't quite work out the way it was intended. Instead of the dinosaurs being confined, they literally go on a rampage, completely trash the park and in the process reveal a level of intelligence and cunning that is entirely unexpected, with dire consequences. The raptors, for instance, are not mere reptilian brutes but rather are cunning and highly intelligent creatures which makes them even more dangerous. And the humans who unleashed these creatures are simply no match for the ferociousness and strength of creatures that are now beyond all control. Compared to the dinosaurs the humans puny and helpless bystanders who are literally running for their lives when not caught and devoured. The humans' weapons are absolutely no match for the ferociousness of these creatures, who easily overpower and out-think the humans. The movie ends with the surviving humans getting out while they can, leaving the dinosaurs in charge of the park. Now, what happens if the dinosaurs escape from the park? Could the human species survive?",

As you hear John Williams glorious theme start to swell, and you see Alan remove his glasses and start to tremble, you know you're about to witness one of the most magical moments ever put on cinema. I can't go into detail on all the incredible scenes, from the T-Rex reveal, to the kitchen scene, but each one of them revolutionized what we thought movie magic could take us. Thank you Spielberg for making this enchanting piece of art for us, an entire generation is indebted to you.",

232,13 June 2020,fernandoschiavi,9," JP is a production with undeniable predicates, a blockbuster with content, based on the work of a best-selling writer who never offended the intelligence of his readers","The adaptation for the big screen was made by David Koepp with the collaboration of Michael Crichton himself. Koepp left out much of the exposure of romance and violence and made numerous changes to the characters. Filming took place in California and Hawaii. Some differences between the book and the film, for example, are that in the original script, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) were combined into a single character, and Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck) survived in the end. In the book, Gennaro and Muldoon survive, and John Hammond and Malcolm die. Despite these differences, the adaptation managed to capture the essence of the original work and Spielberg seems to have been the right director for the job, considering the filmmaker's ability to move between so many genres of the seventh art, always leaving his mark. In Jurassic Park, the director gets it right when delivering a science fiction that brings an exciting adventure, with many touches of comedy (personified mainly in the character of Ian Malcolm) and, at the same time, having all the foundation on the basis of a suspense very well built through a somewhat claustrophobic environment giving the impression that the characters were in fact at risk of life because they were in an isolated place and surrounded by imposing and hungry dinosaurs. Most of the scenes filmed at night and in the rain, make everything even more threatening, increasing even more the suspense of ""where will the next attack come from? "". The film manages to leave everyone watching it on the edge of the chair all the time. Another curiosity is that with more than two hours in duration, Jurassic Park has only 15 minutes of filming with ""real"" dinosaurs, nine minutes from Stan Winston's animatronics and six minutes through CGI (Computer Graphics).",

For many that movie experience will come at a young age and in a dark theatre where the large screen envelops you in a whole new world you never thought possible. For me, like many of my generation, that film was Jurassic Park. Of course I liked many movies before that point but it opened my eyes to the potential of the medium like no other film, before or since. Scorsese talks about the religious-like experience cinema can create in its audience and watching Spielberg's classic for the first time I can fully appreciate what he means.

Steven Spielberg's popcorn masterpiece has a number of sequels at this point but nothing even comes close to the original. It's scary, funny, smart and action packed. It's nearly flawless in every way from the perfect performances pretty much all around except for some questionable moments from Dern. The movie's spectacular effects also hold up surprisingly well.

This science-fiction adventure based on Michael Crichton's novel exhibits the absorbing talent of the influential filmmaker. In short words, this film is an eye-catcher in both its story and state-of-the-art special effects. Clashing together the prehistoric age with the present, this movie drops its character in the blistering heat of a battle against dinosaurs, who are polished with one of the most eye-popping computer-generated imagery ever put to screen; effects that still hold up to this day. But whether or not the film is faithful to Crichton's source material is not wired to my knowledge. It is terrifying adventure, but is one that manages to bring on the thrills and tension that make it a wild ride for the whole family. That is if the children can handle the immense scare factor of the giant dinosaurs causing mayhem. This movie stars Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, a biologist who opens up wild attraction on a remote island known as Jurassic Park where dinosaurs are brought to life by genetic engineering. Coming along for the ride is writer Grant (played by Sam Neill), his partner Ellie (played by Laura Dern), animal biologist Dr. Ian Malcolm (played by Jeff Goldblum), and Hammond's grandchildren Timmy (played by Joseph Mazello) and Lex (played by Ariana Richards). When the tour around the park goes awry and dinosaurs become hostile, the group along with several other tourists are pitted in a terrifying fight for survival.",

258,1 June 2006,Hellrazr360,9, Hold On To Your Butts,"Jurassic Park is one of the films I just couldn't stop watching when I was younger. Although I used to watch it just for the roar of the T-Rex, the movie was still a perfect way for me to kill two hours on those boring Sundays I still deal with. While the idea of a movie that has the plot of ""resurrecting"" dinosaurs, the movie does an excellent job in making the plot believable and actually made me think: ""If we had the right preparations, could we create dinosaurs?"" It sounds crazy, but the movie really gets you thinking that after the easy-to-follow description of how they brought back the extinct lizards. As a movie directed by Steven Speilburg, the least one could've expected when watching a movie like this for the first time would be excellent CGI, and let me tell you, this looks better than many movies of today, and it's over twelve years older than them. Not only do the dinosaurs look astounding and believable, but the action they're put in (along with the actors) is equally satisfying and thanks to all-around great acting performances, there's plenty of well-done suspense throughout the film as well. But one of the many parts of this movie that immediately made me dig it was the music. The theme music in this film isn't only instantly recognizable, but it's also unforgettable and always a joy to listen to when watching a movie as fun and thrilling as this. While Speilburg has made (and still does make) some disappointing flicks he's still one of the top directors in my eyes and this one in particular stands out as a big hallmark. If you're looking for real entertainment that's larger than life, look no further than this thrill ride through the jungle.",

265,11 January 2014,tbills2,9, Welcome to Jurassic Park,"I remember first seeing Jurassic Park in the movie theater alongside my family as a young kid. I remember us having very close front row seats probably because we didn't get there early enough and the theater was packed. The movie begins rolling and I'm watching the movie and I'm enjoying it and I'm enjoying myself and it's a really good movie! But then when the scene with the T-Rex comes up, you know, that scene where the T-Rex escapes through the fencing of his no longer electric, electric cage........I got so scared during that scene! I was so frightened that I had to excuse myself out of my front row seat, walk all the way down the aisle, out of the theater into the lobby, acting like I was just leaving to go use the restroom. Yeah, right, I picked the moment smack dab square in the middle of the very best part of the whole movie to just go leave and use the restroom. Who was I fooling? I didn't have to go pee. I was terrified! I probably almost peed my pants! The T-Rex looked so real, and felt so real! It sounded real too! I know though that I at least made it through to the part where the massive T-Rex starts spinning the kids' vehicle with his huge snout, with the kids trapped inside it, but once the T-Rex started stomping their SUV, crushing the kids underneath, all while letting out a spine tingling and ferocious roar.....I was out of there, and in a hurry! I went and hung around in the restroom for a little bit, not really doing much. When I got back to my seat in the theater, it was at the time when the T-Rex is chasing Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum in their speeding away vehicle, where Goldblum is laying on the back of the jeep, all too injured to move but not too hurt to punch out a few wisecracks, and then the T-Rex explodes out of the trees and is right on their tail! I thought that I might have to go to the restroom again.

It is not the greatest movie ever made, but it was THE groundbreaking movie on the 1990s on the special effects front. This was the first mass-marketed, studio produced movie to use computer generated creatures, creatures who were seamlessly inserted into a live action movie. Special effects we take for granted now were pioneered by Steven Spielberg and his crew of special effect artists in Jurassic Park. The movie requires fantastic special effects, the story based on the Michael Crichton book by the same name about genetic engineers bringing dinosaurs back to life 65 million years after they died out. The story is pretty much the standard scary creature movie, as the dinosaurs chase people, eat people, scare people, but is still entertaining through the effort of Spielberg. The tension created through the various scenes in the movie and the real-life quality of the dinosaurs. Herky-jerky, fake dinosaurs would not be real-enough for the audiences, diminishing the tension that is created by dinosaurs chasing the characters in the movie.

Sam Neil and Laura Dern are a wonderful couple, but the real stars of course are the dinosaurs. The explanation of their cloning is told very convincingly, albeit not without some infallibles. Am I to believe that the DNAs from the fifty odd dinosaurs that appear in the whole trilogy all came from one drop of blood in one mosquito ?

I thought they were great sequels to a successful franchise and for a grade, I would give The Lost World and Jurassic World both a 9.5/10. However, I'm not really a huge fan of Jurassic Park III, but it's ok and i'd probably give it a 7.0/10.

Give it a watch and I promise you will not be let down. Jurassic Park (1993) gets a 10/10 for me and that is a hard rating to come by.,

The only small flaw I have with the film is adults do stupid things like leave the children alone and other moments like that. Overall it's a classic action film of the 90's.,

The film was ambitious and ensured special effects would leap forward. The film has dated, but nothing a modern revision wouldn't correct if the filmmakers wanted, I hope not though.

289,17 August 2000,chrisbrown6453,9, Now this is my kind of amusement park!,"Titanic, shmitanic, Jurassic Park is definitely atop my long list of favorite movies.  Not very often is a movie made that has such an impact on the people that are lucky enough to see it.  Jurassic Park leaves such an impression on the viewer, that when I watched it on opening day, after standing in line for a (still current) record of 3 1/2 hours, I stepped out of the theater, turned around, bought another ticket, and watched it again. Jurassic Park transports the viewer to the ancient world of dinosaurs. While watching this film, I couldn't help but wonder where they got all the dinosaurs to make it.  Well, of course there are no dinosaurs today, it was just the master work of good pal George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic team. While the special effects were cutting edge, the story was even more revolutionary, a completely original idea of bringing dinosaurs into todays world. Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) is called upon by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to analyze his new ""amusement park"".  Joined by Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), Grant tours the park meeting all type of dino's along the way. As the trip's energy begins to die down, so did the electrical fencing holding the dinosaurs in their bins.  The greatest scene in the movie has a T-Rex eating a lawyer, and then tearing apart a sport utility vehicle. The realism is indescribable, which is precisely why I advise everyone to go and rent this movie.",

The first time I thought it was okay, but after the second view, I realized...NOT!  Spielberg and the rest of the production team have taken an interesting Crichton novel and made a terrible film with many changes, not all for the best.  The special effects and the ""island"" are great, as is Laura Dern's bottom (to summarize an earlier review), but the rest was just...there.  Too bad, too, because they waste some great actors, notably Sam Neill (who does deliver one of the most convincing lines I've ever seen, as ""Karen Davis"" notes).  Like ""Independence Day"", this could have been a great film, but falls far short of expectations, and could have used a better continuity editor.  The sequel is TERRIBLE.  ""The Lost World"" is a more enjoyable alternative.",

I myself was a toddler so I grew up watching it on VHS, DVD and so on. As a kid I pretty much watched it for the Dinosaurs. I mean come on who didn't like dinosaurs when they were kids?

295,11 May 1999,PIST-OFF,9, You can bet Jurassic's good!,"I love Jurassic Park. Most people complain about the acting. I thought the acting was adequete. Like a lot of people I usually don't like big budget computer graphics movies. This is an exception. Most people hate the plot. I thought it passed for good. Jurassic Park is a really great movie. I saw it more times in the theater then any other movie ever. Seven in all. It can be watched and enjoyed on the small screen but much like Star Wars, Pink Flyod's The Wall, and Saving Private Ryan it can only fully be appreciated on the big big screen. The special effects in this movie may never be equalled. Sure it's standard monster movie stuff but who's kidding who here. What is the main reason to see the movie. If you don't like the rest do something better yourself. Me I give it a 9 out of ten rating. Watch it with Godzilla (1954) for added fun.",
296,12 September 2001,Platypus82,10, Absolutely fantastic piece of moviemaking,"Okay, after writing reviews on The Lost World and JP3, and ranting and raving about just how awfully bad these movies are, especially compared to the prequel, finally I'll tell you just WHAT's so great about this movie. It's got everything. Yes, it has the, at the time spectacular and totally new dinosaur effects- but it also has great dialogue (bits of Malcolm's chaos theory strewn in without getting too scientific for a mainstream cinema audience- if you want the hardcore stuff, read Crichton's book-, Malcolm's sarcastic remarks), an INTERESTING STORY (it's the general idea of man trying control nature which goes wrong, but there are those subplots of Grant and children, Grant and technology, some rivalry between Malcolm and Grant, Hammond's not the greedy, nasty guy from the book [which is why he gets eaten in the book] but just an idealist trying to make his dream come true, and so on...), great music- it's just perfect. I've watched this film over and over and I love it every time. Someone reviewing TLW cleverly remarked that Jurassic Park has its fair share of plot holes too, only nobody seems to criticize them. Jurassic Park does have a fair share of ""flubs"" (there's a whole website dedicated to listing them), starting with the cliff that appears where the Rex paddock should have been, but also equipment seen in the background, crew seen in the background, robotic arms just disappearing, towels that suddenly change color, the emergency bunker directly next to the raptor paddock and so on and so on and so on. But these are not ""plot holes"", they're continuity issues, and sometimes smaller flaws of logic. ""The Lost World"", while I don't know how many of these smaller mistakes it has, already shows how acting, character development, dialogue and especially story move into the background and emphasis is on more dinosaur effects, more intense action scenes and mroe spectacular shots of people getting eaten, accompanied by a hearty ""CRUNCH"" of course. The first time I watched it, just after having seen JP3 I actually liked it, the second time I was more sceptical. There's a lot copied from JP (or Godzilla, or Hatari), and just about everything else is pretty stupid. (Hammond wants to show people dinosaurs for money, so for safety reasons he does this on a remote island with all sorts of security measures. Still, the project fails and the creatures break out and eat people. Now they have the brilliant idea of TAKING DINOSAURS ON THE AMERICAN MAINLAND to show them for money!!) And JP3 is merely a waste of time and money. It's got dinosaur effects and it's got action scenes but it's, if I may quote a newspaper critic, ""nothing but a slasher move, albeit with nonhuman villains"". Some STILL like this, say things like ""Gimme more dinos!"" or ""TLW didn't have enough blood and guts"" but this is what was so great about the first movie. It's got the effects PLUS characters you can identify with (in the sequels you don't give a damn who gets eaten. They could have eaten Goldblum's daughter for all I would have cared) PLUS an exciting storyline PLUS good dialogues PLUS the best soundtrack I've ever heard! But with a franchise like this they just can't help but squeeze money out of it until it's dead...",
297,15 May 2008,bobsgrock,8, A well-made thrill ride with dinosaurs.,"Of course they were going to make a movie based one this book, and of course Steven Spielberg, the king of the box office, was going to direct it. It did happen and the result is a spectacular vision of what dinosaurs really might have looked like when they lived on Earth. Of course, with Spielberg at the helm and ILM doing the special effects, everything here looks stunning, even by today's standards. The action sequences are very well-shot and the suspense hangs over us for the better part of the second half of the movie. The biggest flaw here is the human characters. They aren't developed nearly as much as they should be and only the Jeff Goldblum character is interesting at all. Still, we really aren't supposed to get close to these characters, just sit back and watch dinosaurs try to kill them. For film nerds, there is plenty to dissect and critique. For the average movie lover, this is simply a well-made thrill ride.. with dinosaurs.",

A Dr. Ian Malcolm, (Richard Attenborough) meets up with this couple and suggests they visit his theme park which has great surprises for these people who are so interested in the study of dinosaur's. As soon as Dr. Alan and Dr. Ellie realize that this theme park has actual living dinosaur's, they are both delighted and learn that he is cloning them for his theme park and how Dr. Ian intends to display all these creatures for the general public and other scientists who want to enjoy his great accomplishments. However, things get a bit out of control and that is when this film becomes a complete horror you will never forget. Enjoy.",

300,16 March 2005,jboothmillard,9, Jurassic Park,"Directed by Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), this film, along with Terminator 2, set the standard for advances in special effects, and it was a favourite film for me growing up, still is, based on the novel by Michael Crichton. Basically palaeontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) are renowned for studying dinosaur bones, and are invited by the founder and CEO of bio-engineering company InGen, John Hammond (Lord Sir Richard Attenborough) to visit, certify and endorse the opening of his newly created theme park on Isla Nublar, an isolated Costa Rican island. Also invited are mathematician and chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), the guests enter Jurassic Park, and are stunned by the sight of a living breathing dinosaur, a Brachiosaurus, plus two others and a herd of Parasaurolophus in the distance. Hammond takes them to the visitor centre where a laboratory tour explains that dinosaur DNA was extracted from the bodies of mosquitoes found trapped in hardened tree sap, called amber, and the incomplete DNA strains had sequences gaps filled by frog DNA, and to prevent breeding all dinosaurs have been engineered to be female, despite being initially stunned some of the guests question the ethics of bringing extinct (by selection) creatures back to life. The group are joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Tim (Joseph Mazzello and Lex Murphy (Ariana Richards), children being his target audience, to take the tour of Jurassic Park, with Hammond and his team watching from the control room, but it does not go to plan, as dinosaurs including the Dilophosaurus not appearing, and getting out of the controlled Explorer cars they find a sick Triceratops. It gets worse when a tropical storm has been reported as heading for the island, computer programmer Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) uses this opportunity, he has been bribed by a corporate rival to steal dinosaur embryos, he deactivates security systems to gain access to them and escape, in doing this the guests in the cars come to a stop, and fences are failing all over the park. This leads to this escape of the most dangerous of the dinosaurs in Jurassic Psrk, the Tyranosaurus Rex, Gennaro is devoured, Malcolm is badly injured, and Tim is pushed off the embankment whilst in the car into a tree, but he and Lex are safe and rescued, and they and Grant climb into another tree to hide until the morning, Nedry meanwhile trying to get to the dock is killed by the Dilophosaurus, and the embryos he collected are lost in the mud. Sattler and game warden Robert Muldoon (Edge of Darkness's Bob Peck) search for the survivors, only finding Malcolm alive, they narrowly an attack by the T. Rex, during the night Grant and the children get close to a herd of Brachiosaurus, and as morning comes they come across broken shells of hatched dinosaur eggs, Grant concludes that the frogs used to complete DNA sequences must have been West African bullfrogs, which have been known to change sex in a single-sex environment, allowing them to breed. While the three of them encounter a herd of Gallimimus, and avoid the T. Rex again, Hammond insists that to get security and communication systems working again they should reboot the system, reluctant chief engineer Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson) agrees, and it does work, he heads for the maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. Arnold does not return after some time, so Sattler and Muldoon head out, they find that the shutdown has allowed the escape of the other dangerous dinosaurs, the Velociraptors, Sattler makes it to the shed and using walkie talkie communicates with Hammond and Malcolm to reactivate the power systems, unaware that Grant and the children are climbing an electrocuted fence. Sattler discovers Arnold's severed arm and escapes an attack from a raptor in the shed, Muldoon is killed in a raptor ambush, and Grant and the children make it back to the visitor centre, Grant goes to search for the others, leaving the children inside, but they have two Velociraptors searching for them. Grant, Sattler and the children go the control room, and Lex being a computer hacker is able to restore full power, allowing the group to call for help, they are cornered by two raptors, but escape when the Tyrannosaurus suddenly appears to kill both raptors. In the end Grant voices his intent not to endorse the park, Hammond concurs this decision, and all the survivors board the rescue helicopter and leave the island. Also starring BD Wong as Henry Wu (he returned in Jurassic World), Gerald R. Molen as Gerry Harding, Miguel Sandoval as Juanito Rostagno and Cameron Thor as Lewis Dodgson. The acting is fine by all the actors in it, but the real stars are of course the dinosaurs, brought to life by both brilliant CGI special effects and models, the story is simple and the action is exciting, and the script is well written when you think about it, it is definitely a film the whole family can enjoy, many sequels have followed, but (besides Jurassic World) they have cannot surpass this original blockbuster, a great science-fiction adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Effects, and it was nominated for Best Sound. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 35 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 15 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Family Films.

The plot is thin , there is no character development arc, no moodiness, no real atmosphere, not one single plot twist. Typical Spielberg. Despite this criticism, Jurassic Park is good entertainment for the entire family. Basically this is your typical monster-on-the loose flick, cloned dinosaurs chase a variety of humans, most of whom are sympathetic, while some of the victims are decidedly rotten. The CGI and the puppet animatronics really is the meat of this movie, no pun intended. This was the bleeding edge in film special effects in 1993 and holds up very well today.

307,20 July 2001,hanniballe11752,8, Magnificent,"Never fails to inspire a sense of awe, and fear. There's a sort of mythical grandeur prevading every frame of this film that is by and large absent from The Lost World(I have not seen part three, so I cannot comment on that, though I doubt a change in directors has helped much). I remember that year very clearly. Sitting the theater waiting in anticipation for dinorsaurs. It was just like my first trip to the zoo. Then they did show up after an hour(I think) and it totally blew me away. The sound, the sights! It was too real. Now, of course the movie has flaws(mainly the lack of a real ending, the movie simply stops) but I'd rather not focus on these; Jurrasic Park is a classic adventure movie in the best Spielberg tradition rivaling even Jaws. There is something eeire, wonderous, yet mysterious about the mist shrouded jungle where the movie is set. The leaves moving in the wind to a portentious soundtrack boom is an image that will never leave my mind. I wanted to believe this is was a real place I could travel to, and see the dinosaurs lurking just behind the palm fronds(from a safe distance of course!). Simply a 10/10!",

The thing that this movie also did well was mix a use of both CGI and practical effects. When there was something they could do with practical effects, they used practical effects.

319,10 July 2009,slothropgr,6," Great Dinos, and that's all","Sloppy story-telling from start to finish. It's pretty obvious Spielberg didn't give a damn about anything but the dinosaurs, especially not about tight, coherent plotting or believable characters. When I taught screenplay writing in Santa Fe NM I used ""JP"" as a perfect example of how even established directors who should know better can forget what's important. But Saint Steven's always cared more for effects than logic. And the dinos are impressive, even now. They almost distract one from the illogic of that first Grand Revelation with the brachiosaurs, as definitive a moment for fantasy as the star destroyer's overhead entrance in ""Star Wars."" But Sam Neill & Co approach these walking skyscrapers over a mile or so of gently rolling terrain, and they don't notice them until they're almost under hoof. Like I said, effect over logic. Too many of the characters are superfluous or just plain unbelievable. Jeff Goldblum doesn't add a thing to the plot, he just cracks wise and makes pretentious pronouncements (a faculty he perfected in the sequel). In the book his broken leg gave them a time limit to get off the island before the break went septic, but nothing like that here. Once his leg is broken he's basically forgotten. And Richard Attenborough's John Hammond is a kindly old Scots Santa Claus here, but sends his beloved grandkids out into a park that's chock full of dangerous predators--and even more dangerous computer bugs. In the book at least he was a nasty old SOB, though it was still a thin device. Bad plotting: Wayne Knight has lived on the island for months yet can't find his way to the dock because of a rain storm and a fallen sign?? And why bother with the ""life will out"" theme when it makes no difference? The creatures don't get off the island as they do in the book, so who cares if they can reproduce? If you want to leave room for a sequel, simply dump that and the ""lysine contingency"" and save some time. And finally we come to the biggest fraud of all: the ending, a classic dino ex machina. They're saved from raptors in the nickest of nicks by the T Rex! Who's announced his approach hitherto by making like Godzilla, but here apparently walks on tippy-toes. This was Steverino's inspiration, which shows he knew which side of the movie his box office was buttered on. To paraphrase Eric Clapton about a new rock group he'd just formed called Cream: ""Forget the plot! Forget the characters! Just dinos!"" My solution: after the Rex saves our hapless crew, he chases 'em all the way to the chopper, maybe even grabs a strut in his jaws as the whirlybird is lifting off, and Neill has to hang out and kick them free. Oh well, Spielberg proved with ""Crystal Skulls"" he doesn't know when to quit, so it may happen yet.",

His reactions to the monsters are almost sedate. Sam Jackson literally chain-smokes his way through his wantonly gratuitous scenes as if he has nothing better to do. The best performances are those of the dinosaurs. I guess THAT really sums this one up for me. It COULD'VE been Great, but is, ultimately, a mediocre movie with great fx.",

I would fit them in between the Joker from The Dark Knight and the Emperor from Star wars. This movie is one of the many reasons I love Spielbergs work.

340,13 June 2009,zarrod,10, Spared no expense!,"The release of Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster about a theme park overrun by dinosaurs, Jurassic Park, was surrounded by momentous amounts of hype. Previews and posters were everywhere. Parents were warned that the horror and carnage of the film might be too intense for young children. What most made an impression on me at the time, as a kid in kindergarten, was all the dinosaur merchandise. There were velociraptor sneakers, dilophosaurus backpacks, and triceratops t-shirts; even I had a lunch box featuring a tyrannosaur leering at a car a quarter of its size. As the ill-fated lawyer predicts in the film, Jurassic Park's merchandising alone was worth a fortune. It was a marketing phenomenon even before it was released. All of this buildup created high expectations. Audiences were promised creatures more stunning and realistic than anything they had ever seen before. Jurassic Park delivered, but not only in the special effects department. The film is an artistic and economic accomplishment. Most see the movie's special effects as its greatest legacy and indeed they had no equal at the time. The CGI still holds up well today against some of the more cartoonish creations in films as recent as Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) and the Star Wars prequels (1999-2005). The first dinosaur seen in all its glory on screen is the massive brachiosaur, standing over 40 feet tall. It is one of the most memorable scenes in film history for its visual impact. From the towering sauropods to the agile raptors, the dinosaurs behave so naturally that they are more like animals than movie monsters (not that liberties weren't taken with science for dramatic purposes). Though none of it would have been accepted without the realistic reactions from the actors. Other than the screaming, the acting in Jurassic Park can best be summed up as subtle. Sam Neill turns in a soft-spoken performance as paleontologist Alan Grant. He has a down-to-earth quality that fits perfectly for a man who spends his life digging in the dirt, who is then thrust into an inconceivable situation and does what he must to get out of it. Laura Dern portrays Grant's girlfriend, Ellie Satler. The romance between them is not forced or overplayed. Both of them particularly stand out in the scenes of openmouthed awe when they encounter the creatures firsthand that they have spent years studying. When confronted with the brachiosaur, Grant just manages to stammer, ""It's it's a dinosaur,"" before collapsing to his knees in wonder. These reactions feel authentic and are quite impressive considering that the actors were reacting to CG dinosaurs that were not on set. They are the anchors that make the effects believable. Spielberg knows how to please an audience by making the compelling, but overly technical novel into a coherent adventure film that hits all the right dramatic notes, accompanied by a beautiful and majestic musical score. Audiences responded, making Jurassic Park the highest grossing film ever until the release of Titanic (1997). Of course, fiscal success does not make a film good art. These days, a filmmaker with plenty of money can just throw CG effects on the screen and the masses will still pay to see it for the spectacle. This attempt at imitation is one of the reasons blockbusters often lack the personal touch. Movies like Armageddon (1998), Underworld (2003), and Van Helsing (2004) can get away with having absolutely no substance beneath pretty pictures produced in postproduction. It seems to be an unfortunate side effect of Jurassic Park's digital innovation and subsequent success. I'm convinced that perfection is unattainable within film-making and Jurassic Park is certainly not flawless. For one, velociraptor was actually much smaller; the creature in the film more closely resembles a deinonychus. Also, I've been to San Jose and it is certainly not next to a beach and coastline as it is labeled in the movie. There are also a few sequences that seem formulaic by monster movie standards; however, time is taken to develop the characters so that the audience will actually care if a dinosaur eats them, unlike those nameless souls who are crushed in Godzilla (1954). Logical quibbles can be made over any movie, though, and if you're looking for realism, you can find it outside the realm of cinema. There is no reason I cannot recommend Jurassic Park unless the potential viewer really does not enjoy suspenseful, humorous, and fun adventure-thrillers with a hefty dose of dinosaurs.",

346,7 June 2000,jhaggardjr,10," ""Jaws"" with feet!","WOW!!! ""Jurassic Park"" is a spectacular special effects extravaganza. Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" of the 90s has action, adventure, thrills, excitement, everything you would expect from a special effects picture. ""Jurassic Park"" is about a theme park on an island in the Pacific Ocean that features much different attractions than your usual amusement park. Genetically created dinosaurs are the main attraction here, and a group of scientists, a lawyer, and two kids are invited to view the park. The park is owned by Dr. John Hammond, portrayed by Oscar-winning ""Gandhi"" director Sir Richard Attenborough. He invites paleontologists Sam Neill and Laura Dern; mathematician Jeff Goldblum; lawyer Martin Ferrero; and grandchildren Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards to Jurassic Park and they go on the ride of their lives! If only they can survive after things start breaking down over the park and the dinosaurs begin to run amok. This movie features probably the best special effects ever created for a feature film. The dinosaurs look incredibly real, and they're awesome to watch. The sound effects are scary, especially if you saw this in a theater. The visual effects, sound, and sound effects editing won well-deserved Oscars. Some people said that the performances here come off flat. Well there's no doubt the dinosaurs upstage the humans in the film, but I think the performances are terrific too. Neill, Dern, Attenborough, Mazzello, Richards, and especially Goldblum are very good in this movie. And there are two other familiar faces in the cast in smaller parts: Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Knight as computer technicians who work on the island. ""Jurassic Park"" is one of Steven Spielberg's best movies. It's great fun from start to finish. Followed by the excellent second movie ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"".",

364,13 February 2016,rasthompson,8, Jurassic Park directed by Steven Spielberg,"Jurassic Park is an adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Sam Neill, Richard Attenborough and Jeff Goldblum. I tried to watch this film not too long ago but I wanted to watch a film that had the big blockbuster thrills of Jurassic World (the only Jurassic Park film I had seen at the time) and didn't want to go through the slow-burn beginning. But when I became a little older and a little wiser I put in Jurassic Park once again and viewed it with a lot of pleasure. The slow-burn beginning I now appreciate for the scientific ideas it raises to how a dinosaur could be brought back to life-though I do understand that was from the book. The beginning also sets up the characters who are all well realised by actors subtle and realistic performances and the beginning also has moments that are awe-inspiring still today with the timeless music and blend of amazing practical dinosaurs and CG that still makes me believe that I am seeing a real-life dinosaur moving. But even though I do love the beginning I love the rest of the movie ten times more. Every scene after that is memorable scene whether it's a car falling through a tree or velociraptors trying to kill kids in a kitchen or even just innocent scenes with herbivore dinosaurs. Steven Spielberg's direction and unique camera techniques I could go on forever but you already know what he's like. His direction strongly elevates the film to such a higher level than if the film was directed stalely and stiltedly like a very intense kitchen scene that instead of just cutting to close- ups every ten seconds pans for long amounts of time. Now that might sound that it doesn't mean much but it really gets you more invested in the situation. Now I don't want to make too many comparisons between films but what elevates the dinosaur aspect of Jurassic Park from Jurassic World is that Jurassic Park uses practical aesthetics whenever it can which gets you much more into the scene than if it's complete CGI. But just for clarification I thoroughly enjoy Jurassic World as a blockbuster monster thriller but it's clear which film comes up on top. Now as for the cast they have to be well-acted and likable for you to root for them and hope that they don't die. The two children, the brother and sister aren't annoying and stupid but are genuine kids who are terrified but don't just stand there wide-eyed in front of the dinosaur waiting to be pushed out of the way by an adult. They're genuine kids who would certainly be terrified but they get on because just because they are kids in a movie doesn't mean they shouldn't have the basic human instinct of survival. Sam Neill plays a solid, grounded and kind character that tries to protect the kids and while doing that learns something about him, Jeff Goldblum could be deemed the funny guy but he really is just a good character with some very witty dialogue and Richard Attenborough is excellent as the excited Park manager. My only flaws with the film is that I would have liked a tiny bit more of T-Rex action and I could sort of tell a disposable character would die but the T-Rex action bit I think will be fulfilled in the sequel when I get around to watching it and the disposable character death's while predictable had a brutal pay-off. But apart from those nit-picks I was immersed into the situation and looking back on it I don't think that there was one disposable scene. I was in awe at Spielberg's direction, the practical aesthetics and ground-breaking CG that created the dinosaurs and impressed by the really good performances so for that I am going to give Jurassic Park an A",

Great action and sense of wonderment make this one of the most celebrated blockbusters of all time and with good reason. The effects were top of the art for their time and the movie proved to be a trailblazer for the CGI style of filmmaking. While it doesn't give us a completely groundbreaking story with a great deal of complex characters, it's still entertaining enough to make you root for the people in peril. Plus, charismatic actors like Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum offer a few laughs here and there to balance the mood. For me, Jurassic Park will always be a special movie, as it is to the majority who've watched it. The way everything comes together to give us a near perfect package is the reason I love movies and why names like Steven Spielberg and John Williams inspire me. Hopefully Jurassic World will give me back this happy, careless feeling that the the other sequels took away.",

It of course is about some dino experts, programmers, financial men, and Jeff Goldblum (he is hysterical in this movie) that come to the island and review it to make sure it is safe and correct for the rest of the world if they were to open it up as a park.

It has aged very well considering the dinosaurs still look very real and outdo today's CGI, which is extremely surprising given it's more than 10 years old.  When I did see it in the theaters, it blew me away and scared the poop out of me, and I was 19 years old.  The big question I have is how is it that the CGI was such a success in this film, especially being that it pioneered the CGI world???  It's almost as if they had the secret recipe and didn't give it out while other films since then have tried to duplicate the `real' effects using CGI, only to deliver something resembling an arcade game.  It's truly a shame we haven't advanced much beyond this level of `realness' with CGI.  You would think after 10 years of fine tuning it that we'd be seeing CGI actors in place of the real McCoy's and not be able to tell.  But yet we can't even get something like a guy in a spider suit or the Hulk to look real.  EITHER GET IT RIGHT, OR GIVE IT UP!!!",

As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is ""better"" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. I was sure that the god fun old episode did not like it.

There is so much to learn about Dinosaurs, scientists only know part of the greater story. I once wanted to be a paleontologist when I grew up but then I said I wanted to be a number of things. Wouldn't it be nice to see live Dinosaurs so we could touch them and study them? Would it be possible to control the animals that have been just brought back to life? The movie suggests no way especially if we are going to be ignorant. Malcolm said that life would find a way so breeding them all to be female may not work. The explanation the film gives us for how we could clone dinosaurs is quite logical, scientists said that it could done. (In the future of course) With the use of CGI legendary director Steven Spielberg brought us completely convincing looking dinosaurs. The movie has a terrific story its exciting, entertaining, compelling and a lot of fun. Critics complained that the acting was bad, I thought acting was just fine. The logic behind how the parks electrical system would work is shaky and some of it doesn't make sense. Jurassic Park instantly became an international box office hit. 1993 was a good year for Steven Spielberg he made piles of money from this movie and he won 7 Academy awards for his other movie Schindler's List. 10/10 Great fun for all ages.

However, even if one accepts the silly premise, the film rarely rises above the level of a 1950s monster movie like Godzilla and it goes on too long. It's not clear why the dinos are angry, perhaps they're thinking, we came back after 65 million years for this cheesy movie?

He gives us a step-by-step recreation of the process by which dinosaurs can be resurrected. Then he throws in some kinds of his own. He has a juvenile T. rex finding a helpless human being that is about to become a meal. And the dinosaur plays with his victim, the way a cat plays with an injured mouse.

The place was packed; there had been a lot of buzz about the movie, and—being a preteen dino enthusiast— I begged my parents to take me one Saturday afternoon so I could see what everyone was talking about. When it was over, something profound had occurred. It was the first time I recall feeling an overwhelming sense of wonder at what I'd witnessed. Sure, Star Wars had blown me away as a child, and I absorbed all things Indiana Jones; but there was something about Jurassic Park that completely enveloped me. Much of this, I think, has to do with seeing it on the big screen. It wasn't only that, though; it was the seamless effects, the just-plausible- enough-to-be-believable story, and the intense action (too intense, perhaps, for some kids my age, but I ate it up with a spoon) that made it absolutely unforgettable.

Then I read in the Los Angeles Times an add saying ""If you have seen it once, it is not enough, see it again."" This was simply a blatant way of saying, ""give us more money"" and at that point I decided that I would not see this movie until it either came on television or somebody else paid for it.

I mean the climbing up the electric fence scene and the raptors in the kitchen scene are damn near perfect. If those scenes don't get your eyes glued to the screen, then I don't know what will. The music is great too. It's awe inspiring and it makes your hair stand on end. The characters in this movie feel suitably real as well. They all act like real people. Nobody felt like a fake movie character, which was rather nice. This movie also has possibly my favorite child performances of all time. Both of the kids are fantastic.

400,7 October 2014,byson5186,9, Great Movie That Never Gets Old,"It's interesting to think how this movie is from 1993. You can watch it years later, and it most likely will not feel old to you. The technology in the movie doesn't even seem that old along with the idea of cloning dinosaurs, bringing them back to life. This is also a great movie to watch if you have friends over. I'm sure they've seen it and would love to see it again. It's just a fun, adventure, scary, and happy movie to watch. It's not like a cheesy movie of dinosaurs coexisting with people, but more a movie showing how people figured out how to bring dinosaurs back to life and tried to have an attraction for people at an amusement park known as Jurassic Park. I'll tell you that if there was such a place as Jurassic Park, I'd go if I could as I would think it would be worth it to see dinosaurs in person if the park was secure as it was supposed to be in the movie. The effects they did for the dinosaurs are also really great effects, even in today's standards. The action in this movie will also keep your eyes glued to the screen. So, while this is a great movie it still has its flaws. For one, basically all the areas you see in the movie, except maybe where Dennis Nedry had a brief scene are uncivilized areas, areas most of us probably aren't familiar with. The park was supposed to be on it's own island called, Isla Nublar I forget exactly where it was supposed to be, but obviously it was a park far from civilization as even the people who would want to go to the island would have to do a lot to travel there and as Alan and the others were supposed to be spending a weekend at the park, they don't show things like beds or rooms they could be sleeping in, and it's interesting how the park seemed fully staffed, but almost everyone besides the main characters seem to leave by the time the action starts. Other flaws, well I think the movie had great acting but the actors don't seem like your everyday people. I mean they seem to wear clothes that aren't your everyday clothes, but clothes that work in a dinosaur world. They also don't seem too traumatized after going through some of the most scary experiences you can go through. I mean let's talk about the kids Tim and Lex for example. I feel like none of the kids they've shown in any of the Jurassic Park films seem realistic. But, looking at Tim and Lex, I mean how cool would it be for them to be like the first kids in the world having experiences with dinosaurs being able to see them in person. That doesn't seem like a really big deal for them, they seem mostly there for the tour and we see how Tim mostly seems interested in books especially about dinosaurs, and Lex is interested in computers. But, we don't really hear much about their lives outside of Jurassic Park, I mean obviously they'd have school and stuff which they don't talk about. Also, those two have lots of injuries and go through horrifying experiences and again not really showing signs of trauma or pain and in the next scene they are like telling jokes. The ending scene at Jurassic Park which I won't spoil also seems unrealistic. So, despite these flaws the movie is by all means a great movie, one you can watch over and over again and that never gets old. You could even consider some of the flaws I mentioned, and not that it makes it a bad movie, but questions people like me will have left unanswered. Overall, I give this movie a 9/10. It's a great movie, but some of its flaws keep it from being a 10.",

408,26 June 2013,cwbellor,7," Mayhem, Mathmatics and Megasaurus Egos!","Jurassic Park taught us many things. It taught us that there is nothing scarier than being hunted by a giant wingless bird. It taught us that the T-Rex is a creature of such stealth that it can sneak into a building unnoticed to save the day. But most important of all, we learned from J-Park that the most formidable species to ever exist in this world was the ever adaptive egosaurus. And I'm not talking about prehistoric creatures, I'm talking about modern humanoids. There are three main subspecies that stand out in Jurassic Park. We have Hammond, the Deiasourus who thinks he's a God. There is Malcolm, aka Dr. Chaos, aka the Prophesaurus, who thinks he's the voice of truth and is so full of $#i+, he could probably benefit from an existential enema. And then there's Grant, the Academisaurus who thinks he's the voice of reason and logic. Unfortunately – SPOILERS - all three of these sores survive the carnage and show up for various sequels as well. I guess we're supposed to get some satisfaction out of watching a blood-sucking lawyer get turned into a dino's dinner while he sits on the crapper. Sam Jackson is here too. But unfortunately, you won't hear him say, ""I've had it with these futha muckin' dinosaurs in this futha muckin' park!"" No, the man plays it cool here. The plot is as follows: Hammond can't wait to show his dino pets to the world. He seems so giddy at the prospect that you sense he's gonna wet himself if he has to wait a day longer. But before he can have his grand opening, he must endure a lawyerly island evaluation and the unwanted knee grabs of a leathery mathematician. Hammond is a Scot intent on showing his guests a bloody good time. But for all the expense that he hasn't spared, it turns out that JP has a few glitches. But when things go wrong and Hammond's grandkids are almost eaten by a Tee'd off T-Rex, Hammond is careful not to overreact. ""It's just a delay,"" he says. What follows is a tyrannical trip through the dino dome as Samuel L. Jackson chain smokes, the sole Jurassic park ranger mopes around like he was rejected for the role of Crocodile Dundee and Laura Dern slaps the $#!t out of a log. And just when you thought the meals on heals were free and clear, it turns out there's no manual override for computer controlled door locks.

Although they live quite rustically in a small trailer, they are avid for finding the remains of the large, long-lost reptiles and their food sources. Funded by a wealthy businessman, John Hammond (Sir Richard Attenborough), they are startled to find him at their doorstop one fine day. As Hammond tells it, he needs their help. He has opened a theme park, on an island off the coast of Costa Rica, one that is devoted to dinosaurs. Could these two top-notch scientists come and analyze the place? He, Hammond, would fund their work in America for three more years. They agree and off they go. Joining them as well is Mr. Hammond's lawyer and another scientist, chaos theory master, Dr. Ian (Jeff Goldblum). What the party does not realize is that, using dinosaur DNA found in amber-sap fossils, Hammond has actual dinosaurs grazing on the island! He has stegos, brachios, and, unbelievably, intensely guarded T-rexes and velociraptors! The scientists can't believe what they see. However, as Dr. Ian points out, powerful animals of this nature can not be controlled, for something will always go wrong. Indeed it does. Soon after arriving, the party, which includes Hammond's own two grandchildren, takes a trolley ride tour, one that future visitors will take. But, the scummy computer programmer (Wayne Knight), miffed at his paycheck, steals the dino DNA and runs away, putting the computers in the lurch. Naturally, they break down and the electric fences that guard the fierce creatures quit functioning! Left out in the forests with these monsters, who will stay alive? This is a monumentally great film, in all categories. It has a marvelous cast, a sensational story, intense action sequences, and dazzling philosophical propositions. The computer-generated dinosaurs are utterly amazing and very, very scary. Breathing naturally during a view will be impossible. One of the last scenes, where the T-Rex stands up in full glory while the park sign noting ""dinosaurs ruled the world"" falls to the ground is eye-popping. If you have never seen it, don't delay! Even if you are indifferent to science fiction, action films, or any other genres, this is one film NOT TO BE MISSED! So, grab the DVD and park yourself on the couch for the ride of your life, movie style.",
423,18 December 1999,Rinho,10, My favourite film,"I´m sorry for my English, I think you will find a few mistakes in my comment. But now I start the comment: Jurasssic Park. That´s ( one of ) my favourite film(s) of all time. I loved it from beginning to the end, esspecially the scene which in the T-rex  comes out of his area and starts to hunt the people. The action is great, the music too, Steven Spielberg ( the best director ever )does ( again ) a great job,the special effects are well-made, of course, too and just everything is great. I´ve only seen one Steven Spielberg film which I didn´t like, and that´s Close Encounters of the third kind. But all the other films of him ( Indy 1 - 3, Jaws, Duel, Jurassic Park 1 & 2, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, SCHINDLER´S LIST ) impressed me a lot. I don´t understand why this film doesn´t get the Top250. I don´t understand why films like L.A.Confidential,Touch of Evil, The Godfather Part II, and get the Top250, but not this film. I´ve been interested in Dinosaurs my whole life and so this film is of course great. This isn´t anything like King Kong or Godzilla: The monster(s) must be killed, because we are human and we have the best technology of the world, we can win against the nature ( that´s no English I think ) and so on. This film shows that the dinosaurs are also animals like dogs, cats or fish ( but not sharks ). If you haven´t seen this film yet, GO AND SEE IT ! ! !",
424,9 June 2015,ksmith402,10, One of the greatest,"Jurassic Park is one of the greatest if not the greatest science fiction movie(s) of all time. This was the movie that inspired me to get into filmmaking and inspired my love for dinosaurs. The combination of animal-electronics, practical effects, and groundbreaking CGI make the world of Jurassic Park as well as the dinosaurs feel real and one of the greatest technical achievements in cinematic history and still holds up perfectly today. Unlike movies like Avatar that rely on a cookie cutter story to afloat the CGI, Jurassic Park features a thrilling adventure story that captures the excitement of seeing park that has recreated dinosaurs. The movie explores the themes of consequences that happen when mankind plays with nature that is explored perfectly. The cast is excellent in their performances especially Jeff Gouldblum who brings a lot of comedic spark and flare as Malcom. Jurassic Park is one of the finest examples in cinema of how technical achievement and story can coincide as one whole amazing movie and will continue to be held as an example for generations of future filmmakers to come.",

It is about scientist cloning dinosaurs. There put then in captivity. They break loss and go on rampage. This one of the best scenes fiction movie from 1993. This movie has a great story line.

It's about a park on an island 120 miles west of Costa Rica which has dinosaurs on it that were brought to life by the cloning of their DNA from mosquitoes preserved in amber that had drunk their blood. The park is called Jurassic Park. Scientists and a lawyer are asked to come see the park and give it their endorsement. They aren't told about the dinosaurs. They are astounded when they see their first dinosaur which is a brachiosaurus. They go on a jeep tour of the park and someone who works for the park does a criminal thing and shuts off some of the power and things go horribly wrong. When it was released, it had by way far the best dinosaur special effects ever created in a movie. Those effects still astound people today. The visual effects are absolutely stunning and highly realistic. The sound effects are really great too. Especially the roars and hums and growls of the T-rex. The scares are great with people getting killed and terrorized by the T-rex, raptors and a dilophosaurus.",

435,3 June 2005,gjwslw-2,9, Truly incredible film-making,"I've watched this film many times and have yet to see a technical flub. The only disappointment is Jeff Goldblum. He was the only distraction of an otherwise brilliant film and singlehandedly destroyed Jurassic II. Attenborough was certainly the highlight of the actors and the rest of the cast (excepting Goldblum) were adequate to good. The real star of course, is the brilliant film-making. The only other film that impressed me as much was the original Star Wars. I would give a 10+ for Star Wars compared to a 9 for JP because SW used humor as well as fabulous technique. Too bad so many movies become too tense that the director doesn't realize the audience needs a little break. A prime example was ""Psycho"". The tension just kept building right up through the attack on Janet Leigh. It was about unbearable until Anthony Perkins rolled her car into the quicksand to hide it and it only sank halfway before giving a burp and sinking the rest of the way.

For me the film is still the best movie ever made. It captures the imagination alike ""Star Wars"", ""2001."" As well as grasping hold of the thrills of ""Jaws"" and ""Alien."" The characters are such spectacular ones, filled with ENOUGH LIFE FOR ME AT LEAST, by Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Sir Richard Attenborough and Bob Peck. As well as the others in the cast. Its really a toss up for all the dino-action scenes in the film. Steven Spielberg grips our imaginations and takes us through a wild ride! For me any way, there are some very classic scenes. Many will agree, even though its unfortunate it seems so forgotten. Its CGI is still some of the best and for me AT LEAST, the CGI creates real, living creatures, just like in Jaws and Alien, not just dis-respectable names many people give it. Though the disappointment of the sequel, is the large quanity of missing cast members, it too is a classic wild ride through the very real dinosaurs of the world of Jurassic Park.",

I may only be 14, but this film is still my favourite movie of all time and righteously deserves the title of one the greatest adventure flicks ever made. I first saw this movie at a friends house, as it was released in cinemas when i was just only 1 year old. I was in awe when i saw it then, and still 8 years later i can watch this movie over and it will never lose any of it's charm, thrills or pace. It is a pity, that there has been no film, i believe, released since Jurassic Park that was truly able to capture the excitement and wonder that is a proper adventure flick. The special effects, while amazing (and still stand up proudly over 14 years later), are blended very smoothly with animatronic puppets so as to give an extra sense of realism to the beasties, and the whole thing is strung together with a fantastic sense of pacing, so you are never bored. One thing that has always bugged me, is that this film is never truly recognised as it should be. You wouldn't have to look very far to find a scene that blatantly rips off the classic kitchen scene, and yet Jurassic Park is never recognised as it really should be. I implore you, if anyone is looking to make a fun, energetic, thrilling and charming film then they need look no further for inspiration that the one, the only, the classic JURRASIC PARK.",

Spielberg is running on all cyclienters here with Stan Winston and John Williams giving career defining work. The acting across the board is top notch with Sam Neil, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and The late Richard Attenborough giving their all in a classic morality tale of those who think they have the right to play god.

Over the years I've revisited the original about once every five years or so, and each time I actually gain a bit more of an appreciation for it. The wonder and discovery of the first act is something they were never able to re-capture in the sequels (for obvious reasons) and the white-knuckle intensity of its action scenes are proof of just how good Spielberg was at this sort of thing before he started making these kinds of popcorn films more out of obligation than passion.",
452,17 June 2015,j-penkair,9, A Classic Filmmaking,"Back in 1993, when I was a foreign student in Washington, DC and had lived in an area called Van Ness East, Steven Spielberg and Michael Chrichton were already household names. I watched and read their works well before my coming to America. Upon this film's release, one could see the familiar poster of a T-Rex caricature advertising the film at every Metro (subway) stop. Despite all that, I had no idea how this far-fetched film could find itself a film classic of the world, even more obvious in decades later. My first round at ""Jurassic Park"" occurred at a movie house in Woodley Park, where the National Zoo is. That edition of Time Magazine already had the film on its famous cover and entitled it as ""Jaws 2"". I was confused. How could Spielberg's dinosaur family movie be branded as a monster-horror movie like his own ""Jaws"" years ago? Then, it hit me in the forehead. The ride stoppage in a T-Rex area of the park not only built up fear and extreme excitement for me, but also brought about true shock and deep scar, which remains with me to this day. The devouring of the ""bad-guy"" lawyer made my hair rise up like I myself was eaten. There is no scene in ""Jurassic Park"" that I sensed the director's attempt to do more. It is a masterfully restrained act of the best kind. When the story is that good, someone much wiser told me, you don't have to shout to tell it. This is exactly what Spielberg had done with ""Jurassic Park"". He realized a good story, packaged it with the best ideas and people, then told it solidly and calmly. ""Jurassic Park"" becomes a classic because of such restraints, and not the over-dramatization tried and erred by several subsequent directors.",

471,29 June 2015,orourkec-292-269155,8," Jurassic Park is director Steven Spielberg at his best, but sadly, it doesn't come out as a polished picture","Before starting, let me ask you: doesn't a premise about a park attraction of genetically recreated dinosaurs on an island which is about to turn deadly sound exciting? For me it surely does and it should for you too. Now let's talk about my opinion on Jurassic Park. To start off with, I find Jurassic Park to be a hearty, thrilling (and compelling), thought-provocative and creative motion picture. Not only that, but I also find that Jurassic Park has a powerful attention for details because the way all the dinosaurs from the movie look, move, behave, react and sound is absolutely credible, life-like and realistic to how the dinosaurs might have been or probably were like in real life. There is no doubt about it. Furthermore, we are being happily given enough scenes featuring the fiercest dinosaurs ever to have ruled the earth: the smart Velociraptors and the mighty and powerful T- Rex. The leading characters from the movie deliver fine acting. The by- polar personalities of paleontologist Alan Grant and botanist Ellie Sattler are interesting, including those of the two kids characters. Moreover, Spielberg delivers an irresistible and strong sense of terror, beautifully sustained awe and a beautiful sense of grace. The movie did not entirely satisfy me however and I hate to say such a thing because of what Jurassic Park is specifically about and by whom it is specifically directed by (but of course I must be an honest critic). The movie's big problem is that it somewhat lacks a dramatic structure and deviates from what happens in the novel the movie is based on. What's more, the T-Rex-chasing-jeep scene had no visceral feel for me whatsoever. I have to say that I'm extremely disappointed about all of this. Now let's conclude my review. Mr. Spielberg, one word for you: thank you very much for the wonderful, if not entirely well handled, ride. My rating for Jurassic Park is 8.1/10",
472,5 January 2006,pyrocitor,10, Life has found a way,"I must confess to having always had a soft spot for dinosaurs. Ever since a very young age, dinosaurs have never failed to fascinate, interest, and more importantly, entertain me. I believe the same is also true for most of the general public - dinosaurs are just interesting creatures, no matter what way you look at them. It would therefore seem an excellent premise for a film, to have dinosaurs, which always serve to be entertaining, and show them in a modern context interacting with everyday humans we can relate to and sympathise for. And that, I believe, is the beauty of Jurassic Park - it's ability to blend the real with the fantastic, to make a film that is, in the end, fictional, and yet so grounded in reality. And director Steven Spielberg does so to the extent of his considerable ability here in Jurassic Park.",

The special effects will blow you back, and the soundtrack is probably one of the most spectacular master piece John williams has ever composed. Spielburg did a wonderful job with this and kept to novel written by Michaele Crichton. I rate this 10/10. The dinos were fantasticly done by the special effects workers and not all the dinos were computerized which makes the Jurassic Park series unique.",

A real actors who are acting in the open field blend with animatronics and computer generated special effects in a way that it is really hard to see what is real and what is not. Every installment of the franchise goes deeper and deeper in making this difference even more impossible to see and this is one of the many aspects why it is so great. Add to this an interesting story with strongly carved characters with who you are attached to and you get a classic title which is enjoyable to watch even 30 years later.,

Every time I watch this it feels like I take a trip to the past because this was a movie I watched quite a bit in my childhood years. The concept of people being trapped on a island with dinosaurs is really cool and this movie doesn't disappoint. The dinosaurs in this movie looked stunning and you can tell that a lot of hard work went into them especially since this movie was made in the 90s. This movie also had a good mix between seriousness, silliness, and action. I definitely recommend watching it.",

Since then I've tried to watch it every time it's come on TV and have three copies on video (the first two got eaten, velociraptor style, by my partner's VCR). I still love the film's unashamed sense of wonder, personified by several characters including the eccentric John Hammond, and its sense of humour (who, having seen this film, could forget Dr. Malcolm?).

If you are looking for well-developed human characters, great dialogue or top-notch acting Jurassic Park is hit-or-miss. There are some interesting characters, some snappy, witty lines and a few notable acting performances. But there are also some one-note, rather dull characters, some truly inane conversation and some performances which leave something to be desired. But have I mentioned the dinosaurs? A remarkable technical achievement for its time Jurassic Park places fully realized, totally believable dinosaurs right smack-dab into this live-action movie. Watching the human characters interact with each other can at times be rather dull. Watching the human characters interact with these amazing dinosaurs, many of whom are bent on eating the humans for dinner, makes it all worthwhile.",

This is truly some of Spielberg's greatest work and I couldn't love it more. Jurassic Park is one of the three movies in the Jurassic Park trilogy. Jurassic Park is about John Hammond a dinosaur enthusiast who constructs a dinosaur theme park with living biological attractions. These are no animatronic animals but dinosaurs that are created to live and breath the air of man. As usual their is a dark side to every fantasy and the dream is threatened when the park systems break down, all hell breaks loose leaving the tourists and workers left for survival. Their are some great scenes with great uses of CGI and animatronic dinosaurs along with some extraordinary performances, cinematography all in this compelling adventure film.",

The characters were well written, including the casting, I can not imagine any other actors doing better jobs than Sam Neil, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Wayne Knight. Moreover, the directing is some other great part that made the movie successful but a normal guy like me can not really talk about it, but I will refer the viewer to watch documentaries and behind the sets to feel the great work that happened in the early 90s. This movie is definitely one of the top movies in my All Time Movies.

485,1 October 2011,sddavis63,5, If You See A T-Rex - DON'T MOVE!!!,"There are a lot of good things about ""Jurassic Park."" The effects on the dinosaurs are excellent. The dinosaurs look, sound and move like real animals. They are completely and totally believable. There's a good reflection on the dangers involved when humanity insists on interfering with the natural world - dinosaurs went extinct without any help from human beings; maybe - even if we could bring them back - human beings should leave them that way is the most direct theme of the movie, although one can easily see the application of that theme about the dangers of human interference in the natural scheme of things going far beyond dinosaurs. And when ""Jurassic Park"" is exciting - it's very exciting and when it's suspenseful it's very suspenseful. I think of the t-rex chasing the car and trying to get at the children, or the children desperately hiding and trying to escape from the velociraptors. That's all well done, and the children were actually pretty good in their parts, very believably terrified. This is one of the better performances I've ever seen from children. But, to be honest, it wasn't very consistent.",
486,17 May 2006,nhlgumby,6, Jurassic Park,"This time Steven Spielberg makes a movie about dinosaurs. He made some films about aliens, about sharks, and about action heroes before, and now he's made a film about dinosaurs. If you can't tell, I'm pretty apprehensive about this movie. I didn't like this movie. No, actually, it was okay. It was just too mawkishly sentimental for my tastes. Spielberg has obviously become the master at manipulating emotions as scene after scene barrages the viewer with images that breathe too sickly sweet in my face. Behind the excitement of a movie about nature running wild lies the heavy-handed morals of the film: stealing and double crossing is punishable by the innocent and unguided forces of nature, money is a corruptible power, sometimes nature might be better left untouched, and keeping the family unit intact is priority number one, as is always the case in all of Spielberg's movies. But in the foreground of all of that morality is this awesome visual roller coaster ride filled with some of the most breathtaking computer video images and hand crafted puppetry I have ever seen. It's a toss up. I can take those images of the ""Jurassic Park"" banner falling around the tyrannosaurus rex being attacked by raptors on one side and compare that to the image of a tyrannosaurus rex chasing one of the jeeps in the rear view mirror with the words ""object in mirror may be closer than it appears"" on the other. Those are some cool images, but one smacks of contrived metaphor and the other screams with raw power juxtaposed with situational irony. I'll always respect Spielberg as one of cinema's powerhouse figures, but there will always be something to disagree about. On the disc with the movie were a number of behind the scenes featurettes including Spielberg with his creative team planning out images from the movie in pre-production, as well as a perfectly matched stop motion animation mock up of the raptor hunt scene in the kitchen. I would personally love to see someone take the whole movie and turn it into this kind of film-making. Picked this up at the University library.",

The characters are a flat and Jeff Goldblum is particularly irritating and completely out of place in this script. The dinosaurs however, are absolutely incredible and the the scenes involving them (which are by far the best parts) still look authentic nearly three decades later.

Neil would be good in the third, but Goldblum sucked in the second.  The kids as some have mentioned are kind of annoying, but you learn to put up with it. Samuel L.

The acting interaction in this scene between Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Richard Attenborough was very heartfelt (attributed to their acting skills and director Steven Spielberg), the cinematography was spectacular, and last but not least, the music of John Williams. I must make a special note here, John Williams' score for this film is legendary, having really gotten me first hooked to film music and then films in general in the first place. I really do look forward to each successive score that maestro Williams does (I just bought Memoirs of a Geisha - another great score).

It still impresses youngsters and grannies alike, and more importantly, it still impresses me.  Disregarding the book (which seems to be the only book anyone has ever read), the plot about meddling with nature seems more relevant now than it ever did.  Admittedly, the film isn't very well paced, with whopping areas where the only object of fascination is Sam Neill's face, but the now-famous T-Rex chase and bit-with-raptors are both landmarks of cinema and a little bit pant soiling.  When this film was released, films that were 7 years old then looked rubbish (apart from Aliens of course), so we should praise J.P and shower it with rose petals.  Huzzah!",

The development of the story is also very thrilling and exciting, with some horror and humor, and also the nightmare that was a childhood night has been reborn again. A thrilling encounter brought a thrilling adventure. The significance of the film lies not only in its plot, in line with theoretical thinking, but also in the meaning that spans the film era, but also makes us countless people remember the great director
The first half of the bedding is still very cumbersome. When the dinosaurs appeared, they looked at the vibration of the water cup. The sense of suspense is similar to that of ""Great White Shark"".

It consists of getting Jurassic mosquitos that bit dinosaurs in order to acquire their genes. This would lead them to bring dinosaurs to the present time. So he asks a few archeologists to approve a kind of dinosaurs zoo, it will not end well. The cinematography is excellent. In one scene, some kids are hiding from two lethal dinosaurs. In another, you can see how a dinosaur is being born. This movie may sometimes be harsh and maybe scary for kids under 8.

In Jaws, for comparison, the shark isn't see clearly until half way in the movie.  But the dinosaurs shown early in Jurassic Park aren't dangerous or intimidating; they aren't monsters.

The low camera angles in most of the scenes let the viewer feel as though they are in the park, gazing up at the Brontosaurus for the first time. The ""evil"" in this film is not the dinosaurs, but rather the individuals trying to exploit them for monetary gain and power.

Man creates island of dinosaurs, needs experts to come out and validate safety/accuracy of park, and then things go horribly wrong. It's simple but very effective. Each shot tells a visual story in itself and enhances the writing in a way that drives the story forward without every feeling rushed or too slow. The acting is incredible.

If you haven't seen the film, you need to. It's interesting, logical, and unrealistic as hell, but makes you feel like it could actually happen.

595,20 June 2011,nohr01,10, Timeless Movie,"The film Jurassic Park is about a theme park that Dr. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) and his team created. The theme park, called Jurassic Park, is like a zoo of dinosaurs which were created through genetic engineering. Before the park is able to be opened to the public, Dr. Hammond must get approval from an array of people, including scientists Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), stating that the park is safe for the public. The dinosaurs end up breaking out of their electric cages due to a power outage and wreak havoc on the entire island and the people on the island. I believe the important lesson to learn from this movie is that technology is great to a point, but technology cannot be completely relied on; the human mind and variables are crucial in many applications. In the film Jurassic Park, Dr. Hammond and his team used technology to create an island full of deadly genetically engineered dinosaurs. Technology was also used to contain these animals; the entire island relied on a computer system. As we all know, most computer systems fail at one point or another, which is what caused the destruction of the island in this film. The writer of the novel and the screenplay Jurassic Park, Michael Crichton, also directed a film with a similar theme. The film Runaway (1984) focuses on what happens when a machine goes bad; again, technology can be helpful, but it can also be hurtful if not used in the correct way. The special effects used in this film were amazing, especially for their time. The dinosaurs in the film seemed like they were actually real thanks to special effects. This goes to show that technology can be extremely useful; but when taken too far, it can also be devastating. There is a fine line between the helpful use of technology and the destructive use of technology. Also, the sound effects were excellent. The sounds of the dinosaurs made you feel like you were actually a part of the film. When a dinosaur would roar, it made me feel scared for the characters of the movie; especially when you could not see where the dinosaur was, you could only hear it. The sound effects used added to the film to make it seem more realistic. The sound effects also instilled emotions, such as fear and anxiety, in me as I was watching the film. I thought that they were implemented very well into the plot and the theme of the movie. All-in-all I thought this was a great film. The theme is timeless because we will always be dealing with the ups and downs of technology; especially nowadays when everything seems to be turning to technology because of the preciseness and the cost-savings. I saw the film when I was a young kid, and to this day, I still love to watch it over and over again.",

But of course, you all know Spielberg has the potential of making great movies. However, I was disappointed in the story. The original story (from the book) was to prove the fact how humans can easily destroy themselves when it comes to tampering with nature, but Steven never really brings out that message as it was suppose to be. It was more focused on the action and adventure of the dinosaurs. But for those who never even heard of the book wouldn't have any disappointment. I thought Richard Attenborough did a good job portraying the role of John Hammond and I think Jeff Goldblum is great in it as well. Sam Neill and Laura Dern did average jobs on the film I think (Laura Dern up by one point). So with the cast, Spielberg, and his friend George Lucas who developed the special effects, I think you got a great film!",

I used to always watch this as a child and it blew my mind. The CGI is probably the best any movie has ever done. The performances are good, but its an action movie so you shouldn't expect much from it. The movie teems with magical movie moments that just dazzle the screen, such as the magical scene with the brachiasaurus, the first dinosaur ""seen"" in the movie. The effects are amazing as stated earlier, so great, that Jack Horner tells people to see Jurassic Park to see real dinosaurs, not museums. That explains that even scientists are astounded.

If i we're a novelist i would virtually write a story very very much like this one. Witnessing Goldblum's humour that had it all, it's a good thing that Spielberg directed it.

In fact, I was so traumatized by the experience that the next time I went to Chuck-E-Cheese, I hid under a table. Then years later, I saw the movie again when I was about 13-years old and I absolutely fell in love. The storytelling is simple. Man creates island of dinosaurs, needs experts to come out and validate safety/accuracy of park, and then things go horribly wrong. It's simple but very effective. Each shot tells a visual story in itself and enhances the writing in a way that drives the story forward without every feeling rushed or too slow. The acting is incredible. The music is something that's stayed with me for years. Although, that's partly because I've watched this movie at least 15 times since I fell in love with it.

However it's the Velociraptor who comes across us viewers as the more intimidating, particularly in the kitchen scene with Lex and Tim, which is the most scariest scene I've seen from any movie.

The music by John Williams is another highlight that blends so perfectly with each and every shot.

660,29 April 1999,Amblin,9, Epitomises the title 'A STEVEN SPIELBERG FILM'.,"What can one say after witnessing one of the greatest motion pictures of all time? The creative genius has done it again, by simply returning to the thriller genre that shot him to fame with Jaws.....with the same intensity and thrills. But this time around, Spielberg has the aid of CGI...which made JP such a landmark film. Using the visual effects, Steven has captured the imagination of the entire planet, making JP the most successful film of all time (until 1998). He has tapped into the audience's greatest fears, and used them against us to a horrifying degree. Who can forget the terrifying T-Rex first lumbering out of her enclosure, and don't forget her chasing the tour jeep! This is the ultimate Steven Spielberg film......if ever there was one......an adventure/thriller surpassed by no other. Seeing this for the first time in 1993 when I was only 11 years old....it scared the crap out of me. I couldn't sleep for a week....let alone eat properly. I am proud to be part of the JP phenomenon....as it certainly defined a Steven Spielberg film. As always, his direction of the characters is unique, and will never be rivalled.....never. Just take a look at character reactions to the dinosaurs, and especially the apparent misunderstandings between Alan and Tim. John Williams' score is awesome.....once again defining a Spielberg film. Williams' originality in the thriller genre has also been revisited 18 years after Jaws. Michael Kahn's film editing in the continuity aspect of things is the only flaw, where one can immeadiately pick up on his mistakes.....although, there are not many, the mistakes sure do stand out like a sore thumb. In spite of this, the continuity doesn't let the film down.....as the common movie-goer rarely picks up on editing mistakes (thank God!) especially in a movie like this when you're more concerned about crapping your pants  for 120 mins straight. Overall, JP is a gem when it comes to thriller film-making.....it epitomises the genre and the credit 'A Steven Spielberg Film'. It's not hard to understand why this monster movie made $913 million at the box office.",
661,9 August 2011,johnnyboyz,7," Not without a certain flair, and certainly a lot more than mindless creature-feature thrills, Jurassic Park is quite the involving little adventure film.","Jurassic Park is Spielberg theme park hijinks unfolding in that of a theme park; his film a cut and thrust escapade through varying B-movie traits, tracts and ideas totalling up into an experience akin to that of romping through an array of 'themed' locales within a park proper. By the time one has had a go on the dodgems and the ghost train, one has been there long enough and built up enough verve for the huge trademark roller-coaster ride; after that experience, we bring ourselves back down with a shooting range or some spinning tea-cups. There are some terrific scenes of terror, chase and thrills in Jurassic Park that essentially act as the park's ""leaner, meaner"" rides, and they are dotted around some other sequences that effectively act as a prelude to those ""leaner, meaner"" rides – the fun of the fair before we're strapped in proper for the big one.",

Jurassic Park was a very big disappointment to me, because I had expected much more from Spielberg, instead, it was a solid and at times very slow paced and mediocre adventure film. The first half was like an interminable introduction, it was too slow paced, I expected some action or fun, had none of them. Then I ask, where is fun in the first half? I had expected a perfectly directed, also perfectly written action, suspense, suspense or a gribbing story, but it was uninteresting till the second half. The only successful thing in the movie is visual effects, as you know, it was a revolutionary experience in cinema in that year. I appreciate, but as an adventure or action, I think that the movie is just OK. In the second half, I had expected that there would be a battle between the family and the dinosaurs. A do-or-die fight, but couldn't find anything spectacular. JP is a movie which when you are shocked by electric wire, nothing happens, but your hair bristles!

That isn't a negative, really, as the director was still clearly in his prime, but it does fit quite snugly next to the other family-friendly adventure flicks in his portfolio in that it's big and intense without going so far over-the-top as to scare the kiddos. Of course, at the time the real star here was the film's fantastic effects work - it was CGI's coming out party, after all - and that aspect has aged surprisingly well over the past two decades. Sure, if we look closely a few seams might show here or there, but the raptors remain unsettlingly vivid and our first glimpses of a grazing brachiosaurus remain nothing short of stunning. Some excellent casting decisions enrich the whole package (Jeff Goldblum is pitch-perfect as the muttering, brainy Ian Malcolm) and there are plenty of character moments scattered about to flesh out the more extravagant action sets.",

The reasons for this is because even though this movie was released in 1993, when I was almost two years old (I was born in 8/91, you see), the effects are still quite convincing (in most cases better than the bad CG effects in modern movies), the script is very nicely done, has extremely good music, & the best dinosaur-related scenes ever, including the famous T-rex attack in the thunderstorm. I also like how they not only have the T-rex, but also other dinos too like the spitting dino (forgot its name), triceratops, duckbills, & aptosaurus. I guess you can say this is the movie that fueled my fascination with dinosaurs. Overall:If you have not seen it, rent it now, & don't forget to read the two books by Micheal Crichton too!

Good Lord was I wrong I don't think it was visual aspect of the film that scared me, I had seen dinosaur bones and paintings of them all the time, it was the incredible sound of the film, the screams were loud, the animal noises were vicious, feral and sometimes gentle, you could hear flesh being and glass and it made you feel like you were there, thus was at my mother's side the whole time sweating and whimper a little in her arms, not one of my proudest moments but hey I was a kid :) As I got older and watched a few more times I realized just how wonderful this film really is, a visual masterpiece with superb acting, Jurassic Park will remain one of those films that continue scaring and amazing audiences for years to come",

696,2 January 2014,GLanoue,5, Trite and overblown insult to collective intelligence,"It's perhaps not fair to judge a film 20 years after it came out, but on the other hand, that's how people define classics. This film fails. Yes, stunning CGI effects. Great photography. But the script is horrible. First, Spielberg's standby dysfunctional American family is in full bloom, with smart aleck kids and incompetent adults who when faced by technical challenges and alleged science seem to have an attention span of a five year old. No one listens to anyone else, no one collaborates, and the only voice of reason philosopher Dr Malcolm is played by Jeff Goldblum as a caricature. Every conceivable corny camera set up or angle is exploited, every lush note of John William's heroic score is designed to substitute the lack of human chemistry among the cast, every character reacts in a stereotypical fashion. Granted, perhaps Spielberg wanted idiot-savants (kids and adults alike) to showcase the dinos' personality, but even here we are treated to ridiculously anthropomorphised creatures instead of nature in the raw. I mean, dinos opening doors? The T-Rex was scary because it was hunting, not playing. Even the park's UNIX computer system is given a ridiculously amusing and needlessly complicated graphics Next-Generation interface to heighten the drama of rebooting the system after it is sabotaged. Not that this interface wasn't doable in 1993, but no one-of specialised system would have anything but text commands for such a massively complicated park. So, humanised computers, humanised dinos, but one dimensional humans. If it wasn't for the massive publicity campaign that let it slip that the film was 'about' hubris and so worthy of being taken seriously, this wouldn't pass muster with any but the simple-minded. In the end, the script is completely predictable, and no amount of gorgeous camera work can substitute hackneyed plotting.",

No, but it doesn't try to be. Also- look at it from the filmmaker's perspective: You know this film is about dinosaurs chasing people, most of the cast is returning meaning they don't need to chart the backstory or waste time with character development. And this is what JP3 is- a taunt 90 odd minute thrill ride.

Crichton's book, which was tedious but rich with characterizations and scientific plausibility (without being overly technical) gives way to a script in which the characters have no personalities, the scientists have no backgrounds to bring them or their ideas to this point, and the dinosaurs are, for all intents and purposes, just THERE. You can say all you want about how wonderful it was be frightened to death by real-looking dinosaurs (would you really know one if you saw it?), but even ""Land of the Lost,"" a 1970's Sat. morning live-actioner about a man and two children (his own) transported back in time and trying to survive amid free-roaming dinosaurs, had more of a plot than this garbage. And for all the hype about visuals, I, for one, would like to think we still go to the movies to be drawn into another world and other lives, not just an amusement park. Look for a few good one-liners out of Jeff Goldblum as chaos-theorist Ian Malcolm (allegedly based on at least one real-world ecologist), and completely lifeless performances from the otherwise reliable Sam Neill, Samuel L. Jackson and actor-turned-Gandhi-director Richard Attenborough, as well as non-actress Laura Dern.

I saw it with my Dad and my younger sister in 93 when it first released, at the time I had seen nothing like it. It was a very expensive movie to make, a lot of money was spent not only on the superb special effects but also the merchandising(the books,the toys etc). It was money well spent, Jurrasic Park went on to make millions and millions(it is in the top 10 grossers ever). The special effects were way ahead of it's time, the Dinosaurs looked so real and terrifying. I watched Jurrasic Park a couple of weeks ago and realised it holds up remarkably well,special effects have advanced since 93 yet the special effects for Jurrasic Park still look great. Adapted from a Micheal Chriction novel(which is also superb) it tells the story of people who visit a Dinosaur theme park and how their lives are put in danger during a blackout when the Dinosaurs escape. Spielberg put in some great moments of tension, for instance in the scene where they are sitting in the jeeps and the glass in the front of the jeep starts to vibrate is absolute genius. I love the part in the end where they are going back in the helicopter and there is that shot of the bird which reminds us how the Dinosaurs have evolved.",

Dennis Nerdy set the dinosaur free, one part I like is when the Tyrannosaurus Rex give chase to Ian Malcom, Elite Slater and that one guy, who is doing the driving, it shows the Tyrannosaurus Rex's speed, one thing for sure, the Tyrannosaurus Rex could catch up and eat the one closed to him. There is a mistake in this screen, if the Tyrannosaurus Rex has catch-up to the Jeep, instead of roaring to the mirror, it should snatch Iam Malcom off the Jeep, but at the end, the Tyrannosaurus Rex stop, I think the Tyrannosaurus Rex never gives up, unless he was very tired of chasing them. The end part of the movie, I like it too, the Tyrannosaurus Rex stop the Raptor, but this is the mistake, instead of smell or smoothing or trying to strip some flesh of the Raptor would it just chew a little while swallowing the whole body.

We saw it in the movies and I could not wait till it came out on video. When it did, my kids would watch it over and over (and so did I). I remember cooking dinner in the kitchen and hearing them start the movie. Once I heard the ""thumping"" of the escaping T-Rex, dinner was always put on hold. I was drawn into the living room and just couldn't stop watching from that point. When Jeff Goldblum says, ""Must go faster!"" and then follows shortly with, ""You think they'll have THAT on the tour?"" I just can't stop laughing.

In my opinion, it's near perfect, and no dinosaur movie (or TV show) that has followed it has come even close to touching it, not even the series this movie spawned.

I have to admit that I have watched this movie more than enough time than I want to admit, this movie is spectacular and there is no doubt about it. It is also a very good achievement in directing; Spielberg sets the scene to make us feel so immersed, as if we are actually on Islar Nublar ourselves. Whenever it rains you fear the T-Rex will come out of nowhere, it is a masterpiece and has been severely underrated as it will leave you in probably one of the best moods after watching a movie.

That's right and how in the hell did this abomination of a movie get a better rating than Titanic on this site. The reason for my strange praise for Titanic is because at least Titanic had a story at the foreground and special effects were used to support the story. The opposite is happening in this movie where the special effects take the front seat and in fact is the only purpose of this movie. Everything in this movie is horrible except for the special effects. If you want Spielberg at his best then watch Saving Private Ryan or Minority Report. 1 out of 10.,
736,13 February 1999,GluStick,9, Great movie. Boring start.,"This movie was really great. Don't get me wrong. I loved it. But I really think the first half of this could have been A LOT better. The action doesn't even start until an hour of viewing. But what follows is absolutely terrific. It scares you at times when dinos pop out of nowhere and it is one f/x movie that people really liked. Most movies of this kind (Independence Day, Godzilla, Armageddon, ect. Which I liked ALL of) are movies that don't really please like this movie. It's got really smart action sequences and fairly good acting but I think they should have used more popular stars, but you mostly concentrate on the dinosouars, which do good acting jobs. I thought they would have been nominated for Best Actresses. The f/x are another thing. They look really good! Only if the first half was more exciting but oh well. The rest of the movie makes up for that mistake. That leaves one more thing. The sequel. I thought the sequel was top notch. It was even better than this movie. In my opinion, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is just slightly better than the first because it starts out with more action. That's unlikly for sequels. Watch them both. They will be remembered for generations. Until they become extinct. Or when the next blockbuster hits with great f/x and good script. Crowd-pleasers are so hard to find these days, aren't they?",

The more spectacular of these involve the fierce, life-like dinosaurs that stalk through the film with astounding ease. Much scarier, however, are those aspects of ""Jurassic Park"" that establish it as the overnight flagship of a brand-new entertainment empire. Even while capturing the imagination of its audience, this film lays the groundwork for the theme-park rides, sequels, and souvenirs that insure the ""Jurassic Park"" experience will live on. And on. And on. This is a fairground ride of a movie, and as such it's one of the best. Suspense and technical wizardry are the only reason to watch ""Jurassic Park.""

The idea of man and dinosaurs walking the Earth at the same time intrigues the child within all of us. The cast plays their parts beautifully, sticking to how Crichton made them in his book.

This is a big problem for the main creator of the dinosaurs, for he wanted to open up the park so the public could see the wondrous, and also vicious monsters they've created. Its bad for him because the president of the U.S won't let him open the park until he's had at least three experts (Portrayed to perfection by Sam Niel, Jeff Goldblume, and Laura Dern.) inspect the island and see if it's all right. Of course, the dinosaurs later break free from their cages when a man shuts down the power to the park trying to pull of a heist, and all hell breaks loose.

The thing about Jurassic Park is that it perfectly combines these stunning visuals into a believable and entertaining story line (not that T2 doesn't, which, in my opinion is actually better). It seems like Steven Spielberg has a real talent in entertaining us but at the same time not letting us laugh at the script, acting, or cheese (No doubt Indiana Jones was pretty high on the cheese level, but still). I will say again what ever other reviewer has said long before me - Jurassic Park is the definition of a blockbuster.

789,22 November 2019,mfellipecampos,8, Very good,"Jurassic Park (in Brazil, Jurassic Park - Parque dos Dinossauros) is an American adventure and science fiction movie from 1993 directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the eponymous book written by Michael Crichton. Produced by Amblin Entertainment and distributed by Universal Pictures, it stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Ariana Richards, Joseph Mazzello, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bob Peck. The film is centered on the fictional Isla Nublar, where a billionaire philanthropist and a small team of geneticists create an island theme park where the main attractions are varied dinosaur species recreated through genetic engineering. A park built by a millionaire (Richard Attenborough) is home to several dinosaurs, extinct sixty-five million years ago. This is possible because a fossilized insect was found, which had sucked blood from these dinosaurs, from which the DNA, the chemical code of life, could be isolated, and from that point recreated in the laboratory. But what seemed like a nightmare dream, when the experience gets out of control of its creators. The special effects were very well done were produced by Industrial Light & Magic (with effects created by computer graphics) and Stan Winston Studios (with effects produced by animatronics). The virtual reenactment of the flesh-and-blood dinosaurs with the actors was a tremendous box office success. Script simply very good (only almost sleeping twice) is not because it is less interesting for me I found it very interesting, but I was tired so it happened, chose the actors very well, very good musical background and my movie score was going being 10.0 (masterpiece) out of 10.0 I have already explained why tiredness so my movie grade is 8.0 (very good) out of 8.0.",

The special effects were truly remarkable in its day, and the dinosaurs still look impressive today, 20 years later. The T-Rex escaping through her fence and attacking the 2 children still gives me shivers. True, the story may not be all that believable, but its a film for entertainment, not education. It is truly a classic and well worth adding to your film collection. Pity about the 2 sequels, however. But Jurassic Park, standing on its own, is as impressive today as it was all those years ago.",

There isn't a lot of personality here and when the Dinosaurs are not on display it tends to be a bit boring with very one dimensional characters. I remember at the time expecting way more from Steven Spielberg and his amazing Directing abilities from his previous films, JAWS and close encounters to name a few.

803,3 September 2006,Phillemos,8, More Velociraptors!!! More Tyrannosaurus rex!!!!!,"This is probably the best all-around dinosaur movie ever made. Yet I somehow feel the need to write about its flaws more than what was great about it. FLAWS: 1) You'd think a movie that invests so much into dinosaurs would get some basic facts straight. It's ""StegOsaurus,"" not ""StegAsaurus"" as it says on one of the DNA vials. And the Velociraptors are way bigger than they would have been in real life, the creatures in question are probably the much bigger Deinonychus, not Velociprator. Conversely, the Dilophosaurus is much smaller than it would have been in real life. If they had shown it real size, they wouldn't have had to concoct the ""spit-kill"" scene. 2) The movie drags at times. Just stick with the dinosaurs-run-amok theme. We don't care about all the peripheral dinosaurs they show from time to time that have nothing to do with the movie. Great, there's a sick Triceratops lying in its own dung. You won't see him again, so why bother showing him in the first place? 3) When Dr. Neill, Jeff Goldblum and the kids are in their Jurassic Park-mobiles, they can sense the T-Rex coming from the vibrations and sounds of his footprints for about five minutes. Yet, when they're being attacked by the ""Velociraptors,"" the T-Rex all of a sudden appears out of nowhere to save their a**. You couldn't hear T-Rex coming then? I would have liked to see a pack of five or six Velociraptors battle the T-Rex, just to make it more interesting. That said, this really is an entertaining movie. Among the characteristics that make this movie so good are: 1) The dinosaurs are first-rate, the best and most realistic ever. 2) Laura Dern's backside. We get to see her scale up and down walls to run away from dinosaurs all throughout the movie, and it's a wonderful sight. 3) All the lawyers get it in the end. Overall, they finally made a dinosaur movie that actually could receive critical acclaim. I give it an 8 out of 10.",
804,19 February 2015,brianberta,8, This film has everything which makes a good sci-fi movie,"This film has everything. Action, tense scenes, great acting, and great cgi. Despite being made over 20 years ago, the dinosaurs still look better then much of today's cgi. The plot is about a group of people going to an island with live dinosaurs. But some of the workers are trying to smuggle embryos off the island and they turn off the power releasing all the dinosaurs. The survivors then have to make it off the island before they get killed. This movie has dozens of memorable scenes which are too many to name all of them but the most memorable for me is when we first see the T-Rex destroy the car. The movie actually explains why the dinosaurs exist and it explains how they made them. Even though this can't happen in reality, it's always impressive for sci-fi films to have the plot have believable elements. Realism isn't necessary but it does make them more interesting to me. The 2nd and 3rd movies weren't that good compared to this one but ""Jurassic World"" might be the one that brings back the charm of the original one.

Of course, the answer given by the director is no. It can be seen that this reflects the modern West's understanding of the limitations of science after introspection of science since the 20th century. Science cannot be an excuse for human arrogance.

Thankfully, the film came out in 1993 when we were dino-crazy and the special effects, which come off as simply family friendly, were seen as some scary shtuff... Richard Attenborough as Walt Disney like rich wanna be was just silly. His enormous theme park of wild beasts has no more than 15 employees and he only comes to the epiphany that what he was attempting was grotesque in a side comment during his escape. Our silly bad guy is the nerdy tech, played by Wayne ""Newman"" Knight (whose character is called Nedry - get it?). When Samuel L Jackson needs to sit at the workspace he's been sitting only 10 feet from for presumably years, he does so with an ash- dripping nasty cigarette and states to his boss, ""man, how can this guy work in such filth"" as he pushes away hordes of empty candy bar wrappers and empty coke cans..... just stupid. The dialog in this is embarrassing, yet Jeff Goldblum resumes his rambling scientist common sense, which is always fun. Laura Dern does her best in the silly I wanna be a Mother role, so she can't say much or we'd hate her. Sam Neill does OK, fighting off the oncoming fatherhood train by being a perfect role model and caretaker for the two grandkids of our old coot dressed in all white like this is Fantasy Island. The lawyer gets it first ids like Las Vegas getting nuked first in War Games. These two movies are a bit on the same level, but the latter keeps your sense of disbelief a bit longer and that's where this is a Classic Jurassic fail.

For starters, they say that the velociraptors are too big, they find other mistakes, etc.  However, the movie is about CREATING dinosaurs.  The dinosaurs are not real, they are manufactured by humans through DNA.  They said in the movie that the DNA they find isn't complete and they fill in the blanks with frog dna, etc.  So to all the people & experts complaining about some inaccuraties, remember that those are not real dinosaurs but ones that were created by humans in some lab.  Therefore the dinosaurs are kind of ""monsters"" created through some real dinosaurs dna and of course you can't expect them to be exactly like the real thing.  That being said, the dinosaurs are VERY close to reality, and raptors that big DO exist (Utahraptor has been discovered and is even bigger then the ones in JP), it's just that their name is different.  Overall, the dinosaurs are very accurate and whenever there's inaccuraties, the explaination is that they were created in a lab by humans.  Even today a lot of unanswered questions remain, so nobody can say how dinosaurs were and behaved 100%, JP movies are the closest you'll ever come to dinosaurs.",

We must have jumped several times being that close to the screen but it was awesome! This classic, directed by Stephen Spielberg, is one of his all time greatest films. The cast is fantastic especially the soundtrack by John Williams. The score is beautiful and haunting all in one and many times it has given me goosebumps usually when we see the dinosaurs for the first time. The special effects are outstanding! The dinosaurs look and sound so life-like you actually wish such a place would exist! Jeff Goldblum's character, Ian Malcolm, is the scene stealer! There is no question in my mind why he is the star of the sequel. If your looking for a film that is humorous, creative, thought provoking, and a little scary at times...this film is for you.",

I can still remember when my lower jaw dropped and thundered into the carpet as that Brachiosaur was revealed in all its CG glory. This is the film that put digital effects on the map. I can still remember that first Tyrannosaur attack. Steven Spielberg, the master of the suspenseful build up, crafted one of the most memorable and terrifying sequences ever to be unleashed upon an unsuspecting public. My heart still beats a might faster today as it did back then when that scene comes up. I can still remember the screams in the audience as the Velociraptor rammed its head through the fence behind Laura Dern, in a scene akin to that of the 'head through the hole in the bottom of the boat' scene from Jaws. From Jeff Goldblum's trademark quirky performance to the now legendary effects this movie is an exercise in excitement and terror, mixed in with a little message about the dangers of cloning and science run rampant, best outlined in Dr.Malcolm's speech at the dinner table.

Nowadays there are hundreds of people who share a type of cult following to the film.

Jurassic Park isn't just a film, it's like a gateway into the imagination of a child that we can all share a piece of. Even today, parents and child alike can both share in this wonderful masterpiece. Yes, some are eaten and killed by dinosaurs, but not in such a horrific and graphic way that would make a child too uncomfortable. It also serves us who are a tad more scientifically oriented, as a reminder of how precious and delicate life is. How we shouldn't be so quick to try and achieve things simply because they are possible...but shouldn't really be achieved due to our humanity.

With few good movies being released because of lock downs I thought I would re-watch some of the movies that made me sit up and take notice when I was a bit younger. This is one of them.
It still has the wow experience and the adrenaline rush during the kitchen scene is still there. I'm amazed a film made so long ago is still this good. There were a few movies in the late 80s early 90s that did this including Raiders of The Lost Ark and The Matrix. Those movies that took you on a journey and made you feel as if you had just run a marathon, in a good way. Heart racing fear and subtle humour (still laugh at 'object in mirror are closer than it appears' perfect timing). It would be easy to pull certain things apart but it's a ride worth taking if you want to relive the original thrill.
Why don't we get movies like this anymore? So tired of the marvel Comics pumped up action heroes that are beyond reason and not relevant. Where are the action adventures? The movies that made us reach for the popcorn and settle in for a thrill ride? Humour seemed to be self deprecating then, not so in your face and at the expense of someone else as it is now.",

Seeing the dinosaur for the first time mixed with the great score is a magical feeling every time.

One surprise scene in particular continues to surprise and entertain me because it was so well done.

I always get a nostalgic feeling when I watch this movie as this spawned my love for dinosaurs. Now that I am grown up *somewhat* this movie is still one of my all time favs. I always find something new when watching it and always look forward to the scenes I remember. Spielberg has subtle changes from the original novel (omitting certain parts, changing the personality of characters, especially Dr. Grant) but is still true to the meat of the plot. From ""blood sucking lawyers,"" ""rock-star"" mathematicians, and stereotypical paleontologists, Spielberg created a movie that, to this day, still is one of the greatest of all time.

After Jurassic World, I want Colin Trevorrow should come back and make the perfect sequel, The Lost Kingdom: Jurassic World 2 with Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum. Then Stevie Spielberg should make the third one, Jurassic World 3: Extinction and get a new director to make the finale, Jurassic Park IV: Extinction Part II. Movies 5 and 6 need extended editions.

Whilst this is only my second full watch of this, I've watched so many halves and clips of this film that most of it is pretty much implanted in my brain. I think the main thing I love about this film, as it is with a lot of 80's and 90's classics, is its simplicity. It takes simple character dynamics and elevates them into a high-stakes scenario. Similarly to Back to the Future, every line of exposition towards the beginning is necessary at setting up a plot point or character arc. The build up is patient and allows us to get more time with this characters and to explore the park before everything goes wrong. The special effects are obviously legendary and still hold up incredibly well. Spielberg's direction is just phenomenal - the action scenes are shot in such a tense and engrossing way that I can't help but love them. The characters are iconic and all fulfil their roles within the story really well. John Williams' score is one of my all-time favourites, and overall, there isn't too much to say other than this truly is one of the best blockbusters of all time, and it will always be a personal favourite of mine just because of how much joy I get whilst watching it. It's very much a film that helped to ignite my love of cinema as a whole, and if for no reason other than that it will have a special place in my heart.",

899,9 July 2014,jwreid21-46-279281,10, My Favorite Scifi of all time,"Jurassic Park has a fantastic cast with Phenomenal acting. Not to mention the best CGI of its time, and it still holds its ground today. I am pulled right into the story with fear that dinosaurs are real, and that this is a possible scenario. It is not too often that I find a movie that I don't want to end. Jurassic Park holds on its own against the book, which is amazing as well. I am glad that Jurassic park was made in the 90's because if it were made today it may not have been as big of a wow factor, and the CGI wouldn't have as much nostalgia to it, as well as the puppetry. Watching it today it is not as convincing at times but the memories I hold from the movie overshadows its flaws. If you haven't seen it yet then what are you doing, get up and go watch it now!",

902,27 March 2019,tdsundberg,10, Jurassic Park 25 Years Later,Simply put: Jurassic Park continues to inform and educate viewers about the dangers of science and technology while at the same time providing a beautifully told story about a theme park with dinosaurs as the main attractions. Over 25 years later and the effects are still as realistic as the messages within the film! One of the best and my favorite movie of all time!,
903,14 September 2016,granttyabby,10, Great Movie!!,Jurassic Park is my favorite movie ever! Still to this day every time it is on I watch it! The realness of the dinosaurs is so incredible and flawless. They definitely picked a great cast for this movie! the science behind the creating of the dinosaurs is one of my favorite parts of the movie to be honest. The sick triceratops has to be the best part of the movie for me the detail in this scene is just so awesome. Jurassic Park has just the right amount of suspense and action. the T-Rex saving them from the raptors is the topping on the cake. for me this is one of the best movies ever made. and followed with great sequels. Would recommend this movie to everyone.,
904,29 December 2021,hannahroseimagery,6, Sooo boring...,"I felt like I was watching the discovery channel for the first hour or so. Maybe it doesn't help that I've never cared a shred about dinosaurs (and watched it for the first time as an adult). The next half hour was interesting, but it got so dumb that I was laughing my head off for the rest of it. And let me assure you, I don't usually laugh at violence or suspense. But the characters made such idiotic choices that it was really hard to have sympathy... not even Laura Dern could save the movie. The ending was a tad heartwarming. That's about it; 35 minutes or so of a good movie.",

I particularly enjoyed the t-rex and its antics. The cast was good as well. A good mix for a movie like this. The movie was quite entertaining, and when I first saw, it scary at moments. Those dinosaurs were very well made, pretty nice special effects for sure. The whole Spielberg style was really shown all over. I think the idea of a park with dinosaurs would be brilliant though. One good thing about a movie like this is that if this ever did happen, we would have far more park security for sure. None of these crap guns, but something much stronger. We cant have any dinosaurs eating people thats for sure. Well maybe some of the stupid people.",

And Steven Speilberg is a genius for this movie. While there are a lot of mistakes in some scenes, they're easily unnoticeable or can just be passed off, as the entire movie shines past it. I mean, how could you not enjoy dinosaurs coming to life on the big screen? Even if they are killing people, they're still fun. And for 1993, they looked great.

In 1993 Steven Spielberg blew the world away with groundbreaking CGI dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. Jurassic has intense moments with unforgettable characters and lines that are quoted time and time again. The basic premise is that a millionaire wants to open a theme park that features scientifically engineered dinosaurs, but before he can open it he needs to make sure it is safe so he brings a team to the island and it all goes to hell when the dinosaurs escape and run wild all over the park. This highly entertaining film is considered a classic and is up there in one of my favorites.",
910,13 February 2022,LloydChristmasss,10, Perfect movie,There will never be a better premise for a movie. Something that didn't exist before in our imaginations was invented from the DNA up. This is what movies were meant to be. Everything is undeniably amazing. The acting. The writing. The actors. The special effects. The cinematography. The jurassic park logo. The music. My mom took me to see this in the theater when It came out. I will always appreciate that. Movies today are plastic. Cheap cash grabs and woke diversity. Movie magic is dead. I'm always writing negitive reviews nowadays so I thought I'd express my opinion in a positive way at least once.,
911,4 May 2006,troza0,10, revolutionary,"I can't think of any dinosaur movie that can compare. Growing up with this movie, I can definitely remember the reaction to this movie made by the students of my school. Jurassic Park sprouted a deeper fascination of dinosaurs and prehistoric animals in general, which continues to this day. The only way that a dinosaur movie could compare with Jurassic Park is with our evolving modern technology of special effects. The Lost World was a good enough sequel to Jurassic Park and I imagine would have been hard to maintain the standards of Jurassic Park. However, Jurassic park 3 which was not directed by Steven Spielberg was a complete 'flop'. I hope that Jurassic Park 4 which I am hearing rumours about will redeem the Jurassic Park concept and creators.Other than that, bringing the concept of such a theme park to the big screen is super-sensational, and should be enough to deem Jurassic Park a modern-day classic.",

914,25 October 2014,rwzmjl1,3, Not Made to Last,"Jurassic Park doesn't hold up against the test of time. Looking back at the plot you realize there barely is one. The movie establishes a good premise early on, but it doesn't succeed in exploring the possibilities that come along with it. The movie is really just a vehicle for the idea behind it instead of having a plot that succeeds in reaching all opportunities that the premise allows. A great example of a movie that does this is The Truman Show. It was very original from the start and had a plot that helped its premise stretch its legs. Jurassic Park's creators' only objective was to make money off of the world they set up around the movie. Second after that in their mind was to make a good movie. Hey, at least the special effects were good (for the time).",
915,3 April 2006,merolico,10," ""Jrrasic Park "" (10STARS!!!!)",This was a great film. I give a two thumbs up to Steven Spielberg and his crew for turning the book written by Michael Crichton into to the big screen. This film is truly remarkable. This film gave all of us an idea of what dinosaurs were then back 65 million years ago and what would happen if Reptiles and Humans collide. the behind the scenes crew were great too! the dinosuars were very well detailed and looked absolutely real. Also Full credit to ILM for such an outsanding job with creating the dinosuars. The first time I saw the film and gazed the at the Beast's I was just dazzled. Five stars to Awrad-winning composer to John Williams. he is truly a very skilled man to composed and write such incredible scores and to have them in many other Big Hit Movies. Steven Spielberg really deserved the Best Director Award.,

I had to settle with seeing it on VHS and then on DVD. The first time i saw this movie, i knew this was the one that i could never stop watching.  I've seen this movie so many times.... and it keeps getting better! I don't think i really have to tell you the details of this movie because almost everyone in the world has seen it.  Not one of them i bet can say that they didn't enjoy it at least a little bit.  I mean the story, the action, the characters, the dinos.... just awesome!!!  Not to mention the fact that this movie has some of the greatest special effects ever.  Many of today's special f\x in movies can't compare to those in Jurassic Park. Steven Speilberg outdid himself with this one.  Sure, some people say that the movie didn't have any depth and not really any development.  I say.... who cares!!!!  It was a great action ride that sparked the 'computer-generated' era in movies. I loved that they made a second one, which im sorry to say didn't live up to the first one, but which sequel does?  I can't wait until the third one comes out.... and i'll be first in line to see it. If you haven't seen Jurassic Park, where have you been???

Not only do we get to see how this type of scenario might play out if it were to ever happen, but we get to see the interactions between human and dinosaur through a great reality of the best of our imaginations. This movie was exciting to watch the whole way through, and was a great example of how the playful concept of a dinosaur exhibit was totally crushed by their natural strength and dominance.",

Steven Spielberg made magic while directing this. anything less than stupendous is an understatement of the dinosaurs that Stan Winston and his crew made.if you have any interest in awesome effects, dinosaurs, awesome acting, and an astounding soundtrack you have to see this. The only thing that disappointed me was that it was not completely like the book. If I ever become a director(which would be sweet)i might remake this and make it exactly like the book. not sure if i could though. this movie is just so awesome. it might even be wrong to do a remake of this movie. its just so much of a classic. but then again, look at King Kong, also a great movie, the remake is better than the original. So to conclude if you have any taste in movies you will watch this. i bet you you will even watch this many times over like i have. and if you have not seen this movie yet, it has been out for 14 years. no offense but get with the times and watch this great groundbreaking movie. my only regret is that i didn't get to see this in the movie theaters.",

It created an era of the classic conception of looking at dinosaurs from a different lens. Previous films made by other directors were done with a casual bizarre conception of dinosaurs. I grew up having a passion for dinosaurs due to this movie. So far there has been no other director that has captured the essence of how dinosaurs were. Several people in archaeology attribute this film to the reason for their career. I attribute my appreciation of animal behavior to this film. The music by John Williams is fitting to the scenes.

The extremely convincing animatronic dinosaurs created for the film were combined and enhanced with groundbreaking, realistic CGI ones.

Meanwhile, in spite of the requisite Hollywood mistakes, many paleontologists and dinosaur fanatics also loved it.

The film had incredible special effects, but a movie cannot make it on special effects alone. The plot of this movie really carried the special effects. Most of the time it's the other way around. The plot stuck very closely to the book except for a couple of character issues. People got to see dinosaurs not just as giant lizard monsters but as living surviving animals. Ive read that there wasn't much character development. There was some development, but the development wasn't supposed to be on the characters it was supposed to be on cloning and the dinosaurs. The acting was very good, especially characters such as Ian Malcolm and Alan Grant. Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum did very good jobs of displaying these characters. Also, the late Bob Peck who was Robert Muldoon in the film gave incredible intensity to his character. For people who have forgotten the main plot, this movie is about a rich entrepreneur named John Hammond who has cloned dinosaurs and has built a tourist park on a remote island of the coast of Costa Rica.

My Favorite scene is when Jeff goldblume gets out of his car with the flame to move the t~Rex away from the kids is my favorite. ""Ian Freeze!"" What a classic line. The cover alone for the movie is great, the cg is the best, and the music is so epic! The second movie wasn't bad either to be honest, although it wasn't anything like the book. The third one sucked, but the first one, was the best, i really hope they continue to make a fourth, it's rumored their bringing back the original cast, and Vince Vaughn, which would be awesome. I spend hours in Orlando in Jurassic Park, they should build a theme park, bigger then Disney world, Dino's behind cages, electronic of course, and like tons of rides, it would be awesome, if you've never seen this movie, put this computer down right now, and watch it!",

It is one of the best movies that was made in the 90s and i also love the Jurassic park novel. The soundtrack is nostalgic. Espessially when we see the brachiosaurus enter the screen. And the opening scene is one epic shot with the raptor killing the worker off screen. Steven speilberg knows what a good movie is. The way he made the T-rex breakout scene is legendary. The fact that in that scene, there is no music, only the sound of rain and the T-rex walking and roaring. I love the small details he made during the movie. For example the fence scene when Tim gets shocked, we can see his hair stand up like it really happened. Steven Spielberg is one of the best director ever.",
942,22 March 2020,IreneWatsonC,9, SCIENCE,"Due to the high development of technology, the movie used a lot of computer special effects. But Spielberg even used the genetic engineering of dinosaurs to raise questions about modern science: can science make human beings think they are the masters of the world and can dominate and surpass nature? The director's answer, of course, is no. It can be seen that this reflects the modern western understanding of the limitations of science after the reflection on science since the 20th century. Science cannot be an excuse for human hubris. However, this does not affect the greatness of science. After all, because of the development of science, we can see the dinosaurs in the movie.",
943,18 April 2023,p-00296,10, MAGICAL,This movie is the greatest film of all time due to how magical it truly is. Im pretty sure no one person forgets seeing Jurassic park for the first time. A good amount of movies from the 20th century become dated but Jurassic park is timeless. Modern cgi blockbusters dont hold a candle to the first heavy cgi blockbuster. The acting in this film is amazing because all those actors make you Believe that there is a dinosaur eating off a tree infront of them. These actors are the very first to react to nothing for a film. So when i watch this film i think to myself that this is a very important step for film because without this movie there is no lord of the rings or infinity war. This movie even has a great story about how even if we can do it maybe we shouldnt do it. This message is just the structure for the rest of the movie which is about bio engineering and the effects of it. John Williams score is iconic and without the score this would be a lesser film. The music captures awe yet fear. When you hear that main theme play while a dinosaur walks by everyone is in awe. When the raptors escape it plays a intense piece of music cause terror of what is going to happen. The characters are also amazing. John Hammonds character arc may be the best in the movie due to him pushes for Jurassic park opening but as his creations escape he then realizes he was doing wrong by making these creatures. This movie is so magical a true masterpiece of film.,

951,20 June 2013,dayman792,10, A movie that will stay with you forever..,I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was like 9 years old. I was obsessed with dinosaurs at the time so when I finally saw the movie it just blew me away. I'm 20 now and whenever I hear that beautiful main theme by John Williams it literally gives my goosebumps every time. After so many years it has become a stellar part of my childhood. The concept of having dinosaurs interact with humans is a brilliant idea. And the execution by Spielberg is just phenomenal. I don't care if the movie is scientifically incorrect in the way they bring the dinosaurs back to life. It's about the experience. Just imagine they could. ,
952,6 February 2005,sketch_09,9," One of the most well crafted sci fi flicks in the history of cinema, and not just because of the special effects.","A lot of people degrade this film my saying it has bad acting and a bad screenplay. I tell you what, it's far better than a lot of action adventures before and after it.",
953,26 December 2003,mr_whud,10, This movie belongs in the IMDB top 250,"This has always been my favorite film, ever since I was 8 or 9 years old. The special effects are, of course, among the best ever in any film. The script is intelligently written, the characters are colorful and interesting, the pace is ultra-fast, the music is phenomenal, the action is suspenseful and unpredictable, and the ending is, in my opinion, wicked cool. I don't see why garbage like Annie Hall and Platoon is in the top 250 but masterpieces like this aren't.",
954,7 August 2020,alexbogue3889,10, Totally awesome!,"I was only 4 years old when this movie originally hit the big screen. I was too little to go see it in theaters, but I watched it on VHS when it came out. I am probably one of the few little kids never to be phased by screaming dinosaurs. I could eat popcorn no problem.",
955,20 September 2006,BenKenobi2007,10, Groundbreaking!,"Steven Spielberg has made yet another masterpiece, this film which has groundbreaking special effects, a great cast and an amazing score revolutionised film making. Jurassic Park stars Sam Neill Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough. The story starts with John Hammond (Attenborough) opening a park for genetically recreated Dinosaurs and he invites paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill) & Paleobotonis Ellie Sttler (Laura Dern) as well as Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and expert in Chaos Therory to view the park, needless to say the Dinosaurs get loose and all hell breaks loose. Jurassic Park had amazing special effects which can still compare to todays & this film paved the way for special effects for such films as ""Spiderman"" & ""The Day After Tomorrow"". I give Jurassic Park 8/10",
956,13 July 2005,michaeloldfield,3," Good thing this film had some dinosaurs in it, otherwise what a bore.","Am I the only one in the world who is disturbed by glaring continuity mistakes? And this film has two of the biggest I've ever seen. I've heard Spielberg doesn't care about continuity, and if this film is an example, then it's true. Firstly, on the helicopter trip to the island, old man Hammond is sitting with his back to the front of the helicopter. You can clearly see the water going by outside. And yet he gestures in front of him ""and there it is"" or whatever he says, but he's pointing in front of himself. No. Wrong. The island should be BEHIND him. Secondly, and this is just stupid. When we first see the T-Rex enclosure, the cars are on the same level as the enclosure. They are clearly looking straight across at it. Later when T-Rex escapes, he/she walks straight across to the cars from the enclosure, so far so good but...When T-Rex knocks the car off the edge of the road...WHAT EDGE OF THE ROAD?! Was there a landslide that wasn't shown? Did one half of the island sink thirty metres? This is ridiculous, and totally unnecessary. A dinosaur attack would be exciting enough, one would imagine, without being knocked off the edge of a cliff (or whatever it is) that doesn't exist. Also, with the exception of Bob Peck, all the actors are really phoning this one in. I mean come on.",
957,19 June 2011,greene_2006,9, Jurassic park,"This action packed film was one of the first of its kind that showed great detail and the look of what the ""future"" could hold. The location of where this film was to take place is off a secluded island in Costa Rica. This isolated island (Jurassic Park) was the home of prehistoric dinosaurs that were brought back into present time by ""dino blood"" that was preserved from insects that existed in that time period. The main characters that were visitors of Jurassic Park are the following: Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Tim Murphy (Joseph Mazzello), Lex Murphy (Ariana Richards), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck). These seven characters listed above endure many obstacles and not all of them make it off the island alive. The founder of Jurassic Park is John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) and he explains the process of how these extinct animals are brought back into the ""modern world"". The theme for this film in my opinion is that technological advances may unlock many unanswered questions about our past; however some answers should be left unknown. ",
958,8 August 2013,damein2612,9, great movie,"In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.",
959,7 February 2019,ironcraftleague,9, The original childhood classic and blockbuster movie.,"What can I say about this movie that was already said? It's CGI is revolutionary for the time and the characters are memorable. It was scary, exhilarating, suspenseful, awesome, and all around a super fun movie. The animatronics and everyone's performance really add to this movie, the scene with the T. Rex breaking the glass is pretty cool and awesome. However, I'd be lying if this was a perfect movie. Something feel off like certain scenes with Dr. Malcom or the dinosaurs. Like sometimes I feel the dinosaurs aren't there, and sometimes that's disappointing. Dr. Malcom was also a little unintentionaly awkward when it wasn't the intended effect. However, it was a VERY AWESOME movie besides that. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good blockbuster. Loved this film as a kid, love it still now. 9/10.",
960,1 August 2022,prudhoeboy,10, Carbon Footprint,"Humans risk losing their position at the top of the food chain in this movie adaptation of Michael Crichton's 1990 sci fi novel. Director Steven Spielberg removes any doubt that he is the successor to Irwin Allen of the disaster film genre so popular in the 1970s. Moreover, his first disaster film, Jaws (1975), made him a contemporary of Irwin Allen! Allen pioneered the genre and covered more disaster types. Taking up the mantle as a young film maker, Spielberg created a multi-level marketing franchise with sequels and theme park rides. I don't have much more to add to what has already been said in other reviews. The movie has a great false premise ready to crash down for us on the screen with a truly delusional proponent - an eccentric, grandfatherly entrepreneur. Cracks begin to form early when Malcom (Jeff Goldblum), a mathematician in a tour group of experts brought in to evaluate the park questions the wisdom and safety of the old man's idea. The casting was spot on with loser Seinfeld postman Nyder as the weak brick in the dam. Animation and special effects of the dinosaurs quite good. As with Jaws, food chain flipped. Movie also solutes the classic B movie genre where monsters fight it out at the end over who eats victim. What is singular in this movie, however, is that the proponent of the bad idea, the theme park creator, does not go down with his creations. Both live on so we have see the sequel. Takeaway from movie: Just as an asteroid wiped out the scary dinosaurs 66 million years ago, giving rise to mammals and eventually humans, misuse of high technology could wipe out humans.",
961,22 December 2008,pgwhite95,8, Imagination is still important!,"I recently watched this film again after not seeing it for a few years, and I still can't believe how captivated I am. Every aspect of this film keeps you interested in what's going to happen next, from the intro-scene where the two title characters are digging up fossils, to the ending-scene where they are flying away over the ocean, I love this movie with absolute certainty.",

964,8 November 2005,ihateleo,9, Still As Relevant As Ever.(May Contain Spoilers),"The first film to modernize and embellish digital fx, Jurassic Park was ahead of its time and is still a revered film.A Paleoentologist and a Paleobotanist are given the opportunity to embark with an eccentric visionary to a one of a kind island to give an endorsement. With the discovery of Mr. Hammond's fantastical new dream made a bold reality, things go awry when a sabotage occurs and the prehistoric beasts run amok restoring them to their primal state.The point being that nothing can contain that which is inherently wild, therefore teaching arrogant men not to tamper with nature's delicate balance. While it may be disguised as a 'summer blockbuster' what lies within Jurassic Park is a testament for those willing to look.It makes its point with plenty of action and terrific visuals to boast.Watch for Richard Attenborough's poetic speech about the illusion of creation and control.The juxtaposition of man and dinosaur being a scathing parable for all that would wish to create something as defiant and new as Hammond's genetic monstrosities.Both beautiful and frightful, the dinosaurs serve as a warning for mankind to know his balance.With a perfect cast and a truly original story, the film never feels tired or redundant.Spielberg has not made a film of this caliber since.",
965,8 May 2019,simonheranig,7," Great Idea, but not got the most out of it","THe idea of the way of bringing dinosaurs back from extinction is great and also of the Park, how it operates. The whole movie was actually consistently exciting concerning all what happened. So definitely entertaining. Some scenes and especially the characters were admittedly stereotyped, but Not in a negative way. The plot was obviously too minimalistic to my liking and a bit more background information would have been better. According to Dennis Nedry who accepted a bribe by an apparent competitor of John Hammond. The question is: Who was this man and what exactly were his plans? What did he want to achieve with these stolen Embryos of Dinosaurs? Me personally, I lack this in the movie.",
966,9 December 2008,anchoreddown,10, simply a blockbuster classic,Who doesn't remember growing up watching the JP movies??? The second one was just as good as the first. ,
967,30 March 2001,Gryosphere,10, Greatest movie of all time!!!,"Jurassic Park, is probably the greatest movie ever created, in my opinion. It was well planed out, and the dinosaurs were magnificant. I have never seen a better movie than this. The Lost World: Jurassic Park was a very good sequel to Jurassic Park, and Jurassic Park III looks to be maybe the best of them all. Sam Neill returns as Dr. Alan Grant, but this time he will be visiting Isla Sorna and not Isla Nublar. The new main dinosaur the Spinosaurus looks to be VERY awesome! Jurassic Park III may be the event hit of the summer. I am looking very forward to it. Also, I can't wait to see the trailer for it on May 4. But, July 18 will be the biggest day of the year 2001. Everybody go see Jurassic Park III. It will be GREAT!!!",
968,9 August 2004,sergeantJatwork,10, Dreamy...,"""Jurassic Park"" was great. I watch it over and over. I believe it intensifies our imaginations. What if we could bring back something that's been gone for centuries? What if dinosaurs were alive today? The graphics were great. Everything was shown so vivid and yet left so much to the imagination. The actors did a wonderful job portraying their characters. Their emotions were very emotional and on cue. If I wasn't seeing it on the screen than I wouldn't know they were just acting. ""Jurassic Park"" sent all sorts of emotions my way. Scary, thrilling, awed, funny, and all around amazed. I give all involved with this movie a standing ovation. Everyone did their part and in doing so created a movie I could sit and watch everyday.",
969,27 November 2006,TheTitaniumDragon,10, One of the best movies ever,"Jurassic Park is an amazing movie. The plot is excellent and it is extremely well executed. Though made in 1993, the mixture of computer graphics and animatronics with the dinosaurs makes the dinosaurs all appear to be extremely lifelike; the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the Velociraptors are gorgeous and look like they're real. This feat has not really been equaled since, and only the Jurassic Park series manage to pull it off. In many years, this movie will be seen as the first movie to pull off its special effects so convincingly.",
970,13 February 2015,u_will_beg_too_me,10, Best dinosaur movie ever,"This movie has everything, from dinosaurs to humor. Great actors and really good cgi/non cgi effects. Its okay to watch this movie with kids and older peoples. The whole world will change you when you watch this first time, because let's face it dinosaurs doesn't exist. The best thing about the movie is the dinosaurs, because that is what this movie are about. There might be some humans in it, but don't care about them. All the energy should be directed to the dinosaurs and not the humans, because you can just go down to the store and watch peoples. There is this human with a hat and human with glasses which tries to throw a flare away from a t-Rex which did not succeed and the t-Rex got mad as **** and started to run after the human. Now this is a great movie.",
971,27 January 2005,kiss_me_angel2003,10, What I think of Jurassic Park,"The first time I saw Jurassic park, I was only eight. Quite frankly, I had NO want to watch scary dinosaurs eat people or chase people. I had nightmares for WEEKS. But la-di-da-ing through channels, I stopped on it one day a while ago. 'Holy CATS!' I exclaimed, 'They still have this movie?!' ",
