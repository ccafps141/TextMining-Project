0,14 June 2006,bkoganbing,10," ""I've Decided to Take My Doctor's Advice, I'm going to become a mensch.""","In the recent biography of Billy Wilder by Ed Sikov, it is mentioned that for the first time Wilder used as his protagonist a lovable loser. Think about it. In a whole lot of his previous films the main lead in Ace in the Hole, Double Indemnity, Stalag 17 are the people who are the takers as Shirley MacLaine describes Fred MacMurray here.",/
1,28 June 2001,moonspinner55,10," Likewise, it's a love-fest Lemmon-wise","One of the finest examples of smart, satiric comedy-drama ever created for the screen. Jack Lemmon (in amazing comic form) plays a working stiff in Corporate America--via New York City--whose bachelor apartment inadvertently becomes a love-nest for amorous, married executives. The film is extremely modern for 1960 and features a non-stop barrage of funny, clever talk. Lemmon is a mad genius at frenzied (yet sympathetic) characterization, and ""The Apartment"" catches him at his professional peak in the movies. Working alongside huggable neurotic Shirley MacLaine (also at her peak) and shady Fred MacMurray (parlaying his slimeball role with curt persuasion), Lemmon creates a new kind of acting: screwball realism. **** from ****",r
2,21 January 2005,davidals,10, Becoming A Mensch,"Ohhh - after my 4th or 5th viewing, I think this may be one of the most remarkable blends of comedy and drama to have ever been filmed - THE APARTMENT - in subtle ways - rises well above the conventions of any genre. It was my introduction to the great Billy Wilder, and my fondness for Jack Lemmon (a remarkable and sorely missed actor) begins here as well.",e
3,24 March 2002,gaityr,10, That's the way it crumbles...,"What a wonderful way to spend an evening--dinner, Christmas and New Year's with CC Baxter (Jack Lemmon) and 'friends', accompanied by much champagne and laughter, and spaghetti and meatballs lovingly prepared by the host himself. There's even a game of gin rummy to get into that Baxter and Fran can't ever seem to finish--here's hoping it never does!",v
4,24 May 2001,KatMiss,10, WILDER'S GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT,"Billy Wilder's ""The Apartment is his greatest accomplishment. It is his most successful melding of comedy and drama that he never quite pulled off again. I'm glad the Academy had enough good taste to award Wilder The Triple Crown: Best Picture/Director/Screenplay. But they still had enough bad taste to deny Jack Lemmon a Best Actor award, Shirley MacLaine a Best Actress award and Fred MacMurray a nomination and award.",i

6,15 June 2011,markdroulston,9, They don't make 'em like this anymore,"Billy Wilder's The Apartment was one of a huge list of movies that are considered classics which I haven't seen, and indeed knew very little about (other than the level of admiration which many people have for it). Having a vague knowledge of the stars of the film (Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine), for one reason or another I was expecting a light-hearted comedy filled with innuendo and witty banter, a tradition of filmmaking that was common around the period when this film was released. Thankfully I wasn't disappointed, as these elements are all in play in The Apartment, but what really thrilled and surprised me was the much more serious subject matter that the film deals with. To say this is simply a comedy is completely false, as it's a somewhat dark and daring study of the nature of love and infidelity, and the stunning performances and filmmaking on display had me enthralled from the first frame.",w
7,15 October 2004,cwelty1,10," A rare gem, this is a blessedly adult comedy with great performances, great writing and the kind of depth hardly ever seen in the more vapid, formulaic romantic comedies of today.","Written by the great filmmaker Billy Wilder, this is a serious, sardonic comedy for people who've known what's its like to feel the pressure of compromising your principles or your self- respect for the sake of getting ahead in life. And there are very few over the age of consent who haven't had to at one time or another. This isn't the laugh out loud comedy of Jim Carrey or the Farrelly brothers, but a subtle, nuanced comedy about two people who have both been jaded in love and yet continue to hope again and again that it will someday work out for them -- mainly because despite the unlikeable things they do, they are both basically decent, nice people. Flawed and even weak at times, but good people. This is a movie that doesn't just make it you laugh, it makes you think. A rare find indeed.",/

9,22 October 2006,claudio_carvalho,10, One of the Most Delightful Movies of Hollywood,"On 01 November 1959, in New York, C.C. ""Bud"" Baxter (Jack Lemon) is a popular clerk of ""Consolidate Life"", an insurance company with 31,259 employees. The secret of his success is a well located apartment where he lives that he sublets for his superiors, making him climb to the executive position of 2nd Administrative Assistant very early. He likes the elevator girl Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), a reserved woman considered a ""jackpot"" among the executives. Fran is the secret lover of the director Jeff D. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray), a married man that seduced her convincing that he will divorce his wife to stay with her. When Fran tries to commit suicide in Baxter's apartment after a meeting with Jeff, she stays with Baxter while recovering, and he falls in love for her. Later he has to come up to a decision between his excellent position in the company and his love.",w
10,1 May 2006,jdoan-4,9, A precise satire,"Billy Wilder has made some tremendous satires. ""Sunset Boulevard"" is one of the greatest satires on film. ""The Apartment"", though not as cynical, is a very good one as well. I like that the satire is a backdrop for the main love story, and yet an integral part of it. The film shows just how much people are will to prostitute themselves in order to get what they want, whether that be a family or an executive office. Wilder handles some very serious and bawdy themes with a precise touch. This film could have easily turned into a wacky comedy of errors, but he is much to talented and sympathetic for that. He gives Baxter's character some sincere emotional depth. I could almost feel his loneliness and longing in many scenes. He is never really sure what he wants and how he can get it. He is a man searching for something, and he doesn't quite know it. Lemon plays this role to perfection. He doesn't go overboard. He gives the character the right amount of silliness and charm. McClaine is very strong. Her character is not stereotyped. She is a wounded soul that is looking for respite in the absolutely wrong place. I found her very charming and lovable. Some much of the film is in the wonderful cinematography. Wilder uses the widescreen to its fullest capability. The framing is so precise. You get a feeling of utter separation and distance. I really like the nearly infinite succession of desks in the office.",6
11,28 March 2022,BandSAboutMovies,10, The Apartment,"The Apartment is astounding because it makes me consider how we view actors based on where we arrive in reality. For me, Fred McMurray is the kind Steve Douglas from TV's My Three Sons. For those born before 1960, they probably saw him on that show and wondered how the heel from Double Indemnity and The Caine Mutiny could be trusted around three growing children.",3
12,27 July 2017,JohnHowardReid,10, Deserved all its awards!,"In many ways, the best of Wilder's comedies and of Lemmon's performances, and by any standards one of the best films of its period. Scene after scene is worked out in terms that are both moving and funny, as when Lemmon tries to cheer MacLaine with such housekeeping tricks as straining the spaghetti with a tennis racket (""You should see me serve the meat balls!"") or the ending with the build-up of the run along the street turned into a laugh by the shot of Lemmon standing with the champagne pouring over his hand.",1

14,19 November 2022,marcelbenoitdeux,10," Sweet and Sour, Wilder Style","Certain films travel in time, undisturbed. Always relevant. ""The Apartment"" is such a film. Jack Lemmon at the top of his form and the luminous Shirley MacLaine at the center of this bitter romantic comedy. The cynics with the keys and the ambition are also the corruptors of the little man. The ones dangling the golden carrot. Billy Wilder finds a way out, where love, if not triumphs, survives. Fred MacMurray is a surprisingly believable corruptor, living a socially acceptable life, at least on the surface. The laughs are well earned but with that Wilderian aftertaste that makes ""The Apartment"" a unique piece of film art.",7
15,24 July 2015,AlsExGal,8," It's lost a step over time, but still satisfies even if it does not surprise","This film was groundbreaking in the sense that it dealt with sexual harassment in the workplace in a way that was quite realistic for 1960. All the women are in menial jobs at the insurance company where Jack Lemmon's character works, and all of the executives are men. The executives look at their female workforce as one big harem and won't let a little thing like the fact that they are married and intend to stay that way interfere with their stepping out from time to time. This is where C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) comes in. He trades the use of his apartment to these executives in return for promotions and perks. However, Baxter has an attack of conscience when he comes face-to-face with the collateral damage that one of these executives is doing in the person of Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine). Fran, the elevator operator, has just found out she is one of many affairs for big boss Mr. Sheldrake (Fred McMurray), whom she genuinely loves, and when she and Sheldrake quarrel in Baxter's apartment and Sheldrake leaves her some money for her troubles, unintentionally making her feel even cheaper than she already feels she swallows a bottle of sleeping pills hoping not to wake up, slipping into a coma on Baxter's bed.",9
16,4 October 2001,MotoMike,10, A masterpiece,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Anyone that knows about comedy knows about ""Some Like It Hot"", and anyone that know about ""Some Like It Hot"" knows about Billy Wilder. This was his next film, and the reason I mention that is that this is a serious and melancholy drama with the form and rhythm of comedy. But it's not a funny movie, and part of the genius of the writing and direction is that Lemmon's character especially only figures this out in the third act.",4
17,7 September 2004,RanchoTuVu,9, corporate sex ladder,"A struggling office worker in a giant insurance company lends his apartment to higher ups in order to get a promotion. Set during the Holidays, the theme of infidelity turned a lot of viewers off. The Holiday setting however is what provides a lot of the film's best scenes, as in the fantastic office Christmas party where the secretaries are doing a CanCan on the table and couples are making out in the corner. The one-two punch of Jack Lemmon's classic performance and that of Fred MacMurray is fabulous, and the triangle of sorts that forms with Shirley McClaine makes this much more than the comedy that it is known for.",/
18,27 October 2006,Det_McNulty,10," One Of the Finest Scripts Ever Written, and Jack Lemmon Creates One Of The Greatest Character Performances As The Wonderful C.C. Baxter","For me Billy Wilder has always been one of my all time favourite directors and he has not made a single film that has not appealed to me. Billy Wilder sums up perfection all his films manage to succeed in what they set out to do. Billy Wilder is not just one of the greatest directors; he is also one of the finest scriptwriters ever. Creating flowing dialogue like no other and perfectly making his actors and actresses work with the script brilliantly. Billy Wilder has made dark noirs, hilarious musicals and studies of human nature. It is extremely difficult to fully describe a director as versatile and genius as Billy Wilder. His films have held up for generations and will continue to have the same mass appeal that his films have had since their opening days.",?

21,3 March 2013,barryrd,9, Bosses and employees conflict in a New York insurance company,"The Apartment is a story that sparkles with a scintillating script, humour, and interesting characters as employees of a large insurance company come into conflict with each other. The story set in mid-20th century Manhattan is considered a ""classic"". The acting, the mix of characters and script are outstanding. New York City, 1959 is written all over it. The bar scenes, the office Christmas party, the walk-up apartment on the Upper West Side, the White Plains home of one of the executives all evoke the era. ",f

23,21 September 2005,film-critic,10, ...and then one day I saw a footprint in the sand and there you were.,"I would first like to make the comment that this is no comedy. For those that consider this film a valuable part of Hollywood cinema due to the comedic aspects need to get their eyes examined along with their minds. I do not think that I laughed at all during this film, but I would like to mention that I do not think that is a bad thing. Not laughing at this film means that it hit you at a different level. I witnessed a beautiful film with some highly intelligent actors painting a dark and disturbing picture of a sexual world circa 1960. I suppose I was thinking that this was going to be a ""screwball"" comedy, which completely threw me off balance when the events of this film occurred. Never have I witnessed such a bold attack on the sexual revolution of the 60s and its effect on the business world. It was a slap in the face to see the way that Billy Wilder represented corporate America and honestly, it felt really good. To see this lonely man turned away from his apartment at all hours of the night because his boss needed a place to take their mistresses was sad, not funny, yet in The Apartment it worked beautifully.",=
24,8 January 2008,pyrocitor,9, Surprisingly downbeat but ultimately rewarding comic drama,"In an age of cinema thriving on relatively simple black and white tales of right and wrong, director Billy Wilder had always stood out as daring to recognize the ambiguity in characters and situations, making his films more difficult to classify than those of his contemporaries. And while Wilder's follow up to the tremendously successful Some Like It Hot may be visually black and white (the last best picture winner in over thirty years made without colour) its classification is far more elusive than such simplistic terms. Part corporate satire, part character study, part societal critique, part comedy, part tragedy, all melding together for a superbly emotionally affecting effort , The Apartment proves to be one of Wilder's finest works in a career inundated with tremendous successes. ",t
25,1 October 2008,planktonrules,9," Not at all a comedy, but still a fine picture","Over the years, I have heard that THE APARTMENT was a comedy, however I really saw nothing particularly funny about the film.

27,29 December 2010,Boba_Fett1138,8, Amusing and charming movie.,This is not an exaggerated or over-the-top screwball comedy but more one that amuses with its cute story and characters. This all is also where the movie is getting its charm from. ,u
28,27 July 2020,MissSimonetta,10, Maybe the most serious comedy of all time,"THE APARTMENT is technically a comedy, but the material is so bleak and dark, that sometimes it's hard to laugh at the human misery on display. That's not to say there is nothing funny-- Jack Lemmon's drunken dancing at a bar on Christmas Eve had me chuckling, as did his attempt to watch TV while consuming a not-so-appealing TV dinner-- but by and large, this is as cynical as satire gets in so many ways. Lemmon and Maclaine's characters essentially prostitute themselves (figuratively and literally) in the hopes of getting ahead or fighting off loneliness, only to be kicked down again and again by life and other people.",r
29,10 November 2022,I_Ailurophile,9," A superb classic, smarter and sharper than it first looks and more so than most possible comparisons","This is definitely not the movie I was expecting when I first sat to watch. My first impression wasn't the strongest, and I was prepared to say this doesn't strike quite the same chord with me as it has with so many other viewers. Even at that, I'd have said that for the space it plays in, it does so better than almost any other point of comparison. Heading into the second hour, however, the film takes a turn, both in terms of content and quality. Ostensibly a romantic comedy-drama, the meaningful romantic element is very gradual, and rather oblique; the flourishes of comedy are decidedly adult, but smarter than any humor in most any similar title to have followed in subsequent years; the drama is extra cold, and unexpectedly dark. In fact, 'The apartment' increasingly becomes downright grim as protagonist Baxter reaps the consequences of the boorish seeds he has sown in the very deep hole he has dug for himself. I suppose this shouldn't come as too much of a surprise coming from the filmmaker who gave us 'Sunset Boulevard' and 'Ace in the hole,' yet by Jove, this is terrific, and more of a wild ride than some abject thrillers or action flicks could claim.",v

Jack Lemmon is superb as C.C. Baxter, the meek corporate worker who loans his apartment out to co-workers so they can spend alone time with their mistresses. In exchange for his services, Baxter is rewarded with high praise and before he knows it he is climbing the corporate ladder to success.",

Loneliness and love have resisted to a business greed and a loose moral. Mr. Wilder has filled delicious humor with a sentimental and melancholic tone.",
32,25 July 2007,jzappa,10, He Puts Up With A Lot,"The Apartment does what most love stories and perhaps no romantic comedies do, which makes it as emotionally stirring as it is. It has one person in deep emotional trouble because she's in love with someone else, and the other person is hopeless in love with her, and not only that, walked on by everyone constantly. And frankly, you really tend to care a great deal, because the film spares us nothing and really holds back on offering us relief until the last few minutes.",
33,13 January 1999,DukeofPearl,10, The definitive movie for the comedy/drama genre,"Billy Wilder's ""The Apartment"" is a film which can produce some of the biggest laughs and at the same time... can bring many viewers to tears, Billy Wilder's quaint little tale about everyday people who get tangled up in love, jealousy and infidelity boasts a top-notch cast led by the trio of Lemmon, MacLaine and MacMurray who are tremendous. The plot revolves around C.C. (Lemmon) who unknowingly makes the unethical attempt of climbing the corporate ladder by 'loaning' his apartment to members from his management chain to entertain their 'women on the side'. Given the change of circumstances, this premise certainly could even hit home in the current office environment. Although the office party and secretarial gossip scenes could be viewed as dated, the power and attitude of the corporate executive, Mr. Sheldrake (MacMurray) is certainly symbolic. The character of Fran (MacLaine) for today's standards of course seems too submissive and vulnerable but the reward of her finding true, admirable, unconditional companionship is quite enriching and fulfilling to any who see this memorable film.",
34,28 September 2013,freemantle_uk,9, A classic comedy-drama,"Billy Wilder is one of the most highly regarded directors of his generation and The Apartment is one of his most acclaimed films. The Apartment is a funny and dramatic, aimed with a script that is witty and tragic. Both Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine have great chemistry and give great performances, Lemmon giving a nervous energy to his character, a little like Woody Allen but much less self-obsessed whilst MacLaine has plenty of charm and wit, but also has tragedy about her. The comedy is gentle amidst the controversial material for the time, filled with witty lines, character interactions and subtle sight gags. We get plenty of melodrama and the characters go through typical arcs, but the screenplay is so well written and the direction and acting that it makes The Apartment a rewarding experience, even during its darkest moments.",

37,19 June 2018,ferbs54,10, One Of My All-Time Favorite Films...Laughswise And Feelingswise,"After Billy Wilder came out with his hysterically funny and now-classic ""Some Like It Hot"" in 1959, many wondered how he could possibly top this truly inspired effort. The film had come at the tail end of a remarkable decade for the director; a decade that saw him come out with such films as ""Sunset Blvd.,"" ""Ace in the Hole,"" ""Stalag 17,"" ""Sabrina,"" ""The Seven Year Itch"" (one of his weakest films, sez me, but nevertheless highly popular, mainly due to Marilyn Monroe's iconic performance) and ""Witness for the Prosecution."" But as the new decade began (well, on June 15, 1960, anyway), Wilder stunned everyone by delivering a film that was perhaps the best he had ever done: the 1960 Best Picture Oscar winner ""The Apartment."" I first saw this film in the mid-'70s, at the now defunct Regency Theater on Broadway and 66th St., and for me, it was love at first watch. Since that evening, I have seen the film so many times that I could not even properly estimate the number, but it has to be at least 25, and most of those watches have been on the big screen. It is a film that never seems to grow old for me, dated as it might be in parts. I love every little bit of this movie, featuring as it does career-best performances by stars Jack Lemmon (OK, Lemmon would be better dramatically a few years later in ""Days of Wine and Roses"") and Shirley MacLaine, and an uncharacteristically cadlike role for the great Fred MacMurray (a last-minute replacement after Paul Douglas passed away). And, oh, that script...that wonderful script!",

41,5 January 2020,gab-14712,9, Billy Wilder At His Finest!,"1960’s The Apartment is one of the better, more realistic films of the early 1960’s. It’s a timely, sharp film that features classic director Billy Wilder at his best. This film focuses on the theme of adultery, which was still a subject that many filmgoers did not take lightly. In fact, Fred MacMurray claimed that women would accost him in the street and disapproved of his performance. That said, contemporary critics call this film a masterpiece and I would be inclined to agree. The film, while timely and often sardonic, infuses a mixture of wry humor and a hint of sadness to make this a film you can never forget. There are actually people out there who believe this is a good holiday movie because of its setting, but I’m not entirely sure about that. ",
42,19 October 2016,Tweekums,9, What a romantic comedy should be,"Calvin Clifford (C. C.) ""Bud"" Baxter is a drone working at a massive New York insurance company; he has a plan to ingratiate himself with his seniors though; he lets four of them use his apartment for their illicit meetings with their mistresses. This is rather exhausting for Baxter as he is stuck waiting in the cold for them to leave it also leads his neighbours to believe that he is a womaniser. The scheme seems to work though as he is promoted unfortunately the main reason seems to be that his new boss, Jeff Sheldrake, also wants to use the apartment. Feeling buoyed up by his promotion he plucks up courage to invite attractive elevator girl Fran Kubelik out on a date; she says she has a prior commitment early on but agrees to see a show with him it turns out her prior commitment was an assignation with Mr Sheldrake. Sheldrake convinces her that he is starting divorce proceedings against his wife so she agrees to stand up her date and goes to 'the apartment' with Sheldrake. Sometime later she learns that Sheldrake has a history of such behaviour but always returns to his with and family. She confronts him in Baxter's apartment and realises that he has no intention of leaving his wife. Meanwhile Baxter, having learnt that Fran is seeing Sheldrake gets drunk and picks up another woman. The evening doesn't end as expected though; when he gets home he discovers Fran lying in his bed having taken an overdose of sleeping pills. He quickly gets rid of his date and seeks help from the doctor who lives next door. They save Fran but Baxter's attempts to protect his boss's reputation make him seem a real cad to his neighbours.",

45,27 July 2007,writers_reign,10, - Wise Guys,"This is as close as makes no difference to the very best of Billy Wilder and that is, essentially, the Best of the Best. We'd be here all day if I were to list EVERY great Wilder film but the majority are great on one level - Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Ace In The Hole, Sunset Boulevard, great Drams all; Some Like It Hot, The Major And The Minor, A Foreign Affair, One, Two, Three, great comedies, but with The Apartment Wilder moves effortlessly from satire (the four wise guys who monopolise the apartment and see everything as corporate-wise, situation-wise, promotion-wise, Kubelik-wise etc). through comedy to drama without missing a beat. The writing is breathtaking and coupled brilliantly to visuals that move the story along like the cracked compact mirror and Wilder isn't afraid to give the most minor character a good line - witness the Santa in the bar who walks into the scene and says 'my sleigh is double-parked' and later, when the bartender is waiting to close and asks if the drunk realizes what night it is he replies 'I work for the outfit'. In the same scene, of course, is another fully realized character, Margie, whose jockey husband is in gaol in Havana for doping horses. Virtually everyone puts in top-of-the-line performances (even Shirley MacLaine is not as hard to take as usual) from the four horsemen of Baxter's apocalypse to Edie Adams, to Fred McMurray, Jack Kruschen but towering head and shoulders above everyone is the brilliant Jack Lemon running the gamut from A to BEYOND Z. Coming up to half a century old and STILL better than most of the stuff coming out of Hollywood today. A true classic.",
46,17 December 2018,rachelgallit,8," Though the film is Black and White, the moral implications are anything but...","This film dances curiously on the line between depressing/lack of morality and a classically satirical comedy. The staging and dialogue are razor sharp and precise and keep the action moving and the emotions being conveyed crystal clear and tangible, even if the words being said conflict with the truth. The apparent lack of ethics in protagonist C.C. Baxter's actions, when he lends his apartment to his bosses and eventually his direct superior, Sheldrake, for their romantic rendezvous, make the romantic interest in the elevator operator, Miss Kubelik, seem wholesome by comparison.

He is the tenant of a small apartment which he allows senior executives of the firm to use for sexual assignments with their mistresses.

As a result Baxter quickly finds himself promoted from his lowly position to that of a junior executive with his own office and a key to the executive washroom. Complications arise, however, when Baxter falls in love with Fran Kubelik, the elevator girl who just happens to be the mistress of Jeff Sheldrake, the head of the company's personnel department, who has often taken Fran and his other mistresses back to Baxter's apartment.

That is, until he discovers the firm's big wigs will do him some grand favors IF he lets them use his convenient apartment for their many dalliances. C.C. agrees to the arrangement and is often left on the doorstep, waiting for entry into his own habitat again. Meanwhile, C.C. has a crush on a pretty, perky elevator girl named Fran (Shirley MacLaine). Trouble is, unknown to C.C., Fran has been involved with the head of the company, Jeff (Fred McMurray). Jeff is married, of course, but that did not keep him from having his good times with Fran. The day arrives, naturally, when Jeff wants to meet Fran at C.C.'s place.

66,6 October 2012,bebop63-1,9," Definitely Not A ""Lemon"" Lemmon Movie","A timeless classic in director Billy Wilder's typical anti-establishment satirical style, this is one of Jack Lemmon's best imho. He plays the protagonist CC Baxter, working in a large insurance firm in New York City, just one of many faces in a sea of desks and office machines on a floor of the building. Though he is surrounded by a multitude of people in and out of the office, he is alone socially, having no visible family nor close friends. The main diversion (if it can be called that) he has is lending out his bachelor style apartment to the middle-ranking executives of the insurance firm for their extra-marital trysts, in return they promise him that they will put in a good word with the higher management for him to get promoted to a better position. This he complies with, even if it puts him at such as a disadvantage as having to stand outdoors in freezing weather while waiting for the current occupant to vacate the apartment. In reply to one reviewer who questioned why the philandering men don't just take their lovers to a hotel, there are two possibilities: First, they were too tight-fisted to pay the expense of a room in a hotel - why spend money when they could just use a low-ranking junior employee's joint for free, and the second and more likely reason, is that there's the risk that they would be seen by known associates and acquaintances if they were to conduct trysts in such a public place such as a hotel, and their personal affairs revealed to their detriment. But then I digress. A lot of viewers find no humour nor romance in this movie, even if it is classified as a romantic comedy, and to an extent they are right. The supposedly funny scenes are not the sort that you would want to guffaw at, maybe just a snicker or two, but on the whole it does have its light moments, mostly based on misunderstanding and misinterpretation of situations, like Baxter's doctor neighbor assuming that he (Baxter) is a womanizing playboy causing a lot of ruckus most nights in his apartment when actually it's the doing of others. The fact that he leaves a wastebasket full of empty alcohol bottles (courtesy of the executive's liaisons) outside his door doesn't help improve his standing in the doc's eyes either. If by definition of romance, one would expect hot steamy kissing and bed scenes, then prepare for disappointment, as this movie contains none of that. Baxter does eventually fall for pretty elevator operator Fran Kubelik (played so expertly by Shirley McLaine), but does so in a modulated, hesitant way, and only because circumstances begin to arise such that she ends up in his apartment (after being left behind by her lover Sheldrake), and he's left to pick up the pieces of her failed romance literally, just like he's left to collect the litter left behind in his apartment by his higher up bosses after their dalliances. Fred McMurray is memorable as the sleazy despicable Personnel Director Jeff Sheldrake, a role as far from what we expect from McMurray, who usually plays nice guy in previous movies. He is deliciously detestable in playing on the emotions of Kubelik, making her think that he truly loves her and will divorce his present wife to marry her. The other characters - the middle ranking managers, the office workers, etc serve merely as cogs to fill in the completeness of the wheel to get the story going. All in all this is a very watchable film, and one deserving to rank as one of the classics in film history.",

Thru the years watching this classic it has left an impression on me, positive for the acting, negative for the storyline. Indeed! As I got older I began to see people I have worked with and known to be suitable candidates for parts in this movie. Indeed, again! Although not a comedy, per se, THE APARTMENT could be categorized with television's ALL IN THE FAMILY, where , truthfully, all of us saw glimpses of ourselves and others in Archie Bunker! Fred MacMurray, playing Jack Lemmon's sinister boss, is a standout in the role of the boss we all love to hate, complete with all the arrogance and yes, sir no, sir authority that must be obeyed or else. Also the role was one of a few in which MacMurray played a genuine cad and was pretty darn good at it. Lemmon is memorable in a role we all can identify with as the little guy just trying to get a slice of the pie. Unfortunately, to what lengths one goes through to meet this achievement ultimately determines his or her fate. More over, Wilder cleverly disguises Lemmon as a younger version of MacMurray, only with a conscience, and letting the cards fall where they may. Last, but not least, is the adorable Shirley MacLaine as the innocent caught up in their scheme of schemes and the saving grace for Lemmon. There's a terrific supporting cast of familiar faces in equally memorable roles, notably Ray Walston who is just so much fun to watch as part of the troop movement. See this at least once and compare notes. You have been warned.",

To even call it a comedy-drama would be a stretch as the comedy to drama ratio skews far, far away from the comedic side of things. There are no big laughs here. There are barely even any mild chuckles. Which again is not to say this is a bad movie.

Wilder and Diamond are playful with the repeats (the hands showing ""four"", the mirror, the key, the cookie crumbling, and of course ""mensch"").

I guess it must be how sad everyone is during this movie. Oh sure, there seems to be some sort of resolvement in the end, but aside from that, everyone seems to just go through life's rituals in the most routine way possible. The ironic thing is that for the very few people that are NOT sad sacks, are the ones who are somewhat immoral, and cheating on their wives and what not. Or, when you're drunk, or both. Take a look at the Christmas party at C.C. Baxter's company during Christmas time. Compare it with any other time, where it's deadly serious and quiet. So why is it that the sadder ones have the more worries and the more happy ones seem to fly by without a care in the world? I'm not sure, and I think this is one of the problems leaves up to the viewer, which I think is quite brilliant. Jack Lemmon is, what he always seems to be, and that's brilliant. Shirley Maclaine is quite good here as well, playing with a certain edge I haven't seen her portray before. And Fred Macmurray seems to be having a ball again playing someone with absolutely no scruples whatsoever (aka Double Indemnity).",
78,3 August 2021,nickenchuggets,9," ""Shut up and deal""","I know that this movie is regarded by most people to be amazing, and while there definitely is truth to that, there are some moments and things in it that annoy me. Directed by one of the all time best filmmaking had to offer (Billy Wilder), The Apartment tells the story of Calvin ""Bud"" Baxter who allows people who outrank him at work to use his apartment to carry out adulterous activities. We get familiar with Bud and his workplace very quickly. The office building is located in New York, and it's here that he makes his first move toward getting a promotion. After letting some people at his job ""borrow"" his place of residence for a while, it starts to make people living near Bud think he is cheating on someone. This arises because of the nearly limitless stream of girls that come in and out of his apartment. Little do the neighbors realize, they don't have any affiliation with Bud. Later, Bud's kindness appears to pay off, as his boss Jeff says he will promote him, but only on the stipulation that Bud allows him entry to his apartment. Meanwhile, an elevator worker named Fran Kubelik (Shirley McLaine) is approached by Bud after he is in a good mood because his boss promised to promote him. Before much time passes, Bud makes the sickening discovery that Fran is the same girl his boss is taking to Bud's apartment every day. When he goes home to check on her, he finds her in a horrific state. She apparently tried to kill herself by swallowing drugs. A doctor is called up to save her life, and Bud watches over her in the safety of his apartment. As their relationship grows, so does the amount of trouble Bud is in. Fran's brother-in-law shows up to Bud's apartment and punches him after a visitor rats out Bud's relationship with Fran to his coworkers. After getting yet another promotion from his boss, Bud proclaims how he is too much of an intellectual to work in a place so stupid and leaves. Fran pulls the plug on her affair with Jeff, and she goes to Bud's apartment to play cards. The reason I said there are some annoying moments in this movie is because there's one part that involves Bud having a blocked nose and in my view they overplay it too much. Jack Lemmon also has a kind of snarky, in your face attitude for the whole movie as well, since the plot is basically him believing he deserves a promotion. Shirley plays Miss Kubelik, who is originally shown to be an elevator worker, but then goes on to be both Bud's love interest and Jeff's love interest when Bud has his back turned. In the end, she decides Bud's employer is not worth her time. Like Bud, she is frequently shown to be unlucky. A surprising fact about this movie is that it was the last black and white film to win an Oscar for a very long time (until 1993 when Schindler's List came out). In a way, the record still stands because that movie does have a few color sequences, but not many. Overall, The Apartment is often considered one of the best movies to be released, but given that Billy Wilder was directing, it shouldn't surprise anybody.",

MacLaine has some good moments, but overall, she's as one dimensional as her co-stars, which is a shame, because there were a few times that you felt genuinely sorry for her abuse at the hands of Sheldrake (MacMurray).

In my opinion,this is Billy Wilder's greatest directing achievement ever.Even though it's a comedy,there are a lot of interesting and dramatic moment that push the charm and characters forward and it's quite impressive.",

I was 13 when I first saw it, and I had to be accompanied by my mother, who saw no reason not to let me see this rather cynical film with the unbelievable happy ending. To me, the outstanding performance is given by Fred MacMurray, who plays against type as a narcissistic heel. The movie reeks of pre-sexual revolution psychology, with Shirley MacLaine giving it her all as the weepy, fragile victim and Jack Lemmon delivering a cloying version of her redeemer. Sixty years after this film's release, it seems rather tame, and contemporary audiences may have a difficult time understanding why MacLaine is so enamored with MacMurray in the first place (success is sexy?) and why Lemon plays along. Favorite line, delivered by MacLaine: ""Some people take; some people get took.""",

120,1 April 2014,ALauff,9, How to get ahead,"The work-home boundary endures constant revision in this deceptively tough romance that asks the question, ""To what degree would you allow yourself to be used, manipulated, and mistreated in the fulfillment of a goal?"" In the case of Lemmon's earnest accountant, the threshold is very high. After all, how else to get ahead at a company of thirty-five-thousand employees? It's a simple transaction: executives use his apartment to entertain their mistresses while he's strung along with promises of a big promotion. He permits this arrangement because, like so many ladder-climbers, he clings to the illusion that work will provide the happiness that he lacks in his personal life. Shirley MacLaine's elevator girl desires love and hopes to find it through an office romance with the suave, double-talking Director of Personnel played by Fred MacMurray. What follows is a near-perfectly written joining together of two used people discovering, respectively, self-respect and self-worth through a relationship built on open communication and blunt honesty. Wilder depicts the corporate office as a nexus of numbing sameness, the precise square rows of desks mirrored exactly by the quadrilateral, equally spaced fluorescent lights—exactly the sort of environment that fosters Lemmon's emotional stasis and inability to break from routine. Brilliantly acted, deftly directed, and briskly edited, The Apartment points up the mercenary nature of corporate life, presenting a uniquely unsentimental romance that is honest about the difficulty of connecting with another person in a mechanized age of impersonal transactions. Charles Williams composed the memorable orchestral theme, ""The Jealous Lover.""",

The social ills and seedy underside of office politics wear different disguises these days, but underneath they are still the same. Briefly, Jack Lemmon is an aspiring clerk who lends the 'use' of his apartment to corporate executives in exchange for career advancement. Simulataneously, he has fallen in love with an elevator operator, Shirley MacLaine, who while on the surface appears sweet and innocent is in fact having an affair herself with the biggest exec of them all, Fred MacMurray. They too of course, make use of The Apartment. From there, the plot turnarounds and discoveries are quite simply perfectly written, acted and directed. A great musical score and quirky memorable supporting characters make a good thing better. What particulalry makes this film so timeless is the uncredited main character, New York City, looking very much as it does today. Enjoy, this is the class of its genre.",

I find ""The Apartment"" similarly annoying. This may be the only comedy from the 60s that attempts to wring laughs from an attempted suicide. But if it's a comedy it's not black enough. The suicide is treated like a perfectly typical subplot and a terrific way to poach a girlfriend.

It deals with extra-marital affairs in a comical fashion along with the senior-junior relationship in a typical office setting. The movie gets to its point somewhere towards the end of 1st hour where Lemmon, his boss and a female are unknowingly strangled in a relationship. The movie shows, as to what extent people can go for their ambitions but somewhere down the line they realize that it is the personal life which needs to be happy 1st for professional to be blooming. Also people's incapability to differentiate between true love and infatuation is dealt with nicely in the screenplay.

Jack Lemmon, as usual, is a master of comic delivery, and this is no exception (""...the way it crumbles, cookie-wise."") Shirley MacLaine is superb here, delivering a very real and believable performance as the unlucky-in-love girl, and to think she didn't win an Oscar is a crime. The interactions between her and Lemmon on the screen are the single best elements of this film, in my opinion. With great dialogue like this, there's no doubt in my mind why the film won Oscars for its original screenplay and Best Picture. Nearly everything about the film is believable, and many of us could picture these events happening in our own lives, like it or not. I do not necessarily agree with the underlying theme of adultery and the affairs people are having in this apartment, but I still managed to enjoy many aspects of this film. It's never dull for a minute, and the dialogue and events keep me fascinated the entire time. Little nuggets, such as Lemmon's famous use of a tennis racket to strain spaghetti, make this a classic.

The score is subtle and beautiful, perfectly capturing the feeling of loneliness during the holiday period for people without families to go home to while also nailing the triumphant moments like the ending.

The script is just amazing (so many witty lines and so perfect in construction and small details), and Lemmon and MacLaine make a charming pair. I think this is Lemmon's best screen performance- at once he is both loony and love-struck and light-hearted yet serious. He pulls off the trick of making Baxter look like a completely ordinary guy off the street (working in an office with a zillion other people), yet the most individual person you would ever meet, with his tennis racquet as sieve and humming. MacLaine is wonderful and has an unusual appeal. I love the gamine look (in fact, her hair in this film is almost exactly like mine), and she's so quirky that she makes the ""dumb"" aspects of her character (Please!

Or why an intelligent, attractive, kindly gal like Fran would fall in love with a schlub like C.C. Baxter. (It doesn't help that Lemmon and MacLaine have zero sexual chemistry). Still, we forgive it these lapses because of scenes that are pure, Kennedy 60s magic, like the ones between MacLaine and MacMurray at the Chinese assignation restaurant, complete with enabling piano player, waiter and bartender, and the four corporate, adulterer dwarves who fuel Baxter's rise to the top.

143,30 May 2017,drqshadow-reviews,8, Prodding the Plight of the Pushovers,"Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, an over-accommodating insurance grunt, trying his best to climb the corporate ladder by offering favors to his superiors. In this case, those favors include the use of his bachelor pad for extramarital affairs, and Baxter often finds himself literally shut out in the cold while the bigwigs have their fun. At heart, it's a tale of the meek taking orders from the boastful, allowing themselves to be taken advantage of for fear of a distant, looming consequence. Baxter soaks up this treatment, of course, but so does his longtime crush, the lovely elevator girl Fran (Shirley MacLaine), who's found herself tangled in the complicated web of an office manager. Both reach personal lows, defeated by the world and pestered by constant external irritations, but see something familiar in each other that gradually nurtures a renewed sense of self-assurance. Hopeful without feeling unrealistic, melancholy but not menacing, draining and also uplifting, it smoothly harvests a large crop of emotions before producing a set of forever-altered characters in the closing shot.

Bought the DVD some weeks ago and have now picked it up and watched it again and wished heartily that I never waited! Billy Wilder knew how to make a movie and this stellar cast knew how to act. The story is simple enough but it holds you until the final moment (good point about a 40 yr gap is that you forget the ending!)when you exhale. Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine are beyond any comments I could dare to make - they would be impertinent - and the rest of the cast supports ably, may I say brilliantly. The whole damn lot of them were so convincing. This is one of those movies you want to tell all your friends about.",

They are either cheating or being cheated on, but somehow find themselves facing the more severe emotional consequences in the end. What could ever be done to avoid that next heartbreak? Fran Kubelik is a lowly elevator operator, which makes her fair game for the numerous executives of Insurance and Co. She has fooled herself into thinking that eventually Jeff Sheldrake will leave his wife for her. This belief wavers in strength; Shirley MacLaine can provide wit when it is needed, and she seems aloof enough to not bite again at the line that Sheldrake dangles in front of her every few months. She brushes her newly cut hair, shortened to spite him, and openly acknowledges her awareness of just how cruel he is being by stringing her along. ",

Jack Lemmon, in perhaps his best part, is fantastic as the quiet paper-pusher Baxter who is exploited to the maximum by his cynical employees, while he is left with nothing (career-wise and any other...wise), except for his honest intentions, being the only one in the firm with some sense of dignity and respect for human values. Fred MacMurray, in my opinion, never had a better part as the spineless boss. And Jack Kruschen gets everything out of the doctor next door! A total delight from start to finish, and despite of the comedy theme never neglecting the important one: remember to be decent!

154,11 July 2020,pedrometzker,10, Perfect in everything-wise,"Billy Wilder is a diamond in the rough. The Apartment proves this affirmation. An ever-evolving screenplay that, as one of the principles of Wilder's scripts says, grabs the audience by the throat and never let them go. The concept is amazing: a low paid worker lends his apartment to his superiors so them can ran away from their wives. It could go to a wacky comedy path if the story relayed in this premise. But not in the hands of a legend. With complex characters with clear wishes and necessities, Wilder builds a comedy that turns into a tragedy that turns into an inspirational movie. Now, put in the mix a beautiful black and white cinematography, memorable performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine and a precise direction from Wilder himself. Result: CLASSIC!",

156,8 August 2010,jboothmillard,10, The Apartment,"From Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated director Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, The Seven Year Itch, Some Like It Hot), this was a highly rated classic comedy that I knew very little about, and I was most looking forward. Basically, in New York City, lives insurance statistician C.C. 'Bud'/'Buddy Boy' Baxter (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Jack Lemmon) trying to climb the corporate ladder. There is only one thing he can't control properly in his life, his apartment, it started as lending his key to one person at work for a woman, and then two others, and it has continued hundreds of times. Word spreads about this ""service"" Bud is providing, and like he predicted, boss Jeff D. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) does promote him, on the condition that he lets him borrow the apartment too. Bud swallows his anger at the situation, and he plans to try a date with the female elevator operator, Fran Kubelik (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Shirley MacLaine), but he is devastated when he finds out she is Sheldrake's flame. One night, in the borrowed apartment, Fran realises Sheldrake is wrong for her, he has no plans to divorce his wife any time soon, and when he is gone she attempts suicide on an overdose of sleeping pills. Luckilly, Bud finds her, and neighbour Dr. Dreyfuss (Oscar nominated Jack Kruschen), who has been questioning Bud's ""activities"", helps revive her, and Bud promises to look after her while recovering. The recovery lasts over Christmas, Bud does call Sheldrake who doesn't act on it, and he tries to entertain Fran with games of gin rummy, and seeing her in the bad state makes him think about other people using his apartment. Fran is fully recovered, and leaves, kissing Bud on the cheek which confirms his love for her, but she goes back to Sheldrake, who fires his secretary for sharing truths with Fran. The secretary goes to tell Sheldrake's wife the truth, but Sheldrake enjoys his newfound bachelorhood and keep the fling with Fran going, Bud meanwhile stands up for himself and doesn't allow his boos (or anyone else I'm guessing) to borrow the key to his apartment, and he is prepared to quit his job. It comes to New Year's Eve, Fran is with Sheldrake who tells her about Bud quitting, she realises he is her true love, she catches him at the apartment packing to move out, and she insists they finish their game of gin rummy, in the end, he wants to confirm she loves him like he does her, she just says ""shut up and deal"". Also starring Ray Walston as Joe Dobisch, David Lewis as Al Kirkeby, Joan Shawlee as Sylvia, Edie Adams as Miss Olsen, Hope Holiday as Mrs. Margie MacDougall, Johnny Seven as Karl Matuschka, Naomi Stevens as Mrs. Mildred Dreyfuss and Frances Weintraub Lax as Mrs. Lieberman. Lemmon is always reliable in any film he is in, and MacLaine is a great female co-star for him, while Wilder directs with style, this film features in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it certainly deserves that place being a great comedy drama. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Sound, it won the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy. Jack Lemmon was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 93 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 80 on 100 Years, 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition), it was number 20 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 2 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Outstanding!",
157,21 December 2016,jimbo-53-186511,5," The Apartment is a film that's filled with good intentions, but there is so much here that never really rang true with me",For some strange reason The Apartment seems to be billed as a comedy and although it does have some 'comedic' elements it is not a film that I would categorise as a comedy. Anyone expecting a silly bit of fun (along the lines of Some Like It Hot) is going to be in for a bit of a shock. The misleading way that this film is marketed isn't really the problem with this film though and for me the main problems run much deeper....,
158,12 June 2018,jacobtgill,9, Nostalgia at its finest,"This movie won 4 other Oscars-- including director and writer-- and a handful of nominations like nods to the 2 lead roles in Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine. Lemmon plays Mr. Baxter, a gullible schnook (his coworkers' words, not mine. Well... yeah, my words too) who can't say no to his superiors at the office. They borrow his key to the apartment, and they use it for their scandalous affairs; in return, Mr. Baxter keeps getting high recommendations which result in promotions. It's not exactly the lightest of fares, but a consistent script and an endlessly likable lead keep the comedic tone.
 The light-hearted tone mixed with egregious company behavior is seen in full swing on the elevators. Here, executives are quick to play off contact with the elevator girls that laugh it off; such is not the case with the respectable Mr. Baxter. He treats elevator girl Fran with care and shows genuine interest in her. It is indeed the makings of a rom-com, but the film actually gets quite melancholy. Mr. Baxter's boss Mr. Sheldrake finds out about the key, and it turns out he wants in on the action. Only, unbeknownst to Lemmon at the time, that action is supposed to be with Fran. There's an interaction that takes place halfway through the movie that, to me, shows the style of wit, character interaction, and overall mood of the film. Mr. Baxter is feeling down on his luck since it is New Year's Eve and everyone seems to be having the time of their life (including a coworker who has Baxter's apartment reserved for the night), and even though he is being promoted at a breakneck pace, he does not really have any companion to tell about-- now not even Fran. This leads him to a bar with quite an intoxicated woman whose husband is currently on the other side of the country. She tries striking up a conversation, asking about his family (he has none) and relationships (none). After his deadbeat attitude, she says, ""Night like this, it sorta spooks you, walking into an empty apartment,"" to which Lemmon replies, ""I said I had no family. I didn't say I had an empty apartment."" It's not really laugh-out-loud kind of wit that we think of in today's sense, but it is just that clever twist in writing that tries to uplift a story that has its darker moments.
 This will not be the funniest comedy you see, but there are plenty of reasons to watch it. The story unfolds nicely, and I think the leads bring loads of charm to the screen. But really, the main quality brought about upon a viewing today is the level of nostalgia that comes along. The music is fitting but completely over the top, the dialogue is clever without pushing the envelope, the clothes and cars and elevators and lights all reek of 1960, and heck, it is a black and white film. There is inexplicably some joy of watching people have to twirl their fingers to dial each number to make a phone call, and I had the greatest time seeing the remote control Mr. Baxter had for his tv. 
For those of you that think old films are too slow-paced, unrelatable, too black and white, and simply not interesting, really take a look at this movie. The story is one of the most engaging, the characters are vibrant (and yes, a little old-timey), and you will ultimately leave the movie feeling better than before. I'm not really sure how stiff the competition was, but the Oscars for this film feel well-deserved. You hear about Casablanca and Citizen Kane and To Kill a Mockingbird and whatever else, but despite all the acclaim, you don't really hear about The Apartment. And I think that is a bit of a shame because this film should be right up there in being considered a classic.

162,2 March 2008,bobsgrock,10," A dark, funny, and touching piece of work.","After making the gender-bender comedy Some Like It Hot, Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond gave us a cynical, bittersweet, and ultimately satisfying film that is certainly one of the best comedies ever made. It is a simple story of a corporate suck-up who allows his many bosses to use his apartment for extra-marital affairs in order to get promoted. Indeed he does get promoted, but a certain woman comes into his life and begins to complicate things... Jack Lemmon is wonderful and so lovable as C.C. Baxter, and Shirley MacLaine is absolutely captivating. Fred MacMurray is very good as being very unlikeable, which is quite against type for him. Overall, this is a fantastic film. The directing is superb and the screenplay is filled with wonderful and snappy dialogue as well as marvelous insight on universal human themes: love, jealousy, guilt, and the need to be happy. A lot of questions can be raised here, but The Apartment is not for answering questions as much as it is for bringing the facts to light. It is a dark, funny, and touching piece of work; one of the best Wilder films and one of the best films ever.",

I first saw this movie when I was 12 yrs old, and though the sex was over my head, the human interaction was obvious. In the 45 years since, I love this movie more each time I see it. Now my son who only recently saw the film, for the 1st time feels the same way I did when I first saw it (and he's 30 years old). Fred McMurray followed this by doing a 180 degree turn into ""My Three Sons""; I often wondered if the father in ""Sons"" was carrying on as Sheldrake was in this film.

165,14 June 2007,philadelphiastorygirl,10, Best Kept Secrets: The Apartment,"The film industry has benefited many times when friends have decided to work on a picture together. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise are some examples. But none are greater than Billy Wilder and Jack Lemmon. In The Apartment, Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, a lonely man living and working in New York City. He works at an insurance company called Consolidated Life. His desk is on the nineteenth floor but his superiors have been using him with the promise that they will recommend him for a promotion. A key has been floating around the office and Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) on the twenty-seventh floor calls Baxter into his office to question him about it. Mr. Sheldrake tells Baxter that it has come to his attention that there are four rotten apples in the company. It soon becomes obvious that Mr. Sheldrake also wishes to use the apartment. Once Baxter allowed one colleague to use his apartment to change into his tuxedo on the way to a function, he has not been able to refuse it to anyone. But one night changes his outlook. Jack Lemmon is amazing with his subtle humor and genuine kindness. He expertly portrays the sweet but disappointed C.C. Baxter. Fred MacMurray is sleazy and despicable as the careless adulterer. The role of Fran Kubelik was perfectly cast with Shirley MacLaine. She is excellent as the broken hearted woman trying to pick up the pieces of her life. The Apartment was written and directed by Billy Wilder. His screenplay is filled with witty comments but also sincere brutal honesty about the issues people deal with. The main character is forced to choose what he believes in: working his way to the top in any way he can or being a good, honest person. The cinematography in this film is very beautiful. Wilder used interesting shots of New York City for the setting of his tale. It is easy to understand why this film won the best picture academy award.",

168,2 April 2002,Neal Wruck,10," ""Be a mensch!""","On March 27, 2002, as the world has sadly learned, filmmaker Billy Wilder passed away. No doubt, over the passing days, weeks, months and years, there will be some discussion about him and of his work. There will also be biographies, documentaries and other tributes to him. I believe, however, that he should be left to rest in peace and that the only true monument to him is in the great movies he left to us. One of these is 1960's `The Apartment'. Some might disagree with this film's Best Picture win (Considering that it was the same year as `Psycho', `Elmer Gantry' and `Spartacus'), but it's a great movie nonetheless.  ",
169,9 March 2008,st-shot,6, Low Rent,Billy Wilder's comedy The Apartment is every bit as acerbic as his noir work with the exception that no one (there is a failed suicide) dies. Hypocrisy and deception (self and otherwise) are lynch pins to nearly all of his scenarios and with the Apartment he adds these elements in different amounts for his desired effect.,
170,16 February 2000,TheHG,10, Simply Excellent.,"What a delightful movie! It has all the right ingredients for a modern-day tale of an insurance clerk's big-city life. His big career ambitions are earning him an undeserved reputation of a rake by his neighbors. But in reality, he is really a very decent fellow whose only flaw is an unrestrained romantic heart. Jack Lemmon plays J.J. Baxter (a.k.a. ""buddy boy')just perfectly. Shirley MacLaine is the love interest, and Fred MacMurray is surprisingly good in one of those rare roles for him. There is bittersweet romance, and there is plenty of humor and satire. The social setting may seem outdated now, especially in the area of men's predatory attitudes towards women in the work place. But maybe it is only a matter of degree of sophistication. At any rate, like the doctor in this movie says, ""Be a human being!""... and see The Apartment. I guarantee you will be well rewarded!",

175,24 February 2022,NewtonFigg,8, Coincidence? Both times Fred MacMurray played a villain he worked for an insurance company,"I'm not surprised. A few years after the setting of The Apartment, I worked as a Management Trainee in the home office of a major insurance company. The movie does not exaggerate the conditions I experienced during my relatively brief term of employment there. The work day began with a bell ringing. As in the movie, all the faces I saw were white males. The President of the company said that, as long as he was President, he would never hire a black male. Women were secretaries or clerks and could rise only as high as being supervisor of a secretarial or clerical unit. The starting job for a girl with no special skills was mail girl. There were automatic elevators, so no elevator operators. The company preferred to hire graduates of Catholic girls' high schools as they were disciplined and not apt to cause trouble. The boss of my unit, a man in his 50s, had a calendar on his desk. On every page of the calendar he had written the number of days he had to go before he could retire. First thing every morning he sat at his desk, ripped off the previous day's page and announced the current number. The man who sat next to me sometimes seemed lost in space. He said his father had worked as a coal miner to earn enough so his son could go to college, The son wondered aloud if he would have been better off if he had become a coal miner. The man who sat behind me had never forgotten that the company sent him out if town one Christmas week and refused to reimburse him for the long distance call he made to his family on Christmas Day. Every position had a numerical rank. Someone promoted to manager got a glassed in office on the perimeter of the floor and furniture appropriate to his rank. If a new manager moved in to an office previously occupied by a manager of a higher rank, the new man had to wait until the maintenance staff removed the desk and chair in the office and replace them with slightly smaller desk and chair suitable for the new man's grade.",

179,1 September 2005,PWNYCNY,9, What a man will do for sex.,"This is a great movie. This movie shows what a nobody, just another anonymous worker in a huge corporation, has to do to get ahead and shows that belief in hard work as the path to success is just a bunch of baloney. It's who you know and how well you pedal favors that get you promoted. If you behave like a doormat, then someday you may get your own office - as long as you continue sucking up to those who dole out the goodies. This movie also shows how hypocritical people can be and how the people who seem most innocent are the ones who are actually the most perverted and corrupted. For instance, in this movie, the elevator operator girl seems so nice and wholesome, yet she is in fact the biggest and most conniving whore in the company. And what about all the executives? How did they get their jobs? What kind of favors did they have to do to get in good with the boss? And how did the boss get HIS job? Who did he blackmail or suck up to to get the big office with the sexy secretary and the big salary? For the message of this movie is clear - it's not talent or hard work or even luck that gets you ahead, it's how much of a pushover you're willing to become to get an extra crumb from those in power. And this movie also shows what happens when you tire of playing the game. Simply, you're ruined. When Jack Lemmon's character ""C.C."" decides that he doesn't want to play along anymore, he loses his job, has to move, and gets the elevator operator, who by now has been banged so often by the boss and by probably every other Tom, Dick and Harry in the company that only a fool like C.C. would actually want to have anything seriously to do with her. This is a weak ending to an otherwise interesting story. Then again, maybe not - maybe this is the way the movie should end, with a putz like C.C. making a fool of himself again. Gee ... what a guy willing to put up with to get some ""you-know-what.""",

I have no complaints from the first to the last scene, each scene is in its place and has its purpose. It's incredible to me how much was able to fit into one film, how many things happened, it's commendable. Director Wilder is a master of his craft. The story is great, how a lot can happen and connect. A love comedy that is actually more than that, it shows us the complexity of human nature and relationships. The film works equally well as drama and comedy, which is really something unusual and worthy of praise. I only saw the awards he won after watching the film (Oscars for film, screenplay and director) and I'm glad that's the case because it's fully deserved. As far as I'm concerned, this is the perfect movie with a timeless theme and it's aged very well (aside from the obvious things like phones and stuff of course, but that's negligible). Jack Lemmon has achieved one of the best roles in his long career, he is equally silly and funny, but also serious and dramatic.

Does The Apartment have a happy ending ? Arguably, the little lift girl is obliged to settle for the office wimp, since she can't seem to hook the powerful big boss she mistakenly thinks she fancies. It's a sad story, after all. Well performed by Lemmon and MacLaine, while MacMurray seems to be recycling his somewhat similar insurance salesman role that he first delivered in Double Indemnity.

I threw a couple pairs of shoes at the TV screen when he went to Baxter and made the comment about taking a girl out for laughs and right away thinking you're going to marry her.

Ray's one of my favorite actors, not simply because of things like ""My Favorite Martian"", but because of his devilishly delightful role as Satan in ""Damn Yankees"" (my favorite all-time film).  Ray always brings something special to his roles.  And now onto Shirley MacLaine... one of the finest actresses this world has ever seen.  She does such a wonderful job playing Fran Kubelik.  You just want to cry right along with her whenever Sheldrake's being such a pain... and then when she's running to C.C.'s apartment... the look on her face is priceless!!!!

Some good black comedy follows before an eventual happy ending. A few things grate: the continual string music throughout the film, but in many ways, it feels not only funny but still relevent to today's lives: Jack Lemon's character is not a million miles away from Edward Norton's in 'Fight Club', and the film's take on sexual harrassment is also surprisingly in line with modern attitudes.

As you would expect with something written for the screen by Wilder and his associate I.A.L.Diamond, the story moves through a perfect arc of comic situation, misunderstandings, misdirected desires, thwarted hopes, and on to a believable resolution that draws these elements along with it but trumps them all. The dialogue is witty, and the comedy is as broad as the satire is cutting -- one never dominates or displaces the other; we laugh and we sigh at once. There are one or two lacunae in the action -- coffee that should scald; old cooked spaghetti that should no longer be limp -- but to focus on these, and ignore the much that is real and effective, would be a terrible mistake. The scenes of Miss Kubelik and Mr Baxter alone together are quite wonderful.

He must have seen in Fred MacMurray's earlier light romantic comedy portrayals the sinister potential demonstrated first in Double Indemnity and (in a somewhat less corrupt vein) in The Apartment. Similarly, William Holden's traditional ""boy-next-door""  charm was manipulated and put to new use in Sunset Boulevard and Stalag 17. Only viewers who recall the earlier, and mostly forgotten, films of these two actors from the 1930s and 1940s can fully appreciate either Wilder's acumen in looking below the surface or his skill as a director, or both.

With its beautiful black-and-white cinematography, assured direction and strong performances, 'The Apartment (1960)' provides plenty of laughs and feels relatively realistic while it does it. Though there are 'screwball' elements, most of the humour comes from the characters and the unlikely scenario that our protagonist finds himself in.

But then a man even higher on the company ladder wants in and Baxter's carefully orchestrated life starts to crumble underneath him.",
214,13 March 2018,A-G-Deac,10, An important work of cinematography and a great study of character.,"Billy Wilder proved himself to be one of Hollywood's titans, winning 6 Academy Awards during his lifetime with films like ""Sunset Boulevard"" or ""Some Like It Hot"" which have become classics of the American cinema. Out of his 27 credits as a director ""The Apartment"" seems to be his most lasting film, and it is also a personal favorite of mine.
Jack Lemmon plays the part of an employee (C.C Baxter) of a big corporation in New York. His superiors, who call him ""Buddy-Boy"", praise his performances at the place of work. He is intelligent and creative, and he also spends extra-hours at work. This is the result of his apartment becoming the nest were his superiors hide their mistresses, a fact unknown by Baxter's neighbour's who think he's a real ladies' man and are bothered by the noises coming from his apartment.
Shirley MacLaine plays an elevator operator, Fran Kubelik, who's love life is just as empty as Baxter's. She's just one of the victims who fell into the pit of summer-affairs just to find out love's not as easy as it seems. Baxter on the other hand never had the guts to refuse someone, especially a superior. He catches a cold after one of the ""visitors"" gives him back the wrong key and he has to spend the night out in the rain, but the thought of a promotion never lets him say a bad word to his superiors. When the promotion arrives, so does the courage to invite a certain Kubelik to dinner. I will not develop the story further, because I'd steal away the magic of the film. But the real magic is how realistic the whole story actually seems, not the story itself.
The widescreen format allows us to feel the power of the empty spaces which surround the characters, or the emptiness they feel when they're surrounded by other people. The black-&-white image is beautifully made, and it's probably one of Billy Wilder's most visually stunning films. Even with that, Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine are the main reason why you should watch this film. Two actors who wer at the most important point of their carreer, and they made the best out of it. It's amazing how real their characters feel, how much emotion they transmit.
The film speaks about how we fall for our bosses, about how we comfort ourselves with the thought of succes and we accept misery in order to be recognized by our society. We are victims, but we want to be the victims and nobody forces us to be one. The film is also about how we want to be loved, but we're afraid to fight for love. We get used to loneliness and we use it as fuel for our everyday actions. We use for promotions, to avoid scandal or to keep us in our comfort zone.
""The Apartment"" is not a period-piece, it is actual and it's still as powerful as it was in 1960. This film is a must-watch and it's probably Billy Wilder's best work.",

224,26 October 2018,mollrat101,10, An Edward Hopper painting come to life,"The Apartment makes me think of a classic Edward Hopper painting, Automat, and it's easy to picture Fran as the girl in that painting. Feeling isolated and in desperate need of a friend she can share her troubles with.
And that's the focus of this classic movie: loneliness. Many shots establish this feeling of isolation. The rows and rows of desks in the office, so many faces that you can't remember. Just like Baxter, you feel lost in the shuffle. As though you could disappear and the only response would be to put somebody else in your place and move on.
Billy Wilder argues that the only true cure for loneliness is friendship. True, deep friendship that walks with us when we are at our lowest. So many characters in the film are only concerned about what they can take from others. The first example being the men who take over Baxter's apartment. Sheldrake being the most egregious of the bunch. The only person in the film who consistently gives is Baxter. And that is why he develops the most genuine relationship in the movie, with Fran. True connection can only exist when we share our sadness and accept each other at our worst. Love is about giving.
Fran and Baxter may or may not end up in a romantic relationship together, but that's not the point of this movie. The point is that they both found true connection.
It's a classic film about loneliness in the city by one of the greatest screenwriters of all time, Billy Wilder. I can't recommend it highly enough.",

My ninth film from Wilder is among his very best, a sophisticated, sensitive and cynical comedy/drama/romance that satirises and critiques corporate big business and America's fading moral standards. Jack Lemmon, following the success of the director's previous film the hilarious cross-dressing farce 'Some Like It Hot (1959)'  here proves his worth as a dramatic actor, bringing to the character of C. C. Baxter the charm and sincerity of an average, working-class American employee, trying to making an honest living from his powerless position as an office clerk at a large, impersonal insurance firm. In a society where power leads to corruption, Baxter finds his own steadfast morals beginning to slide, having agreed to loan out his apartment to higher-ranked business executives for the purposes of their underhanded extra-martial affairs. It is an act through which Baxter hopes to climb the corporate ladder, though he is simultaneously disgusted by the moral implications of his actions; lending out his apartment is the business equivalent of prostitution, and he recognises that he is merely being exploited in a manner than harms his moral integrity.",

As Shirley MacClaine notes in her heartbreaking role as Fran Kubilek, ""Some people take, some people get took. And they know they're getting took and there's nothing they can do about it"". The Apartment is perhaps the first time Wilder gives us a protagonist who belongs in this second group. C. C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is a man whose will to succeed in the workplace casts a dark shadow upon his private life. But rather than manipulate the system in order to meet his own ends in the manner of the central figures from Wilder's Stalag 17, Double Indemnity and Ace in the Hole, Baxter allows himself to be manipulated in the hope that it will eventually lead to happiness. However, given the vein of cynicism which runs through even Wilder's most optimistic films it is clear from the offset that such a way of living will not end well.",

Baxter finds out, that his boss takes the very same girl in his apartment, he himself is secretly in love with. Just perfect. Jack Lemmon gives his best performance ever, among a long career of excellent acting, and so does Shirley Mc.Lane. Each role, even the smallest is perfectly casted. Just think about the girl, that tries to impersonate Marilyn Monroe or the landlady, or doctor Dreyfuss and his wife... But you should watch it the original version, because otherwise you miss a lot of the best points. If necessary try the subtitles. I recently showed it to the teenage children of a friend. Although they belong to the MTV Generation, they loved it. That finally convinced me, that quality movies are timeless.",

It has an interesting storyline. The acting is great. The music, scenes, and all else is well worth it.
With the exception of the good doctor, there isn't a character who isn't a degenerate. Sign of the times I guess. Then, people knew there was no such thing as hard work. Thank goodness for the 60's and onwards, or we'd still be in a backward place.

Second, it is well cast - the players are suited to the parts and bring them off very well.  Though I do cringe a little at Jack Lemon in his many roles, like this one, in which he ""gets took"".  Third, it is a wonderful expose of commercial office life in the 1950s.  Those massive floors full of clerical workers have disappeared today, replaced by computers, and gone with them is the hierarchical office culture of the period.  My only reservation is that the male figures in senior management are completely nasty - straw men against whom to contrast the Lemmon character.

Meanwhile, Bud's one romantic crush, Consolidated elevator girl Fran Kubelik (MacLaine), turns out to be Sheldrake's FIFTH office romance partner among the 31,259 employees laboring within the CLI Manhattan skyscraper. THE APARTMENT is 125 minutes long (mathematically, that's 5 to the third power), and Fran has the movie's last line (after running out on the now involuntarily-separated Jeff's belated sort-of marriage proposal, to Bud's nearby digs during the early minutes of Jan. 1, 1960): ""Shut up, and deal.""

Many of the scenes of Baxter's interactions with other characters are unwatchably painful. Or painfully unwatchable. Maybe both.

In The Apartment he tries to mix the two but he never truly lands the dismount as it were and the character of Baxter has every drop of comedy stolen from him as we watch him be abused by everyone around him including his love interest. The piece would have been a great character study, but it is never allowed to be. The acting is on point, Lemmon does what he can with a character that is penned in by a script that does not know how to portray him. He breathes life into a man so morally drained and emotionally inept that one would loathe him if there were not that ray of sunshine peaking through. The script bleeds Hollywood which is fine as this is a romantic movie and they tend to not need a heady dose of gritty reality. Ultimately it is a lighthearted romantic movie with the sexism of Madmen thrown in. So if you wish to know where the mould for modern romance was created look no further.",
259,5 November 2003,toolkien,10, A great movie with some flaws (spoilers),"This is one of my favorite movies mostly because I relate to the Lemmon character (had a very similar experience and the cad's name was Geoff too!). To my tastes everything about the movie was well above average; script, acting, and directing. The only major flaw in my overall enjoyment is the over-extended pathos in the last third of the movie (the post suicide attempt apartment scenes). When Kubilek weakly sags into the living room chair, one more ode to despair, I very nearly give up caring about the character (those elven good looks keep me involved). But that is about it (the only other flaw may be the indictment of corporate culture, but I view it broader terms of the unfortunate side effect of any group culture, so it washes off).",

There is not a superfluous line and no emotion is milked. Lemmon, who has made some bad films but never given a bad performance, is sublime as the flawed Everyman on the make. The viewer actually feels 'There but for the grace of God... The actors' timings are impeccable and Wilder gives every scene what it is worth and no more. Nowadays a director would err towards bathos. Key to its success as an unforgettable movie is that no one looks as if they are working too damn hard  it's so bloody subtle, something few modern directors would see unless a ton of subtlety fell on their heads!

Jack Lemmon's excellent portrayal makes this protagonist seem like a genuinely upbeat man but also sadly naive and lacking in respect. When he rents out his apartment to his executives in exchange for promotions, what he's really missing is that he's really lending part of himself and the rules of the game are not on his terms. This is a great example of when to set healthy boundaries! The other main character, Ms. Kubelik, is also rather naive in her own endearing (yet disturbing) way. The imperfections of the characters make them seem very realistically human and make the scenarios feel believable and relatable, especially when their boss exploits their desires and insecurities.

He took the initiative to work overtime, which seemed to be hardworking and hard work, but in fact it was because he could not return home, because he was lonely, he lent his apartment to colleagues who cheated with his lover, and the advantage he received was that his colleagues would replace him in front of the leader. He said good things and helped him get promoted and raise his salary to the top of his life. The film spends a lot of time showing that he is lonely and downstairs in his apartment waiting for his colleagues to end the fight, then hides in the dark watching his colleagues and lovers leave, and finally returns to his apartment alone. Sometimes he even received a temporary phone call from a colleague while he was sleeping, asking him to vacate the apartment. He was entangled in a difficult situation. When he heard that his colleague said that he would help him promote, he still resolutely agreed ...

However, she eventually openly admits to her flaws on camera and soon realizes her worth through the kind and very loving words of Bud. Fran was a character I feel is all too familiar with many women; those who are promised a life of happiness and love through grand gestures and sweet talk, but it all turns sour. As for Bud, I just love him. He's had such a traumatic life before meeting Fran and was always being taken advantage of or being made fun of for his past actions. I found his character rather relatable, in the sense that Bud took the things that should have, and nearly did, kill him and turned them into something extraordinary.

The Apartment is a good deal less fun and much darker than Some Like it Hot, but it is still a sweet film with a few good laughs. Jack Lemmon plays an officious office worker who regularly allows his higher-ups and their mistresses to use his apartment as their love nest. He has two people he is desperate to impress – a friendly elevator girl, played by Shirley MacLaine, and his suave, unscrupulously boss, played by Fred MacMurray. What starts out as a cute film takes a dark turn, with some moments involving suicide that made me genuinely uncomfortable. Shop Around the Corner came to mind as I watched it, only instead of a handful of kind characters, we're left with Jack Lemmon as the one decent person in the film. Any pleasure derived from this film will largely depend on the viewers' opinion of him. I found him appealing, but I could also understand someone finding his jittery style too annoying to tolerate. This is a well-written romantic comedy that is at once sweet and cynical in tone, one that does not skip over the darker human emotions and tendencies. As I watched it I found myself unable to keep from smiling at some points and ready to cry at others. It isn't a romance between two gorgeous people who in the real world could have anyone they wanted. The romantic leads are two cheerful nobodies who are used to struggling while watching others succeed. Their vulnerability makes for a less fun romantic comedy, but a touching one nonetheless.",

I have seen this film numerous times but not in the last ten years but for me, my view will not have changed and it will not seem dated. I know this because this is a classic and its beauty is in its simplicity. This does not mean that it was rushed or thrown together but exactly the opposite. You can see and feel the care and attention to detail that went into its creation. The result is more than a total of its constituent parts which for me is a sign of a very good film and it really has a magical quality. So many so called comedies whenever they were made just don't measure up in comparison but that is good because if comedies were all bad or all excellent this would not stand out as it rightly does. All of the numerous people who were responsible for this beautiful creation should be justly proud because fifty years after it was made it will still be delighting new viewers. The story is quite rightly based around the title but really it is a character study of virtually all of the main characters who include the good and the bad and a lot of people in between. I could not envisage the film being improved whether it was at the time or 2010 when this review was written.

Then Shirley MacLaine enters the film as Miss Kubelik the gorgeous lift attendant who Baxter falls for and everything turns upside down. There's great comedy at play here but also some serious drama and a huge amount of soul. The film deservedly won a number of Oscars, including best picture, Director and best screenplay and Shirley MacLaine can consider herself very unfortunate to have missed out for her magnificent performance. Jack Kruschen is also fabulous as Dr Dreyfuss and he narrowly missed out at the Oscars as best supporting actor to Peter Ustinov's unbeatable performance in Spartacus.

But this film, if only his father could have seen it, would have known that his son got the right career choice. The movie also has Shirley MacLaine, another actor with quite a few high quality credits to her liking.

The script, the performances, the atmosphere, the maturity of the scenario etc. But, and here's the thing, I really didn't 'enjoy' it this time. So much of the culture that was reflected in this movie is so obviously appalling, that As a man I felt like a voyeur, a participant in the degradation of the young women. When it was made it took a moral view, it showed us a reality that was distasteful. But at this distance and with #MeToo having enlightened us perhaps even more, even Lemmons character must be seen as a big part of the problem. Th whole situation is so sordid, not because of the 'bad guy' but because it points to the much broader and bigger problem of how men treat women routinely in this culture.

341,28 April 2012,jacabiya,10, A masterpiece,"What more can you say about one of the best films, best scripts and best male lead performances ever? The great Billy Wilder co-writes (along with I.A.L. Diamond, whose contribution should not be forgotten) and directs with precision, without a false note, in a style he perfected, this gem of a satire on the corporate world, sex and human values. Lemmon is simply amazing, ideally cast for the role, with one of the greatest physical comedy performances of all time. The change from satirical comedy - which is hilarious, comedywise - to drama is still striking. This, along with its pervasive view on sex, makes this 50's looking film more of a 60's film and a prime example of the changing of the times. There are as many funny one-liners and sight gags as you will find in any comedy (""We don't want this to leak out"", ""How many times? Three"", ""How's your knee?"" ""Stay with it, buddy boy""), and the photography - which amazingly captures in widescreen the claustrophobic feeling of the apartment - and music are memorable. The supporting cast is sensational with all actors delivering fantastic performances. But this is Wilder's film all the way. This is not only in the IMDb 250 list (currently ranked 94) and highly ranked by the AFI: it was ranked 14 by directors in the prestigious Sight & Sound 2002 survey of the top films of all-time (right there among such masterpieces as 2001, La dolce vita and Tokyo Story!) attesting to how high Wilder's peers think of his work in this film.

It's pacing is slow but deliberate, the story it tells is cohesive and never confusing. The dialog is witty yet relatable, and it's cinematography is nothing short of pure eye candy being a rare black and white film shot very wide with long lenses and long takes used.

In Baxter, we are to believe there exists a man who obsequiously offers his bed and his tiny one-bedroom apartment to other men; to achieve their sexual gratification; those mere scavengers' who roam the ""office jungle"" where Baxter works. We are asked in ""The Apartment"" to accept Baxter, not as a junior executive or a back-office drone, but as the proverbial ""deer-in-the-headlights"" as ""Bambi"" road kill that he is; the food that scavengers survive upon.",
