0,21 October 2000,zetes,10, Absolutely Perfect. One of the best films ever made. 10/10,"It is a little known fact that India produces more films per year than any other country. The reason that most people don't know that is because their films do not generally appeal to us, and we would see them as oddities suspended in their own culture. Possibly they'd be amusing or interesting to watch, but they would probably be hard to enjoy (to demonstrate the difference in taste, Roger Ebert attended an Indian film festival a year or two ago, and when he questioned its director what American film did the best business over there, he answered that the movie _Baby's Day Out_, which is basically like one of those Popeye cartoons where Sweet-Pea wanders through construction sights blindly, except extended to 90 minutes, had theaters packed in India all throughout its run; the film bombed completely in the US). Tastes differ. Humanity does not. This is proved to the utmost in Ray's masterful _Pather Panchali_. ",/
1,1 March 1999,harry-76,10, An Indian Classic,"Ray's ""Pather Panchali,"" the first of his unforgettable ""Apu Trilogy,"" is a remarkable film experience. The acting is strong, the direction and script, sure, and the total work, eloquent and moving. A film which one can return to again and again, and each time one can discover new elements.  This is a staple of my video library, along with Ray's other two films which complete the trio, ""Aparajito"" and ""The World of Apu."" I have watched the trilogy in a continuous sitting on two occasions, and the experience was emotionally overwhelming.",r

4,2 August 2006,Camoo,10, one of the most profound films ever made,"I won't go into detail about this film, because the greatest films ask that you really just sit back and enjoy them without questioning. This is in a very very small handful of films that create a kind of 'ecstatic truth' that Werner Herzog is always talking about. There is not a moment of hand-fed emotion, and that's probably what hits you first after the film is finished. This is probably why the film has not hit even the first 250 on the IMDb list, while it is more easily accessible than, say, most 'foreign' pictures, it still refuses at every turn to make a clich√© out of itself or to be unfair to the audience or its characters by making its machinations obvious, a ploy that most filmgoers fall for time and time again. A reason for this might be that Ray, a young director at the time who had already worked with Jean Renoir on his landmark film about India called 'the River', really didn't have a lot of money or power to wield around, and made this tight, intimate story on a shoestring with an amateur crew, without real concern for anything else but this story that he wanted to tell. A lot of that comes across - the locations, the actors - were all real, however this is a work of masterful collaboration between director, cinematographer, actors, sound recordist, and particularly the editors, a collaboration that is unparalleled in most modern, big budget films. This is a movie created solely with passion, and I am joining in the crusade to make this one of the top 250 on IMDb, though it should, by default, belong on the top 10 of anybody's list.",i
5,30 January 2004,ballweg,10, As good as remembered...,"I originally saw the Apu trilogy in 1961 in a little theater in Berkley. Sat through a straight showing of all three films and walked out after six hours in awe. It was a defining day in the development of an avid film buff. I have waited three years for the DVDs to be released, and hoped against hope that Criterion would get the rights, but it was not to be. Sony has released an unadorned, Mirchant and Ivory Foundation restoration: but they are finally available. I bought all three of the Trilogy the day they were released, but have been reluctant to put them on. So many of my memories of ""great"" films have made me wonder what I was on when I saw it to think that was great. Think ""Brewster McCloud."" My experience of Pather Panchali and the full trilogy was a memory I didn't want diminished in any way. Tonight I came home from work, put the Pather Panchali in and sat totally rapt for the full two hours. The DVD production values and the print quality are really bad in spots, but all that fades as one of the really great art films takes over, and the immersion in the lives behind the film works its magic. Film doesn't have to be an act of corporate commerce: Pather Panchali is living proof that film can be a medium of great art.",e
6,18 July 2005,infoseeker531,9, What a story!,"I have just finished Pather Panchali. To be honest, it took almost two weeks to watch it. Not only interruptions, but the shear poverty of the individuals--the family--is overwhelming. Each member exhibits their poverty and destitution in a different way. My favorite character is Durga, who gives and gives until she reaches the point where she is tired of not receiving.",w

8,25 March 2009,artzau,10, Incredible,"As an anthropologist who is a film buff, I'm always fascinated by films with solid ethnographic content. Ironically, I must confess that I had never seen Pather Panchali completely. The several times I started to watch the film, seemingly something arose during those few times and I never got very far into it. However, now in my senescent years, I finally got around to seeing it after realizing that I never had taken the time to see it. Having read about the trilogy and about Satyajit Ray, I look back and wonder why of all the classics I've seen, I'd overlooked these works of Ray. Maybe it was the trauma I experienced 50 years ago at UC Berkeley while taking a year of Sanskrit but I doubt it. I'll only say now I must have been saving it for a treat during my later years. And, what a treat! The film has a languid quality and moves slowly, listfully. The imagery is diffused due to in part the quality of the film but the eye of the camera misses nothing from shots of nature to a kitten stumbling and licking itself, to the old Auntie brushing away flies from her food. The starkness of their poverty does not affect the world of a little boy as it does his frustrated mother and sister. His father, a kind-hearted dreamer, seems resigned to his lot and is willing to take less to keep his sense of life and desire in balance. All of this life trajectory is classic Indian and Ray shows us to us through the camera's eye in a way that is moving, joyous and profound. This is their world and Ray lets us see it through their eyes. Akira Kurasawa called Ray a genius and we guess we could say, it took one to know one.",r
9,9 September 2005,sumanta6,10, One of the best,The film is certainly a masterpiece. The film is overwhelmingly real and the key element in the movie is the maintenance of this realism. The characters are so true to the ethnic rural-sixties Indian existence that one is compelled to wonder if the film was captured through surveillance cameras. ,w
10,4 May 2005,prince_corum,10, A Magnificent Movie!,"I don't know how even 6.4% of the female voters could have given this movie a 2!!!!! This was Ray's first movie, but his economy of dialog, his synchronization and sympathy with India's rural life is incredible. So little said, yet so much! Apu and Durga following the sweetmeat seller, the scene where they run through a ""kash"" field....superb, the work of a real artist, a master. The film develops its characters and the atmosphere slowly and resolutely. The narrative builds up to a powerful climax. Ray had an ancient camera while shooting this movie, did it matter? No. His expression and technique was more than sound, although this was a maiden venture. ",5
11,18 February 2007,magnuspy,10, Powerful stuff.,"This astoundingly powerful movie depicts the life of a poor ""Brahmin"" family in a rural Indian village. The movie conveys the power of hope that can sustain ordinary people beset by the most hopeless of circumstances. The acting was sublime. I wonder where they found the woman who played the old auntie. Rake-thin and bent over, she could convey entire worlds of meaning with her sunken eyes. I don't want to even try to explain the movie, conveying the essence of this one is beyond my abilities. I could not get this movie out of my mind for weeks. I am not the sort of person who even remotely feels like crying during movies, but this one had me weeping like a child.",6
12,24 June 2022,briancham1994,4, Am I missing something?,"I usually don't like realistic slice-of-life dramas, but even giving the film as much credit as I possibly can, I still don't see why it is regarded as a masterpiece. There are a few things I can commend it for, especially the acting. I can totally believe in the eccentric grandmother, the strung-out mother, the mischievous sibling relationship and the simple but fragile village life. Yet I also feel like nothing really happened. After about the first fifteen minutes, I got the main message of what life is like for these characters, and then the film offered nothing else beyond that. I was totally more interested in the dogs than Tunu's necklace.",6
13,20 February 2013,ironhorse_iv,8, This movie is a milestone in Indian cinema,"Watching the film, Pather Panchali (Song of the Little Road) directed by Satyajit Ray, you would have thought that Ray was a season veteran director, but in truth, it's his debut work about the life of a family in Bengal living in poverty. Based on the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, when Ray started this film, I think Ray had literally never held a movie camera. I understand that Italian neo-realist films had a big influence on him; all to the better. There are a number of key scenes shot in the film that beholds the beauty and emotional depth in itself. The film never had a complete script; it was made from Ray's drawings and notes. Ray tried to extract and build a simple theme out of the apparently random sequences of significants. Some notable shifts from the novel in the script include the death scenes of key characters, one which occurs quite early in the novel in a village shrine at the presence of some adult members of the family; in the film that key character dies in the open in the presence of the family children, Apu and Durga. The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of the train is not there in the novel, neither child manages to see the train there, although they made an attempt. That scene alone is well played. Such a beautiful scene. I love the sounds of the wind and the hum of the electricity, and the slow, fading edits. It captures perfectly the landscape and the young child's curiosity. The train shows the changes happening in India, and we know the children will grow into a world that is different to their parents. They are left gazing at a thin veil of smoke as the sound of the wind returns. It is very moving. Camera work as usual in Satyajit Ray's film is always brilliant as it has used lot of drifting tracking shot. There almost cosmic emotional power in some other scenes, such as the sunset with Apu and that of the monsoon. The scene from when the snake creeps into an abandoned 'house of sorrows' to their stunned faces on the ox cart was a unforgettable Ravi Shankar theme. I think it foreshadows death. Apu & sister Durga share an intimate bond, they exploring their little world and sharing secrets are the most remarkable aspect of this film. The language might be foreign to me but the emotions were completely native. The film took three years to complete the shooting, and it's was just lucky it got finished with little to no money to product. Pather Panchali was followed by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life 'Aparajito' (The Unvanquished) in 1956 & Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. The only faults I can find in this film is that it's insanely depressing. The movie has a lot of death, and nothing really get any better for the family as the film goes on. There is no happy ever after, as this isn't Slumdog Millionaire. The movie is hard to find, and if found, it's rarely in English subtitles and the video transfer is horrible, the sound transfer only marginally better. Another factor is the disconnection by scene to scene, and gives an all-inclusive quality to the film; yet it is also distracting and contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention as the film pace is slow. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through. It's run time is 122 mins, and there are long periods of time of nothing going on. One can stare in dull amaze for only so long looking at nature. The first half is nearer to social realism, setting out the social hierarchies, introducing characters and their social or family role, defining them against other people, their home and nature. The second half of the film, however, becomes more abstract, even mystical. There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action. Film is still better than 2 most of today's loud, flashy torture bollywood movies. This film is true art.",8
14,24 December 2007,nirajkmr,10, At last I happen to see this masterpiece,Growing up in India I had heard of this movie as one of Satyajit Ray's classics and a movie which showed the utter poverty of rural India. Anything classic used to evoke a feeling of a movie usually boring and worse it's most likely would be a black and white film lamenting on the sorry state of human affairs. Of course those were the childhood metrics to gauge what a good film should be and thankfully I have outgrown those notions. ,5
15,2 August 2002,tc707,10, document of unbridled realism,"Ray's Pather Panchali is a document of unbridled realism which explores the life of a Bengali family in their struggles with the harsh conditions of early 20 th century India. Existing in an infinate desert of mainstream 'in your face' hollywood cinema, I found this film a wonderful oasis. I do admit that this film moves very slow and I did initially struggle with this. However, its slow pace allows one to ""slow down"" and explore the richness of Ray's portrayl of symbolism and quiet desparation. In the recent North American curiousity of Bollywood films, Pather Panchali is NOT this. Rather, this film is a  genuine masterpiece that will be treasured for generations.",9
16,16 August 2021,review_forum,8, Beauty Lies In The Detailing.,"This film is based on the the Bengali novel ""Pather Panchali"" by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay. It is hard to believe Satyajit Ray made his directorial debut with this film. The movie itself is the evidence what Satyajit Ray was capable of. Story is simple but the things that make the film great are its soulful scenes without using dialogues, camera work technically very much ahead of its time and the background score by Pandit Ravi Shankar setting the tone for the movie. The style of detailings used in this film help us to connect with the film. Cinematography and believable acting are the strength of this film. No wonder why Martin Scorsese was a great admirer of Satyajit Ray's work.",1
17,7 May 1999,Rigor,10, One of the most accomplished narrative films ever made.,"Pather Panchali is simply one of the most perfectly executed narrative films ever made. It is an extraordinary experience that really should be witnessed to be appreciated. The evocation of a specific place and time balanced with a profoundly ""universal"" humanism draws viewers into this film in intensely personal ways. This is one of the few films that has elicted some kind of respectful response from every person that I have talked to about it. Simply a masterpiece.",/
18,15 May 2006,silverlion3411,9, A film of Quiet Perspective and Natural Beauty.,"""Pather Panchali"", Satyajit Ray's debut film about life in a Bengali village, was the first movie from India to gain wide recognition and acclaim in the west. It is an affecting story of a rural family struggling to deal with poverty and tragedy in their ancestral home. Ray adapted the script from Bibhuti Bihushaw Banerjee's semi-autobiographical novel of the same title and retells it with natural beauty and a quiet perspective. The filmmaker, who came from a literary and artistic background(He was a product of the Indian Renaissance) was interested in the contemporary problems of his country-and he shared with the Neorealist films from Italy- a simple and direct approach to making movies. Ray created ordinary scenes that were incredibly life-like. His films contained very few strains of artifice. He believed that the raw material of cinema was life itself. Ray generally concentrated on small subjects and ordinary people. He favored using non-actors and shooting on location to heighten the realism. He made films in his own style; dignified and subtle; sincere and with a conscience. In ""Pather Panchali"" (Song of the Little Road"") Ray makes superb use of his milieu. The viewer immediately feels the cramped conditions of the families' decaying house and the open-air confines of the surrounding forest. When Ray sends his camera beyond the village, the observer can sense the allure and freedom of the vast fields that spring immodestly from a thin, winding trail. Rays' was a cinema of thought and feeling, in which emotion was deliberately restrained because it is so strong. This restraint adds to the psychological intensity in his work. Nearly all of his films are marked by this remarkable depth of feeling. ""Pather Panchali"", the first installment of the Apu Trilogy(""Aparajito"" and ""The World of Apu"" would follow) depicts a young boy (Apu) exploring his ever-expanding universe with a growing sense of wonder. Ray excelled at showing how children and adolescents confront mystery and joy; sadness and death. The director shows Apu's burgeoning awareness with a masterful use of the long shot. High-angled, distant shots track Apu and his older sister Durga, as they run spiritedly through white-kashed fields. This sense of discovery gives the film it's emotional power. The director's main subject was India-it's customs and culture. It's conflicts between the traditional way of life and the impact and influence of the West. He tried arduously to capture this synthesis between western ideas and traditional Hindu values. His concern for human problems and not issues of national politics gave his films universal appeal. ""Pather Panchali"" delineates the small joys and acute sorrows of a poor Indian family. It is an endearing testament that poverty does not nullify love and that even the most afflicted person can find some modest pleasures in their world. The film's indigenous sound track is vital to Ray's story of ancestral limitations. Twanging ektaras, wailing tarshehnais and six-stringed sitars resound liberally throughout the movie. It would be difficult to imagine ""Pather Panchali"" without it's memorable score. Satyajit Ray was an unpretentious filmmaker. He was genuinely uninterested in commercial considerations. His films were life-affirming, authentic and honest; gentle and poetic- truthful observations on human behavior that employed simple but strong themes. Ray's unadorned style of film-making was intimate, probing, and revealing. (Possible spoiler) The final scene shows the grieving family leaving their home in an ox-driven carriage to begin a new life. A trailing camera in medium close-up captures a compelling mixture of emotions on their faces. Expressions of pain and resolution; hope and despair; the future and the past. A seemingly simple yet unmistakably powerful scene that typifies Satyajit Ray's profound cinema. A cinema of gentle but deep observation, understanding and unabashed love of the human race.",?
19,7 May 2005,frolicer,10, simply wonderful,"...it is one of those greatest works of art..so lyrical yet so composed. there is one phrase that Ray has used extensively in his writings; something that his professor use to say when he was studying painting in Shantiniketan: ""look at Fujiyama, Fire within and Calm without. There is the symbol of true oriental artist..."" i think it best describes Ray's work where he suggests in his cinema enormous reserves of power and feelings which never spill into emotional displays.",r

23,13 May 2021,planktonrules,4, I really wanted to like this one more than I did.,"I am a big fan of many Italian Neo-realist films, particularly films by De Sica, such as ""The Children Are Watching Us"" and ""Umberto D."" and I have really enjoyed several of Indian director Satyajit Ray, such as ""The Big City""...so I assumed I would enjoy ""Pather Panchali"". After all, Parallel Cinema (also called 'New Indian Cinema') is India's answer to this style of film which uses real folks (non actors) in realistic situations. But, as I watched, I was shocked that I did not like this film. I felt oddly disconnected from it and at odds with the film experts who see ""Pather Panchali"" as a classic. Heck, it's currently the highest rated Indian film on IMDB....yet I just didn't like it. I felt the film was very, very slow and I had a hard time focusing on the story...mostly because there really wasn't much of one. These people are very poor, generally miserable and it just felt oppressive.",=

Anybody remotely connected with movie making should also watch APARAJITO AND APUR SANSAR, to complete the experience, and off course to understand the art and craft of cinematic expression from the Maestro.

The reason I became a film maker.  The essential element here is, I think, humility.  Humility in the eyes of one's fellow man, in the eyes of a higher common spirit. Puts to shame the common ego on display by most directors. Ray puts his characters, their story, their humanity before all else.

Part three, ""The World of Apu,"" seems a bit flawed by sentimentality and overly melodramatic qualities, but is still a masterpiece, if a more minor one. ""Pather Panchali"" is visual and moral poetry, and provides enough thought-provoking material to last a lifetime--or more.  Meditation on the human truths exposed in these three films can be a very salutary thing. Satyajit Ray was one of the very great moral-centered filmmakers--which is not to say he's preachy or condescending, just the opposite: he does what great dramatists have always done from the Greeks through Shakespeare and onward, which is to search the human soul, compassionately revealing its weaknesses and strengths so that each member of the audience, if attentive, may learn more about himself or herself.",

There are some truly beautiful scenes in the natural surroundings where the family live, and the cinematography is wonderful. The family members are striking as well, starting with the grandmother (Chunibala Devi), who with her withered face and stooped back, has quite an appearance.

42,28 April 2016,Hitchcoc,10, How Can One See and Not Be Changed,"I have waited a long time to view this trilogy. I finally managed to get a copy at my local library and just viewed the first part. This is such a subtle, graphic portrayal of life in India in the Fifties (an probably today). In a small village, a family is just barely keeping going. A man, his wife, and their two children live on a subsistence level, trying not to starve. He is a man of honor and, on the word of a neighbor that his family was owed money, has given over an orchard to them. This may or may not be true. Now when his daughter steals a bit of fruit from the orchard, she is branded a thief. The man is an idealist. He is a poet and playwright who is optimistic that his work will be published or performed. Meanwhile, he works for nothing, trusting his employer to give him back wages. The family lives on handfuls of rice, also looking out for an ancient aunt. They are shunned by neighbors. The wife takes on the huge burden of the family, respecting the wishes of her husband, but knowing that he is a hopeless romantic. Apu, for whom the trilogy is named, is a little boy who manages to kee constantly on the move. He is sensitive and hard to read. His sister realizes that her peers will get married and have a better life, but she is convinced this will never happen for her (their economic state pretty much assures this.). This film is technically magnificent. Ray does things with the camera that are so on point. The black and white photography is stunning. His close-ups of the locals are masterful. We live and die with the family, hoping things will get better. The father is sort of Hindu priest who goes to another city to perform a religious ceremony for a rich man and disappears for over five months. Upon his return he is devastated by horrible news. The story of this family will now move on to another place for Part 2. It is as much about the human spirit as any film I've seen.",

Akira Kurusawa, the man behind Japanese classics like Rashomon and Ran rightly said years ago that living in a world without having seen a Satyajit Ray film is similar to living without having seen the sun or moon; almost every film I've watched feels effete after living in Ray's world. It is a transcending experience watching the late Bengali director's debut effort Pather Panchali, one that deeply impacts the very core of your soul in a way that makes you feel afterwards as though you've lived two lives ‚Äì one before having watched Pather Panchali and one after. It achieves the remarkable feat of invoking your senses to a higher state of consciousness; the experience watching Pather Panchali is similar to reading Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace or some of William Blake's or Emily Dickinson's finest achievements, or watching Meryl Streep's iconic turn as Sophie Zawistowski in Sophie's Choice. The feeling is so powerful that it took me more than an hour to get back to my original state; the hardest part for me was to return the DVD to the movie rental store because I knew the true worth of what I was holding. May god bless the guy who recognized Pather Panchali's worth years ago and preserved the original prints so the world today can have a chance to be transported to the precious little magical world of Apu, the film's protagonist.

The noble family in decline, the crumbling family house, the steady, overpowering incremence of nature onto civilisation, the generational conflict where the hopes of youth are tainted with decadence of the past, the climactic storm scene that brings everything to a head.  These are all staples of the Gothic story, and although the world of the film blazes in an intolerable sun, the film itself is shrouded in ominous, often impenetrable shadows (although, admittedly, the print I saw was very saturated).

It is a big slice-of-life drama that doesn't exactly follow a narrative, but hits on some of the highlights (or should I say lowlights) of their menial existence.

Basically it is the 1920s in Bengal, in the village Nischindipur, and the story focuses on the impoverished Ray family. Wife and mother Sarbojaya (Karuna Bannerjee) takes care of the home and the two children while husband and father Harihar (Kanu Bannerjee) earns the meagre money from being a priest. Sarbojaya finds living in the home hard when she has to share it with very old, toothless and hunchbacked cripple sister-in-law Indirtharkun (Chunibala Devi), especially when accepting stolen fruit from her children. Sarbojaya's children, daughter Durga (Runki Bannerjee and Uma Dasgupta) and son Apu (Subir Bannerjee) have a close relationship, and they enjoy sitting quietly under trees, chasing a candy seller, running about through the surrounding Kaash fields, and catching a glimpse of the passing trains. After many irritations with the fruit stealing and just being around, Aunt Indir is found dead in the bushes, and Harihar meanwhile is travelling abroad to find a better paying job. While he is gone the family sink further into poverty, with Sarbojaya becoming lonely, and worse, Durga develops a cold and fever from rainfall, from which she dies. When Harihar returns home he and Sarbojaya burst into tears because of Durga's death, and in the end, Apu finds a necklace that Durga denied stealing, which he throws in the pond, and they all ride away to their new destination.

Panther Panchali describes the world from the view point of a young child with dreams, imagination, interpretation of the world around him and his encounters with reality through the characters around him and the surrounding. This makes the movie a well balanced mixture of revelations of realism and the imagery interpretation of that realism through the mind and eyes of a young child Apu. This very fact also provides the film with a simplicity and flow that is very striking while at the same time bringing out the hopes and sadness, happiness and struggle of a newly emergent nation, primarily rural society based, still struggling and striving to raise itself to a higher level. It is reality interspersed and woven through imagination and hope, the striving for a betterment, the eternal flow of the path of life through hopes and struggle of a common Indian poverty stricken rural family which is the striking reality of a nascent nation where even today more than 70% of the population live and die in the same abject poverty yet resilient enough to hope and endeavor for amelioration of their social status, a better life. This hope for better future has been nicely portrayed at the end of the movie when the whole family move out of the village in search of a better life in the city in-spite of their losses and uncertainties. The whole movie has a poetry like characteristics in its unfolding of the realism woven through imagination of a young boy and his striking encounters with the real world and its malaise through incidents like the death of his sister with whom he shared a very sweet relationship, his revelation of the theft of his sister after her death and the though that flows through his mind and his act of throwing the same in the pond in an attempt to consciously deny and forget the negativity in his beloved world surrounding him, his first encounter with the modern world of steam engine and trains, etc. The skillful screenplay and the wonderful musical tune in the movie has definitely helped in bringing out the central flow of the incidents and the inner meaning of the movie. It is eternal in nature and not really confined to a particular family, time or place, it brings out the very real and everyday story of millions in similar surroundings in Indian society. This is a movie which leaves you thinking and filled sweet and melancholy emotions after you have finished watching. This movie stands out for the very fact that it brings out the striking harsh reality in a sweet and nice manner like a poetry, a musical tune, the tune of life of millions.",

Her elderly cousin, Indir, whom the family calls ""Auntie,"" is a poor old woman who can barely see or walk, and Sarbojaya treats her miserably, eventually driving her away and forcing her to die alone in the woods. The woman's husband, Harihar Ray, comes across as a slacker and a dreamer (he thinks he can make money by writing plays), but maybe he is just a victim of the caste system. Her daughter, Durga, is a thief, but she is likable. Finally, there is Apu, who will play a larger role in the sequels. After his sister dies, Apu destroys something she stole so no one will know, even though everyone really knows anyway.

Perhaps not ""Citizen Kane"", but pretty darn close, this autobiographical film from Satyajit Ray, the first of a trilogy, is many things...a bildungsroman, an intense family drama, a harshly lyrical picture of rural life...but for me what it most vividly and powerfully evokes is the awfulness of poverty, the sheer misery of not having enough; enough money, treats (forget luxuries), clothes, sanitation, decent medical care, education, and, perhaps most crucially for someone as naturally curious about life as is Apu, exposure to the world outside that stultifying village in which he must spend his youth, with only a passing glimpse at a train to serve as an escape valve. And Ray gives us this bitter pill without sugar coating, a la Hollywood depictions of poverty (No charming Bowery Boys here). Yes, there are occasional moments of happiness but they are fleeting, while misery, in the shape of death and hopelessness, can always be counted on swiftly to return. And the film's last shot, with the reduced family being forced to flee out of economic necessity, in an ox cart, to the city, as they stare hollowly into the future, is as utterly bleak an ending as you will find. Not much more to add except that Karuna Banarjee ,who portrayed the mother, by far the most complex member of the family, with her combination of love, hard heartedness, hopefulness and resentment, should have won the Oscar given to Grace Kelly for ""The Country Girl"", the kind of Hollywood hokum for which this film is the perfect antidote, and that people who find this film ""slow"" should be consigned to an eternity of watching ""Smokey And The Bandit"".

It's not that I didn't feel bad for the impoverished family's circumstances at the center of the story, but it's resolution at the finale leaves no sense of reconciliation or hope for the viewer. It's as if the picture seeks to confirm a statement by one of Sarbojaya Ray's (Karune Bannerjee) neighbors near the finale when she states that life in their dirt poor village was like 'rotting away in one place year after year'. I felt the movie was more about daughter Durga (Uma Das Gupta) than about her younger brother Apu (Subir Banerjee), as described in the IMDb 'Storyline' description on this movie's title page, though the emphasis does shift when she is unfortunately taken ill and perishes. I found it inspiring the way Apu decided to insure Durga's reputation and legacy by throwing away the stolen necklace that was a focal event early in the picture. Knowing now that this film was the first in a trilogy by director Satyajit Ray, the emphasis on Apu does make more sense.

It's a slice-of-life affair that chronicles the lives of a family struggling to survive in rural Bengal. The father is an optimistic priest whose gentle nature and general desire to maintain his relaxed reputation often lead to periods of immense poverty, something which is made worse when an opportunity in the city takes him away for far too long. The mother is a pragmatic, if not downright pessimistic, presence who holds everything together with all her might but can't escape her reputation no matter how hard she tries. The children play innocently, unable to see the severity of their situation (even rejecting food in favour of play on occasion), and their happiness is touching even if it's constantly drenched in portent. The picture has as many moments of joy as it does of sadness, but its overall vibe is undeniably downbeat. It progresses almost as a series of vignettes, depicting the passage of time ambiguously and refusing to provide on-the-nose exposition when it comes to who is who in relation to each other (which is actually a bit of an issue sometimes). It's an experience that's far easier to admire than it is to enjoy, especially when you look into its behind-the-scenes process and realise it was shot on a shoestring budget over a period of three years by people who had never made a movie before. Shot with a deceptive simplicity, the black-and-white feature often feels as close to a fly-on-the-wall documentary as a narrative affair can. It's an impressive effort, for sure. Though the acting occasionally falls a little flat (and isn't helped by the sometimes emotionally unconvincing screenplay), most of characters are convincing in a down-to-Earth way. The drama works as well as it does because of this realistic nature, even if the detached style prevents the piece from being as devastating as it could have been. In fact, it generally feels sort of hollow. It's very slow and, though its pacing improves in its back half, it could have probably done with a bit of its runtime shaving off. It's conceptually solid and technically sound, but it isn't exactly an enthralling or, even, especially enjoyable experience. It's entertaining on occasion and it does what it sets out to, but it just isn't as affecting as it ought to have been. With some tightening up, it could've been a real tearjerker.

This timeless story of a young boys maturation into a young adult is poignant and joyful, silly and serious, painful and glorious. It is all of these things and much more. It captures the atmosphere of the countryside in Bengal, and then it contrasts that peaceful, quiet environment with the hustle and bustle of opportunity that is represented by Calcutta. Young people generally do not care for peace and quiet; they desire the excitement and activity of the big city. They want to seek opportunity. And that is what our protagonist is seeking.

Ray's methodology is very emotive and tonal, working from drawings rather than a script, and parts of this feel so startlingly real that at times it's hard to believe you're watching fiction at all.

Also, films are one sided and not two way as people on screen and behind keep exhibiting their talent and we the viewers have no participation (example in sports-Tennis or Chess is two sided). But recently got inspired to come back into my favorite arena-(parallel) movies(commonly/colloquially known as non song movies, award cinema, art film, documentary, slow movies, elite film festival audience movie) after getting inspired from a TV show accidentally i watched while changing channel, where Indian film director told that his favorite personality is Satyajit Ray(a veteran with Oscar and Bharat Ratna to his credit). While saying there was a special spark in his eyes. Then i came back to this movie called Pather Panchali - Song of the little road(1955) which was released 61 years ago(was in development hell for 3 years indeed), which is Mr.Ray's first movie with no experience in films except for watching, analyzing and discussing them.

110,12 May 2020,andrewroy-04316,7," Slow and meditative, but a technically excellent and thoughtful slice of life film","Pather Panchali requires patience and thoughtful engagement with its characters, but it rewards you for it. It's a slow moving slice of life film about an Indian family, particularly a mother and daughter. I think De Sica would be proud of this one, as it does feel extremely similar stylistically to Bicycle Thieves. Few real events happen in the film - instead, we just spend time with the characters as they struggle to get by and enjoy the small things in life. In this way, it reminded me of a wonderful recent slice of life movie: The Florida Project. In both, we understand the parental struggle to balance emotional, financial, and parenting stability for their kids, and we also get many scenes shot from the children's perspective, where these wonderful kids living in extreme poverty see simple things in the world with utter awe. The bond between Apu and Durga was very pleasant, and the way all the characters reacted to the ending was realistic and heartbreaking. One small directorial choice I loved was the mirroring of how Durga woke Apu up at the beginning and how she found Auntie dead - shaking them while there was a blanket over them, with the music in the early scene hinting at darkness. There's a lot to get out of this one thematically in regards to family, tradition, and what defines a community, but you have to be ready for the slow, contemplative pace.",
111,29 October 2022,madanmarwah,8," A classic revisited. Realistic, artistic, lyrical.","It is after many years that I again saw this much celebrated and awarded classic of Satyajit Ray. The raw realism and mesmerizing lyrical quality is intact. Movie making has since undergone a paradigm shift both in terms of content and techniques but the outstanding quality of this movie has remained unmatched over the years. All iconic scenes have been discussed and analysed many times over. Director Satyajit Ray along with cinematographer Subtata Mitra and music director Ravi Shankar created great cinema which had come in for praise by established auteurs of the likes of Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan. (Ray himself was an admirer of prominent Italian director Vittorio De Sica). All actors have acted superbly and are under the skin of the characters. The camera work is first rate capturing the scenery of the village with great artistry. The close ups are superbly done and tell a lot. Memorable scenes include the train scene, Apu getting ready for school, the storm shaking up the home, the wedding, the sweetmeat seller, the death of the old woman, the makeshift village drama, the shopkeeper cum teacher, the rains, the sibling banter and many more. As far as technique goes the trolley shots, the close ups, the dissolves and the fade in/ fade out in the scenes reflect the signature style of Ray. (Later Ray is said to have remarked that he would like to try out the emerging European style of hand held camera, jump cut and freeze frame.) The plot of a very poor man living in a dilapidated home with his wife, two kids and a sister in her 90s spoke of abject poverty, sickness, hunger and misery. This did not go well with some people as they felt that it depicted poverty in India. Right from the simplistic credit titles in Bengali to the the village atmosphere to melodious music of flute/ sitar, the movie was totally Indian in all aspects. Certain social aberrations of middle class India of those times shown effectively include the pampered boy child, the domesticated girl child and the neglected senior of the house.",

117,7 October 2020,WorldMovie99,9, Unenlightening and serene !,"The movie though made in 1950s, still relatable to today's world. Doesn't matter whether they are in urban or rural. It basically shows the family's rural life. The rural world, being unenlightened is shown strongly in the role of the little girl, who dies shortly. The old lady which is highly praiseworthy for her genuine involvement is still mystifying. I generally liked the dual sense hidden in the girls life. The father longs to earn money in the urban apart from his poetic abilities. The death of the little girl in the whole episode is so true even in the metaphorical sense. The girl represents the unenlightening existence. She is peaceful in rural life, sometimes gets scold from her mother. She has her private space in the movie, plays around the village, the natural experiences of her teenage. The scenario of the rural area matches in total of the girl unenlightened existence. She dies peacefully in rural area is a thought provoking issue regarding both fear and peace hidden in her life. It strikes me as the metaphor of unenlightening super power ends in the beginning of 20th century. A truly maestro's touch by Satyajit Ray in visualizations through human characters. Apart from that all the performers truly did thier part reflecting the genuine rural life of east India.",

Realism takes new unseen heights in the film with it's artists, be it Appu, Durga, their mother or the old woman who effortlessly sweeps us off from all our assumptions on acting and actors. Despite all this I think the greatest strength of this movie is it's 'timelessness' I haven't seen any film from the 50s or even the 'Hitchcock'ian 60s that are as timeless as Pather Panchali. This fact that the film stays authentic and relevant in all aspects even today in 2021 is something that we all need to be experience and wonder !",

Movie is about life and how does it go on. Even though it has been cited to showcase poverty, I do not see that is ever pinpointed anywhere in the film, and there is no crying over it. This film actually does not say much. Some western critics mentioned about the theme of endless sorrow throughout the series, but I do not think this was made, or could be interpreted in that way. That kind of sorrow is part of the then life in our country. Let us not take the ending as a cliffhanger. Kudos to the actors too, but Ray even played the role of casting director well.

125,17 November 2020,clintav,9, most influenced movie for a 15 year old,"Films are the outcome of thoughts and imagination of many people bringing together an art that would stimulate the minds of their viewers. A film is an art form which can profoundly have an impact on society.
Films have a lot of influence on me. Growing up watching movies of foreign languages and different cultures have helped me to approach the world more broadly and to accept the diversities. I moved to the United States from India few years ago. Because of the films and the books I have read, to an extent, I was able to adapt very quickly into this society and embrace the cultural differences.
When I was in 10th grade, my teacher screened the film ""PatherPanjali""(1955 )directed by Satyajit Ray which was adapted from an autobiographical tale written by author Bibhuthibhushan Bandyopadhyay in 1929. The movie is about a Brahmin family, an impoverished priest (Harihar Ray), his wife and two children ( Durga and Apu) struggling to make both ends meet. Though the film deals with the struggle for survival by a poor family, what the director has tried to project instead is the respect for human dignity. The film as a whole seems tragic but it is a lot more than that. It is full of love, care, share and humanity that is fading away in this current era. The director has used the cues and signals from nature at it's best for picturizing the mood of the scenes. Despite the movie was dated for my generation (come on! What does 15-year-old know about film appreciation), unlike my classmates, during the film I was in a different emotional state. That was the first time I see the struggles of poor old villagers who even steal Guavas to calm the hunger and later on takes one's life. That was the first time I see how social status and pride overrules the humanity. Watching those scenes made me sick in my heart. At the same time, even in adverse circumstances, the children enjoy their childhood, sharing, caring and living in the moment exploring and exposing the mountains, rivers and the forest happily made me question whether the inconveniences I had is even a matter to consider. After the movie was over, I felt ashamed of myself for being ungrateful towards such a beautiful life I live. This movie made me question why people choose pride over dignity (the mother's pride took precedence over daughter's death) or is those words are some thing that is often misintrepret all the time.
This movie completely shifted my approach towards cinema. After that film, I always try to pick movies that stir intense emotions and reach me at a deeper level.",

127,17 June 2015,axb,10, The first and the best of the Apu Trilogy,"Last weekend it was my fortune to see the entire Apu trilogy at the DIA Film Theater. It was a pleasure and relief after reading stories of burned negatives of Satyajit Ray films and anxiety that seeing his films again after 40 years may be a disappointment. I had seen a clutch of his films at a festival in Bombay and had seen Pather Pancheli again in late 70's as a student in U.S. I had not seen the other two films in the trilogy, Aparajito and Apur Sansar before. It was great to see all three films in a two day span, but this also helped me obtain perspective on this great filmmaker. Pather Panchali is superlatively great. Nothing in Indian film repertoire approaches it for its freshness, naturalness, authenticity, playfulness and ability to relate its experience to the audience. Words are inadequate to describe how affecting Chunibala Devi is as an 80 year old close to death. She walks back and forth from being a beggar/thief to a loving aunt to Apu and Durga. In the extreme conditions she lives in, there is no contradiction in the two roles. Subeer Banerjee as Apu is absolutely charming and Uma Dasgupta as Durga with her rebelliousness and budding sexuality breaks our heart. The photography of Subrata Mitra has few equals in B/W film world. It is not only beautiful; it finds beauty in the most unexpected places such as tattered huts and dark unlit interiors; but is also expressive and lyrical. Ravi Shanker's music is mostly enchanting, but occasionally a little too overpowering for the gentleness of the scene. Kanu Banerjee as the hopelessly romantic father and Karuna Banerjee as the ever suffering mother are excellent.",

I don't want miss Christopher movies at any cost, when he admires Ray picture then started curiosity inside. Ray is big great director i know after he praised the movie i watched all three movies . The Appu Triology this movie is first part.
In 50's indian director created magic and made a sequel 3 parts a big trend set up in old days. Nowadays are part 1 part 2 movies are making so feel great but Ray sir did 60+yrs back.
Coming to Appu stroy i love like madly his story narration. I remembered so many my childhood moments. A poor family but so happily at home. Im wondering still now how he grabbed middle class low class mentality and their life. On Screen he made everything great, Screenplay, story and what not. When i m watching this movie Boyhood movie , this movie captured a boy story since childhood to adult boy. But Appu story took three parts to explain a character. Ray got two national film awards out of three movie. Wow what a great attempt and succeeded finally.

The story is human at its best and yet we find the drama so engaging that we see the bits of our lives in them. Being a story of a family living in a rural village and the hardship they have to go through because of the poverty and unemployment ,it skins down the human emotions of the character at it's naked best and hence the whole plot seems so universal. The camera does the talking here more than any dialogue of the film the way the staging is done and kudos to the man behind The lens Subatra Mitra owing to the fact that he has never filmed a movie prior to this work I'll have to say he does a tremendous job technically as well as artistically the performances are outstanding . The actor seem like they were made for the very particular role they play and the touch of classical score scored by Mr Ravi Shankar himself does the defining work of inducing emotions in each scene.

Can someone believe that Pather Panchali is a debut for this creator? Pather Panchali, is truly a remarkable masterpiece that is carved with brilliant film making. It leaves us awestruck and scene by scene is a sculpture. I do not recollect when was the last time that I watched an Indian film that portrays reality to this extent. It's been almost 60 years since the release of Pather Panchali but no other movie can inch closer to this marvel. Epic performance from the entire cast. Editing was top notch, so was the cinematography. If you want to become a film maker, you don't have to go to a film school, just watch the trilogy. This movie is very precious for the Indian cinema and will be cherished forever.",

More people would rather talk about this film than watch it carefully. The film misses the ""Ballali Balai"" part of the novel by Bibhutibhushan which is a must read for a complete picture of the background of the film. Bibhuti's novel consists of three parts, a) Ballali Balai, b) Aam anti-r bhnepu, c) Akrura Sangbad. Ray covers Aam aanti-r bhnepu in ""Pather Panchali"" film and the ""AKrur Sangbad"" deals with the first half of ""Aparajito"" which ends with Harihara's death.",

156,18 July 2020,surajitbanerjee,10, The movie that holds the respect of India cinema,"Directed by: Satyajit Ray
The realist narrative style of ""Pather Panchali"" was influenced by Italian neorealism and the works of French director Jean Renoir.
The story deals with ; A poor Brahmin family in rural Bengal, India in the 1920s deals with life's struggles but the two children, Durga and Apu, manage to find joy in the simplest things.
Director Satyajit Ray keeps a very smooth and gentle flow moving in this film. Even the smallest of situations can be made to be eventful. His camera helps us to experience the beauty of such things as a wind blowing against a field or lifting lily pads in a river. The best part of this movie was ' when Apu and Durga saw the train from the paddy field . The mood is greatly aided by the sweet musical score by Ravi Shankar especially when the sitar is played.
In its sequel, "" The second film, ""Aparajito"" (1956), follows the family to Benares, where the father makes a living from pilgrims who have come to bathe in the holy Ganges. The third film, ""Apur Sansar"" (1959), finds Apu and his mother living with an uncle in the country; the boy does so well in school he wins a scholarship to Calcutta. He is married under extraordinary circumstances, is happy with his young bride, then crushed by the deaths of his mother and his wife. After a period of bitter drifting, he returns at last to take up the responsibility of his son. the trilogy, tragedy strikes without warning, and Apu's real challenge is an existential one-how to go on in the face of life's fragile and temporary nature. The great, sad, gentle sweep of ""The Apu Trilogy"" remains in the mind of the moviegoer as a promise of what film can be. Standing above fashion, it creates a world so convincing that it becomes, for a time, another life we might have lived.
The three films were photographed by Subrata Mitra, a still photographer who Satyajit Ray was convinced could do the job.
""The Apu Trilogy"" is a different kind of life than we are used to. The film is set in Bengal in the 1920s, when in the rural areas life was traditional and hard. Relationships were formed with those who lived close by; there is much drama over the theft of some apples from an orchard.
I am blessed to watch this three movies of ""The Apu Trilogy"" by Satyajit Ray, which enhence me a lot. These are among the most beautiful, richly human movies ever made-essential works for any film lover. It would move even the most still of hearts, the impact is felt well after the film's conclusion. One powerful technique Ray uses is to have the camera on the faces of two people simultaneously where one is aware of the shocking event while the other is blissfully ignorant.",
