0,3 September 2010,claudio_carvalho,9, Unforgettable and Heartbreaking Bleak Tale of Friendship and Loneliness,"In 1976, in Australia, the misfit and outcast eight-year old girl Mary Daisy Dinkle lives in Mount Waverley with her alcoholic shoplifter mother Vera Lorraine Dinkle that is addicted in Sherry and her absent father Noel Norman Dinkle that works in the Earl Grey Factory attaching strings in the teabag and spends his leisure time in his hobby - taxidermy. Mary has absolutely no friends and is teased by her schoolmate Benny Clifford. She has a complex because of her brown birthmark in the forehead and she adores her favorite cartoon The Noblets that she watches with her rooster Ethel and condensed milk. Meanwhile, in New York, the lonely forty-four year-old Max Jerry Horowitz has Asperge Syndrome and trouble to sleep and is obese since he eats chocolate hot-dogs to compensate his anxiety. He frequently goes to the Overeaters Anonymous Meeting. Max does not have any friend, only the invisible Mr. Ravioli, and also loves The Noblets. His life goals are to have a friend, Noblets and chocolate. One day, Mary picks Max address out of an American phone-book and she decides to write to him to ask from where babies come in America. Along their lives, they become pen pals and their unusual friendship oscillates due to the anxiety attacks of the unstable Max.",/
1,10 April 2009,Likes_Ninjas90,8, Refreshing and engaging given the home-grown talent involved.,"In Australia in 1976, a young girl named Mary (voiced by Bethany Whitmore) is a lonely child looking for a friend. She lives with both her parents but her mother is a chain smoking drunk and a thief and her father, who works in a factory putting the strings on teabags, would rather spend time with his collection of dead birds. Mary remains curious about life and finds the address of an American living in New York. She writes him a letter to become his pen pal. The recipient is Max (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a severely overweight Jewish hypochondriac and full-time no-hoper. Gradually, as they send each other letters, Mary and Max's relationship develops and we begin to learn more about their past and their heartache and insecurities of being alone.",r
2,14 April 2009,MatthewInSydney,8, Mary & Max - wonderfully unique and personal animation,"There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory.",e
3,25 October 2020,Xstal,8," Solitude, Isolation & Loneliness...","Masterfully directed, edited and animated to pique your interest from the off, it has you falling into the worlds of Mary and Max and sharing their challenging journeys through life, as well as their genuine, realistic and engaging correspondence and gifts to each other. Stuffed full of sad and sorrowful events, the solitude and isolation felt by both characters is palpable all the way through. Not really a film to make you smile but one that will make you think and that, after all, is what the best of storytelling is really all about.",v
4,22 March 2010,manicman84,10, lovely oddball and admirably complex,"Coming from Australia, Mary and Max is one of these few films you'll remember all your life. This amazing claymation touches upon an unlikely friendship between two pen pals: a young girl living in Australia and an aging Jew from New York. It's unbelievable what a precisely structured narrative this is. Director-writer Adam Elliot blends odd scatological, yet clever humour with poignant dramatizations to a splendid effect creating one of the best tragicomedies of the past few years. The fact that it's in the form of claymation only helps to enhance uniqueness of the whole experience. The movie was 5 years in the making and this is visible in its every frame. Elliot masterly captures the motion in an endlessly creative manner. Most importantly though, his lovably oddball characters are well developed and admirably complex with all their awkward traits and quirks. Due to its serious themes and dark tone, Mary and Max is an adult movie aiming much higher than its big studio counterparts. It happens to be more contemplative, and intelligent mimicking the real life with all its ups and downs. Calling Elliot's movie an extraordinary piece of art is certainly not an overstatement.",i

7,1 January 2011,planktonrules,10," After seeing his previous films, I just had to watch this one...","Having already watched several of Adam Elliot's other films (""Harvey Krumpet"", ""Brother"", ""Cousin"" and ""Uncle""), I felt a strong compulsion to watch ""Mary and Max"". After all, these other films were wonderful and very original and you find yourself hooked when you watch them--though you probably won't know why. Now, with Elliot's latest film, I have a chance to finally watch a feature-length version of his wonderful and very strange work.",/
8,21 August 2009,ori_64,10," So excellent, that I couldn't recommend it more!","It's hard to describe just how excellent this film is. The story is great, both very funny and touching. The art-design and animation are a delight, thoughtful, very rich in details, and very consistent in style. The music is great. The storyline and direction... I can't find a bad word to say, except that the story drags a little half- way through, but then picks itself up again toward the end. Truly, a must-see. If you like adult animation, this is definitely for you. I agree with those comparing it to Aardman films, Waltz with Bashir and Persepolis, but this movie's animation is so professional, that only Aardman truly compares.",r
9,6 March 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, Unforgettable,"One of my favourites of 2009, Mary and Max is a truly unforgettable film in all respects. The clay animation is just gorgeous with all the characters well modelled and the colours done in atmospheric shades, and gives a nostalgic and unique feel to it, and the music is beautiful and heart-breaking. The characters add a lot to the film as well, the title characters are sweet, emphatic and engaging, with Mary very cute and Max endearing in his own way, and the audience sympathises with them and their predicaments, while the writing is both funny and poignant and the haunting, affecting and personal story packs a real emotional punch on its own and is thematically quite deep. The voice work is top notch, Barry Humphries provides a both amusing and gentle narrative and Toni Collette(Bethany Whitmore as the younger Mary) and Phillip Seymour Hoffmann are brilliant as Mary and Max. What made Mary and Max other than the superb direction and gentle pacing was the adept mix of hilarious humour and poignant drama, there is evidence of both and both are done wonderfully. Overall, a beautiful, unforgettable film with a 10/10. Bethany Cox",w
10,16 February 2009,asphodelfilms,8," Witty, well observed and wondrous",I went into this film at the Berlinale with mixed feelings.

14,28 September 2018,invisibleunicornninja,8, Pretty great,"I hate it when people assume that animation can only be for little kids. Why should an entire medium be relegated to a demographic unlikely to fully appreciate all the work that went into the detail and animation of this stop-motion world? That's not to say that children can't watch this movie - anything ""inappropriate"" will likely go over their heads - but it is a bit depressing. ",6
15,5 May 2020,gbill-74877,8, Touching,"Because of some of the crass bits early on, I was a little worried that this was going to be a little too dark for my taste, but it turned out to be quite a touching portrait of loneliness and those with Asperger's. To feel isolated in the world, and yet to have an improbable friend in a pen-pal you've never met - just to know they're out there and to hear from them as you trundle through life - the connection is meaningful and beautiful. The film is also visually striking, and I loved the voices from Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Toni Colette.",2

17,14 November 2009,dbborroughs,10, Moving story of two misfits is one of the best films of 2009,"Its been 24 hours since I've seen Mary and Max and find I've been deeply affected by the film. Its the story of a little girl who needs to know somethings so she writes a letter to a random person in America only to connect with an sweet man with some decided peculiar ways. What happens after that is a series of ups and downs that happen over the course of 20 years. A unique film its possibly the best animated film from 2009, and its one of the best films of the year. Rarely has a film left me so emotionally moved, certainly there are even fewer that have made me feel this way many hours after the fact. I feel as though I'm carrying the characters and emotions around inside me. And in a way I'm at a loss for words. A beautifully animated film with dialog that is witty and wise and wonderful, this is a marvelously made film. However its the characters where it shines. All of the characters, even if they are somewhat cliché, are painfully real. We know someone like everyone of them. Your heart goes out to them and is carried by them because they are so real. Its the characters we remember and we return to and who carry the film even as the second half gets messy. A masterpiece.",/

But there is something which makes them care about and think about each other. It is the great relation of friendship. We hear that our best friends are those who accept us along with our faults and shortcomings. Mary and Max are the best examples of that. Mary is a 8 year old girl from Australia and Max is a 40 somewhat obese guy from New York. Both have some things common such as they have no friends, love a particular Cartoon and have the fetish for Chocolate. They interact with each other through letters which reveals to the viewer their life story .Sorry, if I missed to mention that this is an animated movie - Not ordinary but clay animation. It is somewhat difficult to emote through clay animation but this movie does not suffer from that. The movie is filled with dark, satirical humor but you never feel offended by it. Along with it, it has it's 'cry buckets' moments which really move you. I will certainly call it a very matured animation movie by a newbie director. It is right up there in my list of favorite animations.",e

The creator showed the audience what it is really like, in society, to have a mental disability of this kind. The use of gray colour with a splash of red when showing the scenes with Max, was very effective, and give the audience the sense of what Max was feeling. I saw this movie with work colleagues who also work with children with this disorder, and we were all curious to see how this disorder would be shown. We were all very pleased. ",=
24,4 February 2010,StrayButlerReturns,9," Sublime film of warmth, humour and power","In this cinematic era of computer animation, the art of claymation (for which hand-moulded figurines are painstakingly photographed one frame at a time) is slowly dissolving. Aardman Studios (the guys behind Wallace and Gromit) seem to be the only ones who still possess the patience required to continue the practise into the 21st Century. It's therefore refreshing to witness the Australian film Mary and Max (the feature film debut of Adam Elliot, who won an Oscar for his short film Harvie Krumpet), which was created using this claymation method to tell a bizarre, sweet and mature story. Tremendously inventive, clever, hilarious and wise, Mary and Max is a sublime movie of warmth and compassion about life's dissonances. The animation is superb, the characters are endearing, the humour is abundant, and it honestly and thoroughly explores several topical themes. If American Beauty director Sam Mendes collaborated with Aardman Animations, the product would be something like Mary and Max.",t

It is pretty rare to connect so deeply with an animated film. The animated aspect can often serve as a barrier that prevents people from deeply identifying with the characters they are witnessing on screen and therefore prevents them from deeply caring for them. With Mary and Max, this couldn't be farther from the truth. This is a film that I think I, and many others, will remember for a long time.",
32,7 February 2010,zetes,7," Sloppy clash of moods, but it's genuinely touching at times and certainly worth a watch","An Australian stop-motion animated film about a dumpy little girl (voiced by Toni Collette) who randomly chooses a name in a New York phone book and writes him a letter. The man on the other side (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is an obese, middle-aged Jew with Asperger's Syndrome. Neither of these people have friends in real life, and they soon become each other's only friends. This is a rather sad story, filmed in a very muted color scheme. The New York sequences, in particular, are almost black and white. The Australian sequences have a lot of brown in them. Writer/director Elliot (claiming he based it on a true story) injects a lot of quirky humor into the picture, almost making it seem like an Aardman product at times. The big difference between this and Aardman: the animators of Mary & Max go out of their way to make everything hideously ugly. There's a big mental disconnect between all of these elements. It wants to be depressing, it wants to be charming, it wants to be hilarious, it wants to be freakish. Fortunately, it does succeed enough of the time where it's well worth watching. At its heart, there's a very touching story. I do not think this deserves to be mentioned alongside the slew of wonderful animated films of the year, except maybe for a footnote.",

It started off like a normal kid friendly stop motion animated movie. It ended up being much, much more. It deals with themes of mental illness, drugs addiction, death, depression and suicide. The movie greatly moved me and by the end I almost cried and not many movies invoke that sort of emotion from me. It isn't perfect by any means, but it is a great film none the less and I recommend you watch it.",

In other words, this is a film that takes animation, claymation in fact, and takes it to another level of possibility. There are a lot of funny things that happen in this story of two pen-pals - one, initially, a 7 year-old Australian girl, and the other a 44 year-old man in New York city - who first connect over a cartoon show and find they have some things very much in common. This is a story that is profound and moving for the depths to which it explores the fragility in human beings, how vulnerable some of us can get, and what being on the 'outside' really means in society, being on the margins as being a woman, or mentally ill, or ""ugly"" whatever that means, or unable to control oneself.",

42,12 July 2015,sharky_55,9, You are my best friend. You are my only friend.,"Mary and Max never lets the viewer settle into a preconceived idea of how the story and characters will act based on the rotund and plump clay figurines who waddle about in the gorgeous and painstakingly detailed world of Adam Elliot's. It's not as smooth as a bigger budgeted animation piece like Wallace & Gromit is but the clay- mation is nevertheless enchanting. The depiction of two worlds apart in New York City and Lamington Drive, Australia consists of hundreds of miniature props and set pieces and even a fully functional tiny typewriter in which Max composes his letters to. The character and set design is whimsical and the film's voice-over, which dictates the majority of the plot points and exposition, is punctuated with absurdities, dark humour and bits of everyday questioning. At surface level, the premise of a middle aged, obese and lonely atheist with Aspergers syndrome being penpals with an equally lonely and bullied eight year girl is simple and easily dissected. The film, unlike many animations, is not bursting with colours or rainbows, instead washed in black and white or a murky brown, with the odd bit of red in the tongues or pom-poms or hair-clips. So that it itself hints at the darker nature of the film. ",

47,10 June 2011,jboothmillard,7, Mary and Max,"There was a small mention of this cartoon film on Film 2009 with Jonathan Ross, obviously it didn't have wide release, but hearing enough about it I was very interested to try it. Basically starting in the 1970's, eight year old Mary (Bethany Whitmore) is the little girl living in Melbourne, Australia with a terrible brown birthmark on her forehead, no friends, a mean alcoholic mother who has kleptomania (the frequent urge to steal) and a love for a children's television show which she makes models of the characters. One day, desperate to find a friend she decides to flick through the phone book and find a random name and write them a letter accompanied with a chocolate bar, and she chooses a guy from New York City. The reader who receives her letter is obese Max Jerry Horovitz (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who has a tragic past, a history of mental illness and lives with the disability Aspergers Syndrome, and feeling lonely himself he is very happy to write back to Mary. So begins a pen pal friendship where they send each other letters about their thoughts, feelings and something (object, food) that represents them-self or where they are living. Years later an older Mary (Toni Collette) still tries to keep in touch with Max, who has become bigger and more depressed over time, she has got married to Damien (Eric Bana) and graduated university, he has won the New York lottery, and that's about it. Max is infuriated when Mary tells him that she is writing a psychological book detailing Aspergers Syndrome, and in anger he removes the M letter from his typewriter, and in response she develops chronic depression. She becomes an alcoholic and attempts suicide by hanging, and her husband Damien leaves her for his own pen pal in New Zealand, but she didn't realise she was pregnant, she is saved by the man who feared going outside, agoraphobic neighbour Len Hislop. Mary receives a forgiveness letter from Max, and with her newborn baby she decides they should meet in person, but when she arrives he is dead, but she cries with happiness seeing all the letters saved on the wall. With wonderful narration from Dame Edna Everage actor Barry Humphries, the voices of Collette, Hoffman and Whitmore really bring the characters to life, the use of colour, black and white for New York and sepia for Australia is really good, and of course the stop motion clay animation is lovable, I can relate to Max living with Apsergers Syndrome myself, and Mary is lovable, it may be dark for children, but a most watchable animated comedy drama. Very good!",

Imagine my surprise when I found a wonderful, funny and deeply touching story, beautifully animated with such great characters. I would even go so far as to say I loved it!

51,2 October 2015,Hitchcoc,10," What a Lovely, Touching Film","I accidentally ordered this film on Netflix. How very serendipitous. This is one of the most creative and touching things I've seen. First of all, the creation of what could have been passed off as grotesques, begin to make their ways into our souls. Both Mary and Max are lost souls who have demons. They are also optimistic, given the hands that have been dealt them. Through circumstances, they have beliefs in the realities of humanity that are so innocent. For example, where to babies come from. Mary has never really had a friend and ends up making contact with Max when she tears his name off the bottom of a telephone book page. They correspond between Australia and New York. They have been bullied and pushed around their whole lives. Max has issues with depression and self esteem. Mary has a mother from hell. Of course, these are clay characters, but when bad things happened to them, I literally wanted to cry. There is no romantic angle, only two people that need each other desperately. Much of it is so funny, but ultimately a serious take on the human condition.",

A film so special and made with so much care and attention that not only is it one of my films of the year it has instantly become one of my favourite films of all time. Its not very often you feel such a strong attachment to characters in a film that spending an hour and half with them just isn't enough, its even stranger when they are not even real. But in that is where the genius of this film shines through, by taking two opposite ends of the spectrum on two opposite sides of the world it shows that space, age, distance and time actually don't make us all that different and problems are problems no matter who or where you are. In the accidental blossoming of their pen pal friendship the two main characters teach each other so much and show us the viewer the powerful nature of the human spirit. Bursting with ideas and an attention to detail that even extends to the colouring you can't fail to fall in love with this movie. In a sea of blockbuster dirge it's amazing to actually see a film this good could make it to the surface, my advice if you see one film this year make it this one, you will not be disappointed.",

Mary a lonely 8 year old in Melbourne decides one day to write ramdomly to a person across the world to find out where babies come from in America. She chooses Max an equally lonely 40 something jew in New York who has aspergers syndrome and many deep routed personal and social issues. An unlikely friendship that spans 20 years through letters evolve between the two. This film is totally charming you laugh you cry you become a part of it.

And I find some of the humor a little too reliant on simply being odd. But hey, I still enjoyed my time with this film and the stop motion was so buttery smooth it looked fake at times.

And lest one can't figure out the film maker's liberal bias in dealing with these subjects, he throws in a slam at former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani by calling the mayor in this story 'Ridiculani'. The 'love yourself' message, which is a good one, sort of gets lost in the hodge-podge of letter writing activity between Mary and Max, and since the correspondence occurred over a span of twenty years, the thought that kept springing into my mind was why neither one of them came up with the idea to visit the other before so much time passed, and then in the end it was too late.

The movie constantly maintains this tone but never leads it to a payoff or a twist; I appreciate the filmmakers' decision to make something so unconventional, but the fact remains that these few original elements cannot support an entire 90-minute movie.

89,17 February 2014,chrichtonsworld,9," A sincere, touching and very beautiful movie that deals with heavy subjects",Mary and max is a clay animated movie intended for adults. For some this will be hard to understand because generally animated features are considered to be made for children. This is something I never quite understood well since this simply is not true. While a majority might be aimed for a younger audience there are quite a few that are meant for youth and adults or adults alone. This is important to realize since Mary and Max is an example of an animated movie that while offering laughs is dealing with very adult themes that can be very confronting. Let me first tell you that Mary and Max is a very funny film through and through. While very unrelentingly confronting you with death and depression it never skips on wit to make you laugh. The narration is brilliant as it helps to distance yourself or get involved when needed. I read somewhere that Barry Humphries' (most famous for his character Dame Edna) was found to be overly used and intrusive. Personally I think it has been key to keep things light instead of depressing. The wit and narration combo in my opinion is a genius way of telling a story filled with heavy subjects that otherwise would be hard to deal with. But next to the darker themes there is one beautiful one that most of the people will be able to appreciate and relate to. Friendship. If you have to remember one thing about a film like this then let it be the fact that here they show the beauty and value of friendship in life no matter how it is conceived and exists. Here the friendship consists of communication through letters. But is just as strong or maybe even stronger than a so called normal one. Here you get to see how much a simple and sincere letter can impact someone's life that proves to be beneficial for both. This film also shows that sometimes people react in unusual ways not because they are mean or evil but simply they view the world differently due to reasons they have no control of and don't know how to respond. I know it's hard and not always possible to have an open mind or be understanding but please do try since it does prove to be worth wile in the long run.,

Two years ago I rented it and found it thoroughly enjoyable apart from being dissatisfied by the ending. Last year I discovered an Internet video review series called 'Jambareeqi Reviews,' which Jambareeqi mentioned on the IMDb message boards. I was intrigued and the first review of his I saw was for this film. Despite his review for this film being somewhat more favourable than mine, I was surprised when he said he had Asperger syndrome himself but reassured as well.

105,23 April 2009,dfle3,7, Grungey odd-couple comedy/drama...but how true is it?,"This is a hard movie to rate. I do remember seeing posters, I think,  which stated that this movie was based on a true story. That wasn't  enough to make me want to watch this movie. So, when the TV show ""At  the movies"" reviewed it, and I saw some funny things, I decided to  watch it.  Watching this claymation movie, I had forgotten about the claims to  truth of this movie, which made me think that this was a very strange  movie indeed. It concerns the titular characters: Mary (voiced by  Bethany Whitmore for the child, and by ""The sixth sense""'s Toni  Collette for the adult), a young Australian girl, and Max, an  American middle-aged man (voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman). Feeling  bored one day, Mary randomly picks a name out of a phone book and  writes to them...which is how she sends Max a letter. The movie airs  the contents of their letters over many years, and displays each  character's psychological state. Barry Humphries provides the narration  in the movie. That element doesn't work particularly well in this  movie, I don't think, as the story-book format can drag at times.  The clip I saw on ""At the movies"" was indicative of the quality of the  film...there are some genuinely funny exchanges between Mary and  Max...laugh out loud funny at times. However, forgetting that this  movie was supposedly based on a true story, I would think that the  content of the movie was very odd. It was quite dark at times. For that  reason, I don't think that this movie is appropriate for pre-teen  children, even though it is made with claymation (plasticine figurines  which are moved and photoed, to create the illusion of life in cinema).  So, as I said, this movie is hard to rate. It is genuinely funny at  times, but sometimes gloomily overwrought, which pegs it back a little.  If this movie bares no relation to reality, then I'd give it 6/10. If  there truth to it, I'd give it a score closer to 7/10. Did read an  interview with the movie's maker, Adam Elliott, in a local suburban  paper where I live (The Monash Leader, 14/04/2009, i.e. ten days ago),  where Elliott admits that the movie is based on his penfriend-ship with  an American when he, Elliott, was a child. On that basis, the high  melodrama that you see in this movie with Mary doesn't really seem to  be based on anything that Elliott himself experienced. On that basis  I'd mark this movie down a bit...it's gloom seems unmotivated. I'll  give it around 65/100.",

107,6 August 2019,RobLuvsTheMountains,3," wonderful animation, but .....","The animation in this film is extremely fun to watch. The animation does a great job of luring the viewer into the film with animation that is funny and informative to the plot thereby making it so the viewer doesn't want to take their eyes off the screen for even a second. The problem with the film is the story. This little girl is being raised by neglectful and abusive parents. Max's Syndrome is severe enough that he should not be living alone unsupervised. Especially since he can become violent. By the time I was done watching this movie I was angry at the movie and it's makers. The animation was so incredibly entertaining and pretty funny, but it is belied by the gravity of what is actually happening. At the end of the movie I felt sick to my stomach. This movie has neglect and abuse, untreated and unabated alcoholism causing death, attempted murder, and attempted suicide. None of the characters get the help they need. I think to call this movie 'oddball' or 'quirky' is misleading. The ANIMATION is oddball and quirky, however, the themes and the plot are not. As an aside, the jab at Giuliani is dishonest and stupid since the mayor in NYC in the mid 70's was Abraham Beame. Giuliani was mayor 1994-2001.",

111,12 March 2014,xodanielcasterox,7," Interesting, dark, witty and depressing.","I wouldn't necessarily regard this as a great movie but for the most part I think it's pretty good. The clay animation is superb--which I swear they're using CG because the stop motion is so damn good--the voice acting is pretty decent although they could have just taken it easy on the narration but it does a little to let the moment sink in when needed but only narrate in the beginning and the end and let the emotions do all the talking. The environment looks depressing and a bit dark but that's a positive for me. I love dark movies. It doesn't push the darkness too far, it has some funny moments to lighten the depressing mood that the characters are going through and has some touching elements that cannot be ignored, in my opinion. This looks like another Tim Burton clay animation but for adults which I was hoping it would be but it's not. I wouldn't recommend this to children but I would say chance it for yourself. Oh, I almost forgot. It has a moral for everyone that we can all learn in life. About choosing the right friends even if there is only one in life, and that person could also be your best friend because he/she is your only friend. It tells you to choose and appreciate the friends you have even if there are few. Thank you for that, movie. Thank you.",

Yes, even more so.

115,28 May 2011,burakcetinler,9, If you want to see some emotional scenes WATCH IT!,Their friendship begins with a random letter and evolves to a close relation. Although it has some depressing scenes everyone can watch it. Because of it's emotional intensity it makes you feel different. The animation that has a pessimist atmosphere but the theme of Friendship can be worked up quite successfully. Sometimeswe can become entangled in contradictions just like Max. Director wanted to mention about this situation. Depressing scenes affected me too much. I was surprised at the animation because it was like real life. Musics between the scenes are really good and on time and well-advised. I noticed that there was little comedy item but it is considerably important for me because when we are extremely sad and in depression we need all of them because they help me. Mary lives in her own world and own designed toys that I really admired. She has desserts and cream and his own life that in loneliness. Max is really interesting man because of chocolate in the bread etc. Our characteristics can be changed and sometimes come to a halt and This situation can cause bad experiences in our lives. It is good to see this examples in animations. LOVE YOURSELF FIRST Mary and Max's common point was it. The thing that strengthen their friendship is that. They accepted themselves with their defects. Nothing is excellent in the life because life is defective. To be happy we must learn how to live with our faults.,
116,11 August 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, Resonant in its own irreverent way.,"Despite an occasionally 'mean spirit', 'Mary And Max (2009)' manages to actually be rather emotionally resonant - in its own, slightly irreverent way, of course. It's generally rough-around-the-edges but ultimately quite endearing, telling the tale of two long-distance best fiends with a heavy dose of 'edgy' humour and some moments of real darkness. It's perhaps because it's not afraid to be as serious as it is, or to present its world as harshly and as blackly comic as it wants to, that it's so successful; it creates a grounded but bleak reality filled downtrodden characters and then takes the time to show the small, yet incredibly powerful, moments of happiness they manage to find within it. The narrative is told mostly through narration - whether by Mary, Max or, well, the narrator - which creates a kind of 'storybook' feel. The lead characters almost never speak to anyone, either, which bolsters their loneliness outside of their all-important written relationship. For the most part, the picture balances its tone well enough. Sometimes, it gets a little too dark or a little too silly for its own good, however. It's aimed primarily at adults, that's for sure. Its pacing isn't quite as tight as you'd like, either. Still, the film is filled with tender, well-conceived moments and usually amounts to an engaging, entertaining time. Like I said, it's quite emotionally resonant, too. 7/10",

118,9 May 2011,rdukeesq,8, great flick,"Mary and Max is a suberbly crafted film released in 2009, and is written and directed by Adam Elliot. To start with this film is Austalian, but takes place in both Australia and New York New York. Next, and most importantly I loved this movie. It was poignant, deeply moving, visually stunning and made you laugh, cry, and think. What more can you ask from a film. This film is somewhat intellectual and takes on some very difficult subjects while having the look of a Wallace and Gromit cartoon. It is beautifully narated by Barry Humphries who is most famous for his Dame Edna character. It also has wonderful supporting voices from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Toni Collette. This is not a mainsteam film and if I find a following, I would hope they maintain a higher standard for their movie watching experience and seek this film out.

120,23 December 2018,iamabossnotreally,10, An Unexpected Masterpiece,"Mary and Max was everything I wanted and more. The story is about a girl named Mary who doesn't have any friends so she sends a letter to a random person in the phone book. The letter is sent to a man in New York. The whole movie is about their relashinship as each other's only friends. This film absolutely drained me emotionally. Their relashinship made me laugh and cry a lot. It really gives off the feel of a real relashinship with all of the ups and downs. In other movies friendships usually don't seem real and are predictable. In this film, their relashinship is anything but predictable. That leads to the rollercoaster of emotions. The best part of this movie though is the writing. Mary's writing perfectly captures the thoughts of a child. Max's writing perfectly captures the thoughts of a man just trying to make a friend. They never tried to go too houmerous with the writing as well. The characters say lines that are funny in context, but because of the excellent voice acting from Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Bethany Witmore, as well as Toni Collete the lines become more humerous because they don't talk like they're making the joke. It just sounds like they're talking like a regular person which makes the joke seem more real and not seem like ""okay, this is where they put the joke."" All the writing seems natural. I've heard complaints about the pacing of this film but I found it great. Nothing was ever too slow or fast. The last thing I want to touch on is the stop motion. It is absolutely stellar. This is some of the best stop motion animation I've ever seen, especially with the very smal budget this film had. There is so much detail in the environments, it's crazy. With all of this in mind, please do yourself a favor and see this film.",

131,14 December 2011,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,10, Mary and Max (2009),"Difficult and mature film making, disguised as an animated film. The childish presentation of the film is important for its subject matter, but it always has a dark and artistic edge. Mary and Max is one of those rarest of films. One that I knew nothing about before seeing it. No trailer, no poster, no plot synopsis etc. All I knew is that it was animated and Hoffman did a voice. The film is a complex look at relationships, family, mental health, sexuality, and acceptance. All these themes pop-up, but are viewed through the eyes of a child, a man with Asperger's, and a woman suffering from depression. The film spans 20 years, and we are treated to the real highs and lows. Whether is be marriage, urinating on a sandwich, or the death of a mime. The film draws you in with its presentation, but keeps you hooked with its thoughts and emotions. Hoffman gives a tremendous performance. The kind that makes you think voice over work should be nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars. Mary and Max treats you to some incredibly funny comedy, and devastatingly saddening tragedy.

The animation was incredible too with splendid smooth movement of the character unlike the clunky and weird stop-motion of Harviee Krumpt, which I do like. The music was nice and catchy too, especially the theme song as well. But if I have to choose my favorite scene, it has to be the ending when Mary found Max dead peacefully in his apartment room and when she saw all the mementos that Max kept from her all the way from childhood such as the pictures and the letters was emotional to watch, I nearly cried there at the ending.

164,6 February 2015,Gray_Balloon_Bob,10, Everything we could ever hope for in a friendship.,"Not everyone can find their voice through writing, find the right rhythm or pace or just the general ideas they want to express. But when someone can write, it's often the purest form of communication. This is a film about people who can write, and write to each other, because it's their consolation and fulfilment. Mary and Max, the titular characters, two disparate figures from separate continents share and understand the world from the beginnings to ends of their pieces of paper, as it's the only way they know how. But it's not a film about writing itself; writing is the beautiful catalyst for the most beautiful friendship, a bond that binds atoms together because these characters will it, and if they will it the universe wills it too.

This movie id severely depressing,,, and i mean it in a positive way.. the way max and mary's characters were etched out,, one colourless,the other multicolored,,although both their worlds were virtually colourless,,, the way their relationship develops over a series of letters,, how it moves with passing time........ this was a result of a very close observation of many different characters and arguably a work of great precision....",

Or, another important question.Do you brave that you say everything which related to your life somebody who you did not meet before by letter? Mary Daisy Dinkle and Max Horovitz met by chance.They did not think to be each other's future. Max was alone and unable to communicate with people around. On the other hand, Mary also alone at home and school. She had an alcoholic mother and insensitive father. In my opinion, that's why Mary prefers to share her own happiness, trouble or secrets with Max. I like animation movies. A new one was added my favorites. The story is told so good that people are not bored and even if you can find the missing aspect, movie remains fully the positive aspect in mind. The part of the movie which impressed me very much is the end. Mary looked at the ceiling and saw all her letter which sends him while sitting next to Max's dead body. Do not need to see her or hear her voice for Max.She was so far away. But still he fell in love with a girl who just saw her picture. That is enough for him. If we think in terms of the Mary, knowing to be loved so much by someone must be very nice. But even though knowing it, as soon as you find that person, to lose.It is very painful. Something which thinks me throughout the whole movie is to share her own secrets somebody who did not meet before. I think, Trusting people who do not recognize should be much easier.

But I started to watch this movie I thought that it is a boring movie because of its title. I thought that it can be about two lovers. But this movie is about pen pal friends. This movie is made more remarkable because of the characters and subject matter it tackles. There are two main characters. One of them is Mary. Mary is an 8 years old living in the suburbs of Melbourne. She randomly chooses a name in a New York phone book and writes him a letter. The man on the other side who is male main character of movie is an obese, middle-aged. Neither of these people have friends in real life, and they soon become each other's only friends. They send letter each other and write what they like and their family. In this way, they begin to learn much more things about their past and why they are being alone. Along their lives, they become pen pals and their unusual friendship pauses due to the anxiety attacks of the unstable Max.Actually, this movie can be an ordinary story and this is a rather sad story, filmed in a very muted color scheme. And It is extremely funny for the most part, but there is also a real sense of gloom around characters. But really ı like this film, especially the end of movie.

The movie is so great that speaks about hard themes like teasing, loneliness, family problems, depression and the autism of Max, a 44 years old man (when the movie begins) that in several situations seems to see the world with the eyes of a child, the same eyes of Mary (especially in the first letters when, for example, they talk about the babies origins).

Love is never simply a recession or just a side to defeat evil, but a comprehensive feeling which includes a peaceful mind and the courage to sacrifice every tiny and selfish emotion.Mary and Max just simply creates the love and compassion naturally, not from the dull speech or some psychological skills, but from the deeply-touched eye of Mary, gazing the ceiling with countless letters. Purity and love is born like a tree without any kind of purposeful sketch.

It is the best animation movie I have ever watched. I frankly say that it is an excellent movie. Actually I do not like watching animation movie but this one is so different. The scenes, the art- design are so live that you can not understand that it is an animation movie or not. In the movie there are two main characters that have same attribution. Mary is an 8 year old girl living in the Melbourne. One day, she chooses a name at random in a phone book and sends off a letter asking about life on the other side of the world. The letter is received by Max, an overweight depressive in his 40's living in New York; he has the sick of Asperger syndrome. And then they started to help each other by letters. Mary is a very lonely and shy girl and her only friend is Max. She asks Max everything about life. And Max learns how to cry, laugh by help of Mary. During the movie it's by equal turns incredibly touching and laughs out loud hilarious. It is a wonderful story which rewards multiple viewings. You laugh at the characters but often feel incredibly sorry for them. I do not like bad ending so I wish the movie would have a happy end. During the film I guessed that Mary and Max would meet one day and would be very happy like a father and a girl. But I was bewildered when Mary got married. I would be happy, if it had got a happy end. And the last scene o film was really sad and tragic. Max hung all the letters from Mary his wall. It is really very romantic. You can fall in love a girl you never see, like Max. The last scene of movie gives the message that there is always pure love. The love of Max is really dramatic.",

231,31 July 2021,sbdqfpv,1, WTF?,This film is neither funny nor interesting. The ending cliche and the plot goes nowhere. How is this rated 8.3?!?!?,
232,26 January 2014,andrewjlorenz,10, The world's best film?,"Although I have never seen ""Shawshank Redemption"", and never will, along with Shine, this would have to be one of the world's best movies ever produced (both by that country known as Australia). The other one I have the highest respect for is ""A Beautiful Mind"".",

235,8 March 2018,quaydobusiness,10, Best movie ever made!,"How do is start to explain to you how strong and powerful this movie could and how relatable it is? how it moved me literally, changed me, taught me new things new, new perspective, you may think i am overreacting but trust i am as close as it gets to being normal when it comes to this matter. the beauty of this movie the stop motion and the details are perfect. The story is rich with emotions, humor and really fun details, it gives you a vibe of life as if they you are living inside that realm. Watch it and you won't regret",
236,25 October 2021,williamcharleson-34530,10," Beautifully dark, honest and endearing","Simply beautiful. The constant pendulum swing between sweet, innocent and comedic to dark and profound is captivating, true to life and endearing. I took great enjoyment watching this and feeling as if I was gifted a brief window into the lives of my closest friends who are Aspeys - for that I am forever thankful. This movie inspired me as a child to take up story telling, a profession I have since pursued to great heights, thank you.",
237,2 January 2019,santa_u,5, A story about an inspiring and deadly relationship,"I liked this movie a lot... till the moment Mary decided it is a good idea to ruin her career, her relationship with husband and even her entire life just because her pen-friend was not happy... Come on, remove Max's face from the cover, remove his name from the book - it would still be a great work on the subject (Asperger's Syndrome)! But no, all the work is destroyed for good. Then even worse - alchoholism and then suicide attempt just because her pen-friend is not writing back? What an unhealthy and toxic relationship is this? What is the message? Kill yourself, if you accidentally hurt your friend, or what? From this point I could not help but hate this friendship of Max and Mary. Too bad, it could be another great, refreshing movie.",
238,15 May 2018,lmandorla,9, A definitely under-rated film,I'm sure why this film was never popular or well-recognized. It's just so good. I accidentally found it and felt like discovering treasure. It's so original. Totally in love with it and wonder why haven't they make more like it.,
239,23 November 2012,mesarvagya,10, A Very Heart Touching Movie,"This movie is one of my best movie. You will see the unlikely friendship formed between a child and an adult man. The story defines many aspects of human behavior. The feelings in the film is so heart touching that one will realize what a true friendship really is. The film gives us idea on Friendship and Love. Max is an obsessed man while Mary is an 8 years old girls with different question in her mind. Both has same nature and wants to be friend-ed by someone. A great movie doesn't need great actors, it needs a heart touching story, which we can see in this movie. A perfect film comprising every emotional feeling of human mind. A perfect story from the perspective of Mary and Max.This is must see movie for anyone who likes to watch adult animation.",
240,4 April 2020,neilweeman,10, An Absolute Gem!,I have a 100 Movies scratch off poster and this was one of the obscure ones the husband found for me for our anniversary. I am going to be recommending it to everyone I see as it was one of the best films I've ever seen!,
241,21 August 2016,GovLaurence,8," Mary and Max, PS a tale of friendship, PPS not a love story...","In the short background ""A tale of friendship between two unlikely pen pals: Mary, a lonely, eight-year-old girl living in the suburbs of Melbourne, and Max, a forty-four-year old, severely obese man living in New York."", you may think something that it's a love story developed by friendship being pen pals over a long years but then when I watched it I found that it represents really more on friendship.",
242,5 November 2016,allanrimban-54205,6, This is NOT for kids (Spoiler),"Because this was a 3D animated movie, I thought it would be nice to show this to my little cousins. I made a BIG mistake. There is one line in the movie that should only be played to mature audiences. And that is: when Max was writing (and saying) how he doesn't know how to wear condoms. ",
