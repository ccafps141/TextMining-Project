0,28 April 2002,Agent10,10, One of those films you have to watch multiple times,"It's hard to judge a film such as this. Its cold and hard, yet can be exhilarating and sarcastic. It can be average, yet it can be visionary. Exploitive? Satirical? Too many questions to consider when one watches this film.",/
1,14 March 2006,Hitchcoc,9, We Are Seeing Our Future,"Having read Anthony Burgess's novel years ago and working my way through the amazingly creative, futuristic dialogue, I really looked forward to seeing the movie. It was not a disappointment. In the hands of Stanley Kubrick, it comes to life. It is the product of the desensitized world that we see unfolding before us in the beginning of the 21st century. There will be a lot of Alexes in the future; there already are. We are slowly moving away from conventional morality and playing with forms of nihilism. Our politics are beginning to diminish the individual rights and safety of our citizens. Our young people are beginning to band together in little covens, the cell phone and the computer creating little worlds where anonymity can lead to diminution of what is good. Pardon my diatribe, but what Alex and his droogs are doing isn't all that out of the ordinary these days. The manipulative, controlling, anything for ""me"" society is just being formed. Kubrick and Burgess had a a vision. Sometimes this movie is called science fiction. The only science fiction thing about it is that it takes place in the future. The violence we see is the violence of those who no longer care what that word means. This whole world is more frightening than the terrorists we see behind every rock. This enemy is us; or the us yet to be.",r
2,26 November 2019,davidmvining,8," A great, but hard watch","I've struggled a bit with this film more than any other Kubrick. The problem is that I think I get it too easily, or I don't get it at all. I'm never quite sure.",e
3,25 February 2004,MovieAddict2016,10, One of Kubrick's best,"To say that the Alex character from Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is unlikable is like saying the Manson family was sort of bad. He's not just unlikable; he's despicable, terrifying, sick, twisted, and ultimately a haunting embodiment of all our greatest realistic fears and worries. But Alex does not see himself as a sick person. The key to this is in his voice-over narrative.",v
4,15 July 2021,kevin_robbins,10, This is an all time masterpiece,"A Clockwork Orange (1971) is a movie I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a little gang of misfits who travels the streets of England causing chaos through their random acts of violence. When they cross each other one night trying to establish a leader the direction of the gang and leader of the gang changes permanently...this movie is directed by legend Stanley Kubrick (The Shining) and stars Malcolm McDowell (Halloween), Patrick Magee (Zulu), Michael Bates (Patton), Warren Clarke (Firefox) and Adrienne Corri (Bunny Lake is Missing). This story from beginning to end is absolutely captivating. The sets are eccentric and unique. The dialogue is brilliant as the terminology is entertaining and well delivered. The acting by McDowell is all time great. One of my favorite all time performances. The circumstances throughout the film are horrifying, hilarious, intense and unpredictable all at the same time. The cinematography within the film keeps your mind turning throughout. This is an all time masterpiece that is an absolute must see and a 10/10.",i
5,6 November 2005,nycritic,10, Kubrick and the Art of Violence.,"Stanley Kubrick has a way of telling stories about violence without actually exploiting them, or going into exaggeration. In DR STRANGELOVE, OR HOW I STOPPED WORRYING AND LEARNED TO LOVE THE BOMB violence as war was discussed, overheard, never truly seen until the final reel when a flurry of atomic bombs exploded into bright mushrooms as the song ""We'll Meet Again"" lovingly played in the background. In 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY Hal-9000 terminates an entire crew in a most chilling way and all we see is a computer screen indicating the termination of life. Now, in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Kubrick actually brings a story about violence, and even then it is art directed within an inch of its life.",e
6,3 January 2005,sol-,10, My brief review of the film,"A disturbing but yet very beautiful piece of film-making, Kubrick has created the ultimate study of mind manipulation in this film. It is a protest against reform programs that take away freedom of a choice, and the message of the film in terms of paying for one's sins in all eternity is inescapable, evident to a large extent in the sardonic nature of the tale. Although set in the future, it hardly feels like it is, this being because the message of the film is overwhelmingly powerful and capable of applying to any age. The film has a number of possible hidden meanings to it  a feat equaled on scale only by Kubrick's former film '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Besides for the meaning behind the film, there are still the marks of a masterpiece. Kubrick's direction is superb alongside the good photography, capturing shadows and angles needed to establish tone. The editing is excellent too, done in a flashy, brainwashing style at times to have relevance to the film. The choice of cast is again inspirational, however the film achieves the most in terms of music. Kubrick manages to use one of the earliest forms of art, classical music, and give it an unforgettable style and importance in the film. It is truly a difficult task to explain what is so great about a film such as 'A Clockwork Orange'  it is maybe best explained by watching the film itself.",w
7,31 January 2017,tyson-hunsaker,8, A controversial and offensive masterpiece.,"Anyone looking to watch A Clockwork Orange might be wanting to revisit some of Stanley Kubrik's work and might be interested in studying this film. Those who have already seen this film tend to already have strong opinions regarding this dark sci-fi movie but for me, I approached this film recently to obtain an opinion for myself and study one of the great masters of cinema. ",/
8,9 January 2022,Ch4ndler_B1ng,10, A second viewing does the trick,"A Clockwork Orange is directed by Stanley Kubrick, my favorite director of all time and this is my second favorite movie of all time including one of my favorite villain performances of all time! A Clockwork Orange is every genre, it's Sci-Fi mixed with crime, drama, psychological thriller, satire, horror elements and most importantly romance (nah, I'm kidding).",r
9,29 November 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, One of the greatest films ever made,"I haven't read the novel that this film is based upon, and I didn't know that much about it before I sat down to see it. I decided to see it after hearing pretty much nothing but praise for the film(in fact, the only negative comments I've ever heard about it is that it deviates too much from the original novel... which is something Kubrick was famous for) and because I immensely enjoyed The Shining and Kubrick's directorial style as seen in it. I must say, it's been quite a while since I saw something so full, spectacular, exhausting and powerful. From the very first frame to the very last... amazing. Kubrick's style is magnificent, his storytelling is among the best ever seen in cinema. With this film he truly captures the raw and pure qualities of violence. I don't think(well, I certainly don't hope) that anyone who ever has or ever will see this film confuses this as an ode or a tribute to violence... this is not, in any way, shape, or form glorifying violence or violent behavior. Quite the contrary, you might say. The film proves, once and for all, that violence spawns violence. Visually, the film is absolutely stunning. The angles, pans, tracking shots... fantastic work. The ideas presented in the film are more than enough to disturb and freak out any normal person... which is(at least part of) the point. If I mention the words 'eyes opened forcefully' you probably already know what I'm talking about, right? That famous sequence has been referenced, spoofed and talked about more times than just about any other visual impression in the history of cinema. The way everyone and everything turns at Alex after he's apparently cured... truly disturbing. I found a surprise at every change in scenery or even in immediate situation, especially in the latter part of the movie. The way society turns against Alex after he rejoins it, apparently a better man... one of the most 'true' and real cinematic truths ever told of humanity. We are beasts, we are what is commonly referred to as 'inhumane'... and Kubrick tells us this in a truly astonishing manner. The plot is very good. It deals with the main character of Alex, beautifully played by Malcolm McDowell, who loves 'a bit of the old ultra-violence'. He is incarcerated and offered a chance to be re-entered to society, after being 'cured' of his psychotic tendencies. The pacing is... well, hard to describe, really... it feels slow, the movie seems to move slowly... but it hardly drags at all. It's exhausting, not to mention hard to sit through, both due to the extreme content and the slowly moving plot, but it's all worth it. The point is pure genius. Pure Kubrick. The acting is flawless... and believe me, that is not a term I use lightly. Every single actor performs perfectly. The characters are perfectly written, credible in every scene and interesting. The cinematography is pure beauty... pure excellence. I've come to love Kubrick's visual style. His cuts of varying speed and intensity, his long takes when dealing with dialog... truly amazing. His use of music is astounding... the use of classical music is great and really adds to the ironic tone and the atmosphere, the mood of the film. This is truly a work of art, and an exhausting but truly worthwhile film. I haven't seen anything quite like it for a while... in fact, maybe I never have. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick or intelligent theater. If you believe yourself to be perceptive and intelligent enough to understand the film on most or all of its levels(I don't claim to, not at all), or even on the most basic levels, such as theme and morale(which is what I understood of it) then you should, nay, then you *need* to see this film. Be prepared, though, it does contain quite a lot of disturbing themes and ideas, and is not in any way for the faint of heart. 10/10",w
10,1 April 2005,FZ-FX,9," Brilliant, stunning and disturbingly entertaining","Few films are as sensational or infamous as Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"". It's impossible to sit through ACO and not have a reaction; whether it be shock, disgust or amazement. The savage tale of a brutal young droog and his subsequent ""reformation"" by the government is as shocking and thought-provoking as ever. ",4
11,1 May 2021,nickenchuggets,10," ""I was cured all right""","It's not an everyday occurrence where you watch a movie that is just so weird and hard to describe to people that haven't watched it that it stands in a category of its own, but that is clockwork orange. This movie was banned for many years and catholics were prohibited from seeing it because of its sexual nature, which literally makes itself known in only the first minute or two. Right from the beginning, when you see Alex, the ""protagonist"" who beats, rapes, and tortures people for his own wicked amusement, staring emotionlessly into the camera, you know you're about to see something that doesn't hold anything back. Clockwork orange is full of acts of violence, sexual imagery, and brutality throughout its various scenes, but that's the whole beauty of it and why this movie still holds up after half a century now. It does what other movies (especially back in the 70s) were afraid to do. The only other one that comes to mind is the exorcist, but that was still 2 years away. Anyway, Alex commands the audience's attention in the first half of this movie, and it's understandable why the people watching would be afraid of him and his sociopathic tendencies. Even his fellow criminals are appalled by his actions, but he makes it very clear to them that he's the leader. That is until the second half of the film where he is arrested and sent to undergo an experimental procedure which is supposed to cure his violent nature and habits. The infamous scene in which his eyes are forced open while watching acts of violence in the theater is something the viewer won't ever forget. Clockwork Orange is another rare example of a movie that, in my view, doesn't have a single dull or disinteresting moment in it, and the film can be easily classified as three parts: the first segment where Alex is still a criminal, the second one where he is sent to prison and ""rehabilitated"", and the last segment when he is released. As said earlier, there will probably never be another movie like this one, and it stands alone in its own category because it is just that unique. There's horror movies, there are comedies, there are thrillers, there's film noir, and then there's clockwork orange.",5

13,12 June 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, Controversial yet very fascinating,"I like and respect Stanley Kubrick, and feel that along with 2001, Dr Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket and Barry Lyndon, A Clockwork Orange is one of his best films. It is probably Kubrick's most controversial film, but it is also one of his most fascinating at the same time. It is the sort of movie that you need to see more than once though, I didn't think much of it first time I love it and appreciate it much more now for what it set out to do.",3

The ban remained until he died.,9
16,26 February 2016,Leofwine_draca,8, Daring and provocative,"This classic controversial film from Stanley Kubrick is a love-it-or-hate-it movie which tends to divide audiences like the rest of the director's filmography. It's certainly a unique movie, perfectly made up to Kubrick's impeccable standards and with important messages for us all. Take for example the core ""corrupt oppressive society"" vibe that runs from 1984 to BRAZIL and you have the basis for A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, which tells of mind control being used on thugs and irredeemably evil prisoners. As well as this, Kubrick's movie looks at violence and its effects on both the purveyors and victims and proves to be a rewarding character study of an angry young man, as played by Malcolm McDowell (CALIGULA) in what can be called one of the defining performances of his career.",4
17,15 April 2018,Theodorum,10, Of course it's perfect!,"A masterpiece of a movie that contains one of the best introduction scenes in movie history and also one of the best ending scenes in movie history.
The satirical content is obvious.
The soundtrack is also a killer... especially the electronic synthetic music parts! Isn't that the darkest piece of music you've ever heard in a dystopian movie?

18,14 April 2020,Analog_Devotee,1, The most overrated film in cinema history.,"I've seen this film three times over the years. The first time I saw it, I was completely blown away by how awful it was. Surely I was missing something, right? I mean, after all, it's considered to be not only one of the best films of the 1970's (no slouching decade) but of all time! I asked a friend of mine who was studying film in California what I was missing, and his answer was, ""Well, it's a Kubrick film, so you may have to watch it more than once."" And so, that following year, I sat down and watched this film two more times waiting for the reveal to finally wash over me. Today, I can tell you that was easily the worst piece of advice I've taken so far in my life. This film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and any ""underlying themes"" people speak of is a load of hogwash. It's just bad. Period.",?

They all think this is a very sick, shocking and just plain revolting movie. Hey, I understand that. When this film was released 35 years ago, it was highly controversial.

25,29 February 2000,ickyptang,10, Kubrick's best,"Stanely Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the first movies that proved that cinema can be the most enlightening and amazing art form around. Movies have always been a true love for me, but it wasn't until this film challenged me that I fell deeply in love.  The first viewing left me speechless, unable to describe how weird and terrible I felt.  I thought it was the film that left me in this mood, so of course that was the easy target to blame.  It was just a bad movie, overrated and stupid and a waste of time.  But upon further thought, I realised the film did exactly what it was supposed to.  It showed how the world can be a weird and horrible place, and how this young man who goes around torturing people and being a wicked person ultimately doesn't have to pay for what he does.  And it's funny too. So this film brilliantly satirises this world, showcasing pure evil and people who ordinarily do not perform such evil are forced to laugh and observe what we all hate to admit is the truth.  It's sick, but at the same time brilliant.  And when one gets down to the core, you can't really explain it.  It just is what it is.  It's real.  No one really sees it very often, but it is out there and everyone knows.  And no one does anything about it.  In essence, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is the ultimate satire, and one of the ultimate film experiences.  It's art, it's life, and in a funky way, it's entertaining.",t
26,14 June 2021,EddyTheMartian007,9, Stanley Kubrick Review #9 - With a rewatch comes much more appreciation and new interpretations!,"A Clockwork Orange was one of the first Kubrick movies I watched without really knowing much about it. At the time I knew I watched something great even if I didn't really see past the main theme, and I couldn't quite describe it. I literally made a list of movies I felt like I could not review or describe if I was forced to because of it, which the next addition to the list was actually 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I digress. The point being, I really appreciated this movie way more on rewatch, my score increased by a full point, from great to amazing! I saw so many more layers to it and potential interpretations for it, some which I will have to focus more on a subsequent rewatch. Hence, this inspired me to make this entire review, which it didn't start as one, I just wanted to give my interpretation, but Kubrick is so great I ended up basically writing a full review, like what happened with my Lolita and Spartacus reviews.",_
27,16 April 2018,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,10, A Clockwork Horror; of cinematic beauty.,"A Clockwork Orange was easily one of the 70s' most controversial movies and easily one of the most disturbed movies of all time; so much so that Kubrick actually withdrew the film from circulation in the UK until he passed away in 1999. That rarely happens to any film, especially to the type of film that the modern world would consider to be an astronomically important cinema-classic.",u
28,2 January 2000,bigdgun,10, The most thought provoking film of all time,"This is just possibly the most ""perfect"" movie ever made. There is no meaningless dialog; not a single extraneous character; and every plot twist is rational and reasonable. Not to mention a superb soundtrack. Because of the intense violence, particularly against women, it is a disturbing and difficult film to sit through. But if you care about the cinema, you must watch without interruption! Characters get what they deserve...in the beginning and at the climax. Let Kubrick take you on the emotional rollercoaster of your cinematic life. And don't forget to breathe.",r

The thought of looking to Steven Spielberg for future answers was almost unbearable as I remembered that his originality often gives way to family fare (The Pinnochio finale of `Artificial Intelligence') in an attempt to pad his already overloaded wallet.  I thought about Sam Mendes and cringed as I remembered that for him art was a floating grocery bag with unclever teenagers clamoring around it in `American Beauty.'

34,8 December 2009,TheUnknown837-1,7," Stanley Kubrick's satire on crime and justice is just shy of being a great movie. It's perverse and provoking, but there's also mad genius beneath its repulsive content","One thing was certain about Stanley Kubrick: once you gave him complete control over the story of his film, you were at the mercy of his malice and onslaught. Like his science-fiction classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", his 1971 film ""A Clockwork Orange"" was and still is a film of heavy controversy and debate. Some laud the movie for its satirical and dark humor when addressing crime and punishment. Others believe it's just too dark, too nihilistic, too right wing, and brutal to be taken for art or even a good movie.",

This is true with a lot of films but for Clockwork Orange, I only had to watch it 2 subsequent times to fall in love with it. There are so many elements of this film that bring it together and make you totally enjoy the story. The music in the film is one such example, at times it's beautiful and at times dark and disturbing, setting the right tone for the scene. Technically this is a sci-fi film because it does take place in the future and there is the plot which involves brainwashing. When many people think of Stanley Kubrick, they think of 2001 and this film. It's because this film stands out as possibly the scariest image of the near future",

The director has chosen to use graphic sex and violence to gloss over a bad script, feeble plot and mediocre acting. This film is remembered today for all of the wrong reasons.

There is a scene in the movie where a woman is bludgeoned with a large ceramic statue of a penis, and at the end, I felt as if I'd been similarly beat.

The main reason being was the character Alex, it freaked me out so much that not only was I supposed to sympathize with a killer by that I could relate to him as a teenager. I had never been so disgusted by a movie at that time. A few years later as an adult I decided to give the movie another chance and I also divided myself from the character Alex trying to look at the film to see if there was anything I was missing since it's such a loved classic. I was completely wrong the first time that I viewed the film, this isn't about Alex, this film is about our society and it's absolutely brilliant. Decades later the film still shocks it's audience and conveys such a powerful message about how we as citizens consider ourselves to be civilized creatures, but when given the opportunity how quickly we could turn. Or how to take a brutal murderer, turn the things he loves most against him and wonder how we could feel for him? A Clockwork Orange is truly a remarkable story and deserves nothing but respect.",

44,4 September 2015,sharky_55,10," What's it going to be, eh?","Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange applies a coat of comic absurdity to the ultra-violence of Alex and his droogs. It is more boisterous than Burgess' novel which masks the explicitness with Nadsat slang, which is much less prevalent in the film. The opening slow dolly away has his gang sprawled out in the Moldova milk bar, a innocent little front for a haven where drugged milk is dispensed out of a bound and chained female sculpture. The ornate mise en scène and the grandiose and imposing electronic Purcell piece create such a chaotic and chilling atmosphere in spite of the setting. Later, the gang ride in the Durango 95, the front two hunched over while the back two sit upright and serenade the wind of the night. Several vehicles swerve almost comically away to avoid a crash and I am reminded of a cartoonish style to the whole approach, green-screen and all. All it needs is some exaggerated sound effects when a car smashes into a wall, as if someone pushed over a whole shelf of percussion instruments in the same way Alex pushes over Mr Alexander's books in his hooliganism. And in that tunnel, the night is young and the lighting is low key and nightmarish, illuminating each savage blow but also distancing us from this dreadful act. Later it's revisited in broad daylight by the subdued Alex, and it's a telling contrast of his persona. ",
45,18 January 2017,filipemanuelneto,1," Brutal, sexual, graphic, horrendous. One of the best movies ever? If it is, I do not want to see the worst.","I never liked this movie. It's based on a book I have not read yet, I've never found it for sale, so I can not judge if it was true to the book. However, most people seem to have a consensual opinion that this movie is brilliant and one of the best ever made. It's a nuisance movie in its very nature, as it tackles too brutal themes. It basically speaks of extreme violence and the possible ways to control it through brainwashing and absolute control over people. It's a world that no one really wants to see. If violence is something we condemn, extreme violence is disgusting. The total conditioning of a person reminds us of the times of slavery and the man as object. These are ideas that our civilization, at great cost, has learned to hate, but we all won with it. These themes would make an excellent movie and this movie would have been great if it did not overdo it all through barbarically graphic and unnecessary scenes! And the film gets worse as it shows to the public plentiful bursting and destruction, accompanied - surprise, or perhaps not - by scenes of nudity and almost explicit sex. Stanley Kubrick filled the vast majority of his films with generous doses of blood and semen. He has always seemed obsessed with all this, and I am sure that Freud would make a rather interesting analysis of that, so why would it be different in his ""magnum opus""? In the midst of all this monument to madness, we must recognize that the film tackles a complex subject and has an interesting history, although it is so abject that it ends up not worth the effort to watch. Perhaps in the future someone with courage will remake this movie in a more restrained manner, without exaggerate. We also emphasized Malcolm McDowell's excellent performance. The actor, still relatively young, went to the limit, accepting things that I, in his shoes, would not accept, and manage to maintained the interpretive level and shine. For this, he deserves congratulations.",

It is a 20 minute idea that takes 2hrs 20 minutes to crawl through the projector initiating the sort of visual atrocity that these days, sadly, Tarantino and Roth get good reviews for. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is and always will be a terrible film; a vicious misuse of character, slyly pathetically trying to present a poncy vandal murderer as some witty ant-hero (yawn) and using classic music and songs as a defiant act of cine vandalism. An absolute no brainer to simply invert dignity and humanity and then bash it all together with stark sets and overalls. It is so unimaginative. And ugly. and did I say BORING.... it just goes on and on .. and even in slow motion! for hours. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE only has a future if remade as A CLOCKWORK CHUCKY and adds Bart Simpson rolling it all into a dumb pop satire of silly-Chucky doll grimace and Simpson's awareness.

55,28 January 2003,cwarne_uk,1, Kubricks' celebration of violence. 0/100.,"It is abundantly clear that Kubrick was a film-maker of genius. This genius was not balanced by anything resembling a moral sense. This film with it's synchonized beatings and hilarious in-out rape scenes are indication of a creator who was so in love with the image that what was actually shown doesn't matter, as long as it looked good. (Think of the whole of ""2001"".) There is a scene in this film where a middle aged woman is raped and beaten to death with the huge phallus she keeps as a work of ""art"". In many ways this is the crucial scene in the film. It is much changed from the book - but only in ways that make us feel that she was just getting her just rewards. Kubrick loads the dice so much that he is at this point more manipulative than Spielberg or Disney would ever dare. Are we supposed to think that a woman ( who quite obviously in the context has no man about the house ) who keeps giant phalli around is just asking for it - YES is quite clearly what Kubrick felt. Why does the film do this. Is it because Kubrick was a violence loving mysoginist. There is no evidence I have to say yes to that. The only answer that I can come up with is that Kubrick just liked the way it looked. That scene though is just typical of a film which dehumanises victims, family and everybody else. The only character allowed the merest semblance of life is Alex - our hero. Even if you appreciate the glorification of the thug, this is still not a good film. Most of it looks like some godforsaken mix of Lindsay Anderson and Ken Russell. The acting is constantly abysmal in that way that only British actors seem able to achieve. To sum up this is pornographic film making posing as a statement about free will. Your still allowed to like it, but be honest with yourself why.",

Both were fascinating movies that had something to say-usually things that stirred the pot. In 1972, his most controversial movie of all was released titled A Clockwork Orange. I absolutely loved this film and I am not ashamed to admit it. I loved the film's take on a bleak, dystopian future reminiscent of a fascist society. I loved the characters in the film despite their ultra-violence. I loved the music and the use of Beethoven and Rossini. Just every little thing about this film can be called a masterpiece. There were people who despised this film because of it use of violence. The kind of violence displayed in the movie was something that was very, very rare in 1972.

Everything is done to the extreme to emphasize the question. You can't just be kind of bad here, you have to be a raving psychotic killer and rapist, no nuance. The simplicity combined with the pacing made the movie quite boring. The question at the center of the movie also didn't fully sing since it is being asked about a psychopath - to me it didn't matter if his motivation for being good is the right one or if his free will has been taken away because his free will should be taken away by the prison system. He shouldn't be allowed back into society. And even what should be the purpose of prison isn't really explored, is it rehabilitation, punishment, or sequestering those unfit to live in society?

The worst thing about it is that you remember certain bits of awfulness for ages and ages afterwards. The movie has nothing (I really mean it). Every thing about the movie is slow. It simply suck. One of the worst pointless movies I have ever seen. I fail to see why this movie seems to be regarded as fresh and groundbreaking. I must be honest and tell that I had a hard time just staying awake, thanks to dull characters and dark photography. The final 20min though do get better with a little suspense but by this time do we really care about what happens in the end? There are no fitting words to aptly describe how truly horrendous this crap was. I saw a commercial advertising this movie--- and that's when the laughter started. Just the commercial alone was enough to make me almost pee my pants laughing. This movie is so empty and vacuous it's hard even to comment. 90% of this film consists of people standing around talking, a lot of it shot outdoors in such darkness that you can't see much of anything. I was recommended this film by a friend who went on to tell me how ""brilliant"" and ""fantastic"" it was. Yeah, right. This is one of the worst adaptations of a book to ever be seen on film. I find it ironic that a film considered by some as 'stylish' is devoid of suspense, or any kind of visual flair... The directorial style seems to be simply point the camera and shoot. If you care one iota about plot, consistent and or logical character motivation, and pacing, avoid this never-ending series of outrageous vignettes masquerading as a movie. The idea of the movie is not bad in fact, but extremely bad acting and just simply horrible realization overcomes any possible good. I was desperate to watch a movie that day ...

67,11 May 2023,Elvis-Del-Valle,9, A brutal masterpiece,"Stanley Kubrick has always been a good director and that's why a lot of his movies are pretty good. This film was another evolutionary step in his style of filmmaking after 2001: A Space Odyssey. It is Malcolm McDowell's great debut in his role as Alex DeLarge which is to date the best of his entire career. Malcolm's performance is sublime and his character is quite believable. Many of the acting are good and the photography is impeccable. It has brutal scenes and striking black humor. It is very well directed and produced. The soundtrack is another of the best things about the film because of Wendy Carlo's electronic score and the use of classical music pieces. The soundtrack fits very well with the rhythm of the film. It's supposed to be a sci-fi movie, though it doesn't feel quite futuristic in some ways. The script is well developed, but as always happens with adaptations of literary works, there are noticeable differences. Most of the changes are understandable, since the movie summarizes the original novel leaving out some things and there are changes that don't affect the plot. One of those changes is Alex's age because in the novel he is a minor and also in the novel, the young victims of rape are girls. Of course, replicating this in the film was not going to be entirely possible and that is why it had to be modified. Even so, the film respects the novel quite a bit. His only sin was to omit the final chapter that was not included in the novel after it was published in America. That caused the book's author Anthony Burgess to have a low opinion of the film, as he thought it was a misinterpretation of the novel. That suspicion grew even more after the film ended, inspired by some crimes that occurred in England after its release. Sadly, that made Anthony regret writing the novel and ended up hating it. Although the film omits the final chapter of the novel because it hasn't been published, it does in part cause the film to end with a moral opposite to the novel's original moral. This is where the clash between the novel and the film is born. The novel is an excellent book and the movie is a masterpiece. Both deserve the same recognition. Despite the controversies, that will never change the fact that A Clockwork Orange is a very good work. The novel deserves to be read by lovers of literature and the movie deserves to be seen by movie lovers. My final rating for this movie is 9/10.",

Some (I among them) salivate over Kubrick's complete mastery of the film medium while others want to burn the film as morally dubious at best and repugnant at worst. The criticisms I hear most often leveled at the film concern the fact that Kubrick has us sympathizing with a young punk whose favorite pastime is violence (any kind, including beatings, rapes, bludgeonings and stabbings). I do agree that we sympathize with Alex, the film's main character, but I disagree that this is to the film's detriment. The movie, like the book on which it is based, is told essentially in first person. Alex narrates the film, and we never see an event occur that Alex himself is not present to witness.

But whichever way one chooses to approach the film, one thing is certain: it is without doubt one of the most uncompromisingly challenging examinations of the many faces of violence ever made. Where lies the attraction of violence, what are the consequences of violence, is there a solution to violence? It would be easy to expect a glib and sentimental answer to such questions, perhaps some comfortable conclusion that even the most evil of individuals is good at heart.

I think the reason why it is so popular is that it questions life, and it focuses on taboo topics. There's the element of ""shock value"" and the fact that no one else would have dared to make a film like this.",

It's repugnant and I didn't have a lot of sympathy for him; he's apparently the worst kind of person, completely uncaring about the feelings of others, with little in his background that seems to push him into this. If anything, he's the one who's pushing. He likes Beethoven, indicating he's relatively smart and should know better. A Clockwork Orange is set in the future (when exactly, I don't know- it may be the present day by now). Is this really where the makers of the show thought we were headed?

The riding in the car scene was so fake I wouldn't blame anyone for shutting the movie off right there. I really can't understand how this man is regarded as a movie making genius. He trivializes serious subject matter and glorifies the worst elements of society. This movie shows him at his absolute worst and lowest. From start to finish, his vision goes absolutely nowhere except from outlandishly hideous scene to the next. Nobody could act worth a lick in this, especially the old man whose home he ends up at for the second time and his mother. The scene with her sobbing after his release was almost too much. The meeting with Alex and his councelor was equally hard to endure. The nudity was tasteless and without any purpose other than to maybe shock and titilate little boys. From the Milk Bar to the ""Treatment"" to the finale, we are given nothing but overacted schlock that annoyed rather than entertained. I really did ennoy the novel, and Kurbrick should have not have been allowed within a 500 mile radius of it. Silly trite nonsense. Insulting, frankly. Malcolm McDowell was simply awful in this. He was only mildly more horrendous in Caligula, which at least didn't pretend to be anything more than a soft porn light hearted romp. Bad framing. Bad lighting. Bad editing. At least the dialogue was mildly interesting due to the language invented by the author of the book, so no credit can be thrown Kubrick's way for that. Geez man why would he thing anybody would want to see Alex chewing his food like a disgusting hog? Mindless all the way through on every level.

The whole thing seems to be designed to appeal to base instincts through violence and sex without ever making any valid or thought provoking points about either these or any other issue. I realise it is in the top 250 list but personally I feel this film owes more to its notoriety (people thinking it was banned despite the fact it was actually willingly withdrawn by Kubrick in certain countries) than to any real merit in the film.

108,21 September 2021,NoodleFromWithin,9," Thought-provoking, with a sharp and dark sense of humor...","The first thing that struck me, after watching this movie a couple of days ago, is how thoroughly modern it still looks. Unlike many of its contemporaries, A Clockwork Orange can't be considered as ""dated"", and all those issues it addresses are as urgent today as they were five decades ago. How many other movies - from the early '70s - can actually make such a statement? Beware, this movie is not an easy one to digest, to absorb, to analyse, we can't be able to fully understand the genius behind it. I believe the film maker wants to target the ineffective and inhumane methods, too often contrived by our governments, to suppress the criminal behavior, asking what kind of sacrifices we are willing to make to live in relative security, regardless of the cost. Another important factor, highlighted in the plot, is the trickiness about wondering whether the removal of free will can destroy an individual's essential humanity. Then, there's the soundtrack - the music here keeps the viewers glued to the screen, with an alienating sense of anxiety perpetrated by a masterful mix of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, The William Tell Overture an Singin' in the Rain - is there anything else I need to add? Oh yes, those eyes - Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his eyes are a perfect fit with the purpose of the whole movie. A dark and gloomy atmosphere, a dystopian scenario, a storyline deeply disturbing and provocative, a gritty and terrifying background, with several scenes of unprecedented violence: all of this collected inside a masterpiece, signed by Stanley Kubrick. An epic movie, bound to be watched by generations and generations in the future, whilst still carrying the same message.

Looking back, it's probably the year that I was introduced to the most great literary works of all my life (especially 'Anthem' by Ayn Rand and 'Nausea' by Jean-Paul Sartre). Included that year in the course's curriculum was Anthony Burgess' dystopian masterwork, 'A Clockwork Orange' (as well as George Orwell's 'Animal Farm'--like Frank Sinatra would have said, 'It was a very good year'). I was mesmerized with it from the instant I noticed the unique approach to language, the 'ultraviolence' and of course, the eternal question of free will, its relationship to good-and-evil, and the can of worms of the myriad of ethical dilemmas that comes to the fore of individual freedom and rights versus that of society at large. The genius of Burgess was being able to put so well and forcibly, yet in such an entertaining way, so many issues that, had most anyone else set forth on the endeavor, would have come up with the type of off-putting, heavy-handed sermon that would never have reached such a literary pinnacle, and been required reading even now, generations later.

He may have been bound into the futuristic sixties-mod style, but it does not fit the book or subject matter.  The movie drags on and on and on at a snails pace, completely against the flow of action in the book.  And then there's Kubrick's own personal perversion.  He, if you've seen moer of his work, loves nudes.  everywhere you look in this movie there's nude paintings, and statues, and various impressionistic nudes and classical nudes and marble nude statues which pour drugged milk from the nipples.  though i am not opposed to nudity in various forms, it completely destroyed the purpose and mood and theme and everything that was good about the book.  and it was all so clean!  anyway, the movie hit rock bottom for me when instead of accidently killing an old woman with a small statue(like in the book), he crushed her head with a giant ceramic penis.

Words cannot begin to express how much I hate this movie. From the terrible zoom lens shots to the shoddy production design and bad photography. The script misses key elements from the book. Characters disappear without a trace and one of the defining scenes where Alex plies some old ladies with alcohol in exchange for an alibi is inexplicably absent from the movie. It is mysoginistic trash. The book describes the sexy costume the girl wears who is to be a temptation to Alex after his conditioning and Kubrick uses the opportunity to show yet another pair of bare breasts. A scene where a young girl has been kidnapped by a gang is replaced with an unnecessary rape scene. Every woman is a victim in this movie. This is definately one for women haters.

It is a futuristic movie with Alex having the lead role, a gang-leader whose main interests are violence, rape and Beethoven.
The cinematography is brilliant, the acting superb, and the background score very much satisfying. The symmetrical and one-point perspective shots of Stanley Kubrick are on a whole new level. His photography and direction techniques are beyond comparison. The energetic Malcolm McDowell brings the character of Alex to life. At times, you hate him, at times you love him. At some point, you also feel pity for him. Malcolm's sophisticated and polite, and sometimes amusing manner is very much noticed and appreciated. The character development of Alex is very exciting and is also what makes this movie a success. The language which is used in this movie is called 'Nadsat'. It is difficult to understand this language (invented by Anthony Burgess) easily but that's what makes the movie more attractive.

It asks viewers to let down their accusations until the flip side is revealed. It introduces Alex and his three druids on a typical night of beatings, gang wars and rape before relaxing with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Betrayed by his druids after a burglary turned murder, he is sentenced to fourteen years in prison until chosen for an experiment to cure sin. Controversial and extremely disturbing but not without rhyme or reason. It will either offend the squeamish or insight the intellect.

Malcolm McDowell delivers a poetic performance as Alex with strong supporting work by Patric Magee as Mr. Alexander, a writer victimized and will seek revenge after his wife's death. She is played by Adrienne Corri whose humiliating vulnerability made her a great trooper during filming. Anthony Sharp plays a political figure and founder of the cure.

I did not know it then, but they were mimicking the 'Droogs' - the gang from Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' ( 1971 ). Like Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs' ( 1971 ) and Hooper's 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' ( 1974 ), a mystique built up around the film because it was impossible to see for many years. When it finally became commercially available - after the director's death - a minority grumbled it was 'overrated'. Not so. 'A Clockwork Orange' is marvellous. Based on Anthony Burgess' provocative and thought-provoking novel, it is about a gang with no respect for authority led by 'Alex DeLarge' ( Malcolm McDowall ) whose hobbies are rape, ultra-violence and Beethoven. They even have their own language. A good night out to them involves at some point the beating-up of an old tramp. In one of the most shocking scenes ever put on film, they break into the home of writer Mr.Alexander ( Patrick Magee ) and rape his wife ( Adrienne Corri ) in front of him while warbling 'Singing In The Rain'. Eventually, Alex is caught, jailed, and subjected to a new kind of aversion therapy. No longer capable of violent acts, he is released. But some of his victims have not forgotten nor forgiven him, and set about exacting revenge...",

139,29 June 2007,blanbrn,10, Raw and wicked. Stanley Kubrick's take on the mind and macabre.,"""A Clockwork Orange"" is clearly a film of delight, pleasure, and just flat out raw drama and horror. The scenes and images during the film are highly remembered and stunning especially the colorful displays in houses and the sculptured mannequins in the milk bar at the films start. Also flashing images of nude women and even Christ are hard to leave one's mind after watching the film. The story is a great take on character study of the mind and how it can change. You have Alex(Malcolm McDowell) a thug and modern day hooligan who along with his friends enjoy having fun at the expense and tragedy of others. You name it Alex and his sidekicks roam modern day Britian in search of terror, from violence to the attacks and rapes of women. A viewer will find many scenes of this film disturbing . Until one day Alex's little playhouse comes crashing down when caught he's sent to prison. Upon arrival he begins the journey of reform it's only when a new experiment of a mind and ego transplant takes place that really changes him and it makes this film a different story from the second half on. Alex then upon release finds himself a different person now a proper citizen after being brainwashed it's crazy to see him encounter his family, friends, and many victims after his release it's just not the same as the guilt, remorse, and sorrow drive him to be crazy and again a need to be dark. Really I just love the way that Kubrick showed how one's mind can change and that people can take on new and different personalities and behavior, and yes I believe anything is possible by mind manipulation and tinkering. Really a film that shows two sides of a central character like Alex the good and the bad proving that the mind and one's own free will and choice either makes or breaks you. To sum it up ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the best films made because of the images, and the music theme is creepy and spooky it really tingles your skin, Stanley Kubrick as always pushes the limits by showing another side to humanity and life proving that having fun and a good feeling can both be great. A final say this classic proved still that much is still to be discovered in terms of the mind and of the future, clearly an unforgettable picture.",

The scene where his crew sexually assault a woman did not have to that detailed. It takes a good director to be able to get his/her point across without showing everything. For example, how could Charlie Chaplin's the Tramp get his points across without using a single word? Kubrick wanted to make it graphic to help emphasize his point, but he didn't think or care how it might effect actual victims of similar crimes. Those who think I'm being prudish have never been a victim or known one personally. The rest of the film is not near as clear as the way it is described, in fact it just meanders along with no real sense of direction at all, and ends with you scratching your head thinking, ""Is the best he could do?""

The gang rape scene alone is still scary (I had nightmares about it after first seeing the movie), even if you never see any penetration. It's isn't scary because it's graphic-- it's the gleeful, unwarranted cruelty of Alex Delarge which is unnerving, how the thought of tormenting innocents is enough to send him singing and dancing in-between kicks to an old man's chest.

160,29 June 2017,avik-basu1889,10, Kubrick lays down the morality trap !!!,"'A Clockwork Orange' is violent, it's brutal, but what it's not is a film that glorifies its violence as many critics and audiences believe it does. Every scene of violence, however ugly it may be, serves a purpose thematically. The violence is often accompanied by playful classical/modern music. I think the music and playful tone of the scenes directly express the allure that violence holds in the minds of youngsters like Alex. An important aspect to be noted in the violent scenes is the lack of blood or the lack of shots showing the after-effects of violence. It's just unreasonable violence. But the lack of logic behind the committing of these violent acts and the playful tone of the scenes will make the viewer question why violence is so alluring to Alex and his 'droogs'. Why does he get stimulated by the prospect of harming others? Is Alex a bad seed, is he naturally 'evil'? Now although this question is not directly answered, there are hints and imagery littered throughout the film that suggest otherwise. In the movie, Kubrick depicts a society around Alex that cannot completely wash its hands off the crimes of Alex and claim absolution from the guilt of giving rise to boys like him. Kubrick implicitly hints towards the existence of elements like parental neglect and abuse, the insidious hypocrisy of authority figures like Mr.Deltoid, governmental impotence in dealing with and thereby curbing vandalism and criminal activity, systemic fascism and an overall societal apathy leading to perennial decadence. These elements underline the notion that Alex in spite of his demonic actions and tendencies might not be naturally evil and he might not be the sole person to blame. Alex is a product of the society that he lives in and of course a product of the government that 'protects' him.",

A lot of the genius to this movie is in the way the violence is handled. Innocent people get beaten up all the time, and Kubrick manages to make it look really beautiful. The classical music is a great touch as well. I watch Kubrick movies mainly for the stories that are always well-developed and the cinematography, but the actors steal this movie.

It was terrible acting from the hobo and terrible dialogue, or should I say, terrible preaching. This scene, as ineffective as it may be, sets the tone and basic underlying theme of the rest of the film. The government has lost control. The gang then proceeds to beat the hobo with chains and canes. This is not the end of a night out on the town. The droogs talk their way into a house and the woman opens the door. The gang quickly rushes in and bounds the husband and wife. Alex then rapes the wife as he sings ""Singin in the Rain."" The helpless husband watches in horror. The act is funny in which it's presented in satire form. The singing done by Alex during his rape almost diverts the attention of what's really happening. The goofiness of the gang and the way they talk, walk, and act becomes more funny than horrifying.

Cannily-made apocalypse-comedy from writer-director Stanley Kubrick, who is often very sly regarding his position on this material (he's a tricky filmmaker who doesn't at all mind changing the rules on his audience, playing them for a fool in the process). Kubrick, who is as much the star here as leading actor Malcolm McDowell, is alternately decadent, dazzling, pretentious and juvenile (some of his technical gimmicks and sexual jabs aren't as pointed as they're meant to be). The film doesn't attempt to solve the sometimes confounding cinematic connection between (and the curious lure of) violence and sex--and I'm not a big fan of the queasy mixed with the satirically sensational--yet after a few reels of this stuff, you're ready for Kubrick to change gears (and, in the third act, he does). Adapted from the cult book by Anthony Burgess, Kubrick lets the meaning of the story's title slip away within this medium--yet nothing is carelessly done, out of reach or out of bounds for Kubrick.

The sets may have been futuristic at the time, but just look dated now; the constant camera angle looking down at the menacing face, becomes tiresome very quickly.

He has produced so many masterpieces, and so many of his films are seen as magnum opuses of their respective genres. It's also hard to pick his best film as I like most of his films more as I continue to re-watch them. I put off watching ""A Clockwork Orange"" for quite a long time. I knew about the violent/sexually explicit content in it. I wanted to make sure that I was desensitized before watching it. I didn't want to miss out on something spectacular due to it being too much for me to handle. When I did watch it, however, it only took 5 minutes for me to get engaged into the film.",

The only message this story has is that it's great to be a criminal, there is no justice in the world and that's acceptable for humankind. For those of you who say its just art, I call bulls**t. I love art. I know the difference between great art and one sick mans indulgence. This is more of a look into the minds of others and it's creators. And it is very unsettling.

It seemed to deserve its place in the first 50 in the IMDb rating... Then I watched the film. And I believe it is one of the most disgusting films I ever saw.

Because, you see, without it the viewer won't understand. He won't understand the idea of mixing English with misused and twisted Russian words. He won't understand that the Music line is supposed to be thought-provoking and not just stupid: ah, Beethoven and the Nazi, Beauty and the Beast, whatever.

It says: As ugly and brutish as life is, we as human beings manage to make it much, much worse. It's a satire that suggests ignorance & institutional arrogance is in fact, more grotesque than overt debauchery. Not a feelgood film. Quite the opposite.

195,22 February 2003,Mort-31,10, A lot of Burgess,"A Clockwork Orange is probably the most merciless story about society, the most convincing of critical statements ever made. We awe it first to Anthony Burgess, then to Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick, while treating Burgess's text respectfully, made the very best out of the wonderful plot. He managed to bring it across visually with almost more wit and creativity than any reader of the book can imagine for himself. He crowds his stylish futuristic world with an excellent leading actor and with an uncountable number of (stereo)types that are so funny and so funnily played that the movie is not depressing despite its disturbing topic. When during the end credits the song `Singin' in the Rain' rings out, I will sing along jollily, despite what the song stands for in the movie. Generally, the music, virtuously conducted, is an important element in the film and  again  a brilliant one. And the production design! The Korova Milkbar alone is a masterpiece.",

197,10 February 2004,scharnbergmax-se,1, The Most Unethical Movie Produced Since the Second World War,"Almost all commentators have for two generations bestowed unmixed praise on this movie. I do not deny its technical merits. But it is impossible to arrive at a fair evaluation, without taking into account the secret propagandistic aim. The film was intended as a weapon in a protracted and still unfinished war within psychology and psychiatry. One of the fighting sides consists of psychodynamic therapists, or for short, psychotherapist. Their procedures are to a greater or lesser extent based on psychoanalysis. The other side consists of the behaviour therapists, whose approach is based on learning theory. During 40 years I have encountered no more than two persons who have pointed out the flaws of A Clockwork Orange'. One was the late Professor Hans-Jürgen Eysenck at London University. I myself am the other one. I discussed the movie in my doctoral thesis in 1984, and once more in The Non-Authentic Nature of Freud's Observations' (2 vol., 1993). The latter is acknowledged as one of the most important writings within the trend of modern Freud criticism, which started in the 1990s. If we want to grasp the real nature of the movie, we cannot avoid a careful scrutiny of the context in which the movie is embedded. We must direct our attention toward many facts which at the first glance seem to have no relation to the movie. I ask the reader to be patient; in due course I shall justify my `digression'. - - - Psychoanalysis was created by Sigmund Freud around 1895. Freud boasted that psychoanalytic treatment will not merely cure some, but each and every neurotic patients. In addition, it will provide a life-time guarantee against relapse. (Anyone doubting that Freud said such foolish lies may take a look at Gesammelte Werke, vol. XI, pp. 467-469.) One of his further (and equally mendacious) claims is that he and his followers have gathered a wealth of highly surprising clinical observations, which provide foolproof evidence of the theory. For almost a century Freud's followers repeated these claims. Not until the last ten years have they been forced to admit the truth, viz. that treatment has no therapeutic effect; that all non-trivial observations were faked; and that many of Freud's alleged patients did not even exist. - - - It may be debated whether behaviour therapy started in 1924 or 1904. But there is scientific proof that the treatment is highly efficacious. And while the normal duration of psychotherapy is measured in years, the duration of behaviour therapy is measured in weeks. Psychotherapists rightly perceived it as a dangerous rival. For many decades they succeeded in keeping it away from psychic clinics. However, thanks to Professor Eysenck the existence of behaviour therapy could no longer be concealed after 1960. The result was an immense reduction of patients seeking psychotherapy. The members of this profession suffered great economic problems. Their first counter attack was to start a world-wide campaign against behaviour therapy. There are specific reasons why it was easy to start such a campaign. It had always been the goal of psychotherapists to convert their patient into a true believer of psychoanalysis. And they had usually succeeded with this goal, even if the patients had not been cured. Many former patients held influential key positions: university teachers, reporters, writers of fiction, movie directors. Newspapers disseminated the lie that behaviour therapists treat bed-wetting children with electric shocks. Quite a few of my own university teachers asserted that behaviour therapists aim at transforming their patients into automatons without emotions. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE' IS PART OF THIS HIGHLY UNETHICAL CAMPAIGN. THE AIM IS TO DISSUADE SICK PEOPLE FROM TURNING TO THE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY FOR HELP. INSTEAD, THEY SHOULD GO TO PSYCHOTHERAPISTS, THEREBY SAVING THEM FROM ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. - - - Now look at Kubrick's movie, but not with eyes wide shut. A key theme is that the government has decided to apply behaviour therapy to criminals. What motive is attributed to the government? Is the aim to reduce the rate of relapse among convicts and, hence, to reduce the number of future victims of crimes? Oh no! Is humanitarian concern involved as regards a young boy who is serving a 14-year prison sentence? Oh no! If we may believe Mr. Kubrick, the government consists of scoundrels who needs the prisons for detaining their political opponents. Therefore it is imperative to empty the prisons rapidly of ordinary criminals. For this purpose behaviour therapy comes as a godsend gift. - The evil-minded parody of the outcome of the treatment depicted in the movie, is not even possible in homo sapiens. The boy invariably starts with strong aggressive feelings and with preparation for a violent action. Only as a second step is he overwhelmed by nausea. - There are many other things Kubrick and his writer would prefer the spectator not to notice. First, the troubles the boy experienced after release from the prison, are not in the least a result of the treatment. These troubles would not have occurred, if mass media had not given widespread publicity to his case and, without any respect of anonymity, informed the whole country that from now on it is safe to perform aggressive acts against this boy. Second, prior to the conviction the boy used to beat up peoples just for fun, with minor consequences for himself until a woman was killed for fun'. After he was released, each of his former victims was satisfied with performing one single act of retaliation. It would not take many days before he was through with all the retaliatory acts. And afterwards he had no reason to fear further violence. Third, who would sincerely claim that keeping the boy in prison for 14 years would be a more humane treatment? - Two final questions to the reader: Do you think that the description of the war within psychology is a superfluous digression? Do you think that users, reviewers and experts should not bother about the Kubrick's evil-minded aim, when they evaluate the movie?",

199,9 October 1999,macpherr,6, This is a very interesting movie.,"Malcolm McDowell (Mr. Magoo) ""Alex DeLarge"" the young man,  supposed to be fifteen years old,  according to the book, speaking Nadsat as slang (Russified  English) is the key character in the movie.  He is the leader of a gang of four juvenile delinquents.  It appears that they are extremely bored. They committed heinous crimes.  He went to prison and decided to go though ""aversion therapy,"" in order to get released earlier,  and after the therapy he  becomes excessively passive.  After being used by an anti-government group which caused him to try to commit suicide, and much criticism in the press he is restored back to what he was. Watching both processes is very interesting. The first time I watched this movie, is somewhat historical in our household.  My husband and I were vacationing abroad and we found ourselves with nothing to do on Saturday night than to go to a movie. My husband had already watched A Clockwork Orange.   Well, the censors in the country that will remain   nameless decided to add little black balls to covering the genitals and breasts of the naked women in the movie. Those little black balls kept jumping up and down during the ""Billy Boy"" scene. The entire theater was laughing and we all got severely distracted.

Rampant youths stealing cars, breaking into homes, daubing walls with grafitti, overdosing on drugs, bashing the elderly, involving themselves in murder, rape and terrorism.  What a prophetic film!

212,16 June 2016,imbluzclooby,7, The work of an Evil Genius,"If you watch this to gain extra depth from your discerning mind and senses, the more disturbing it becomes. Even though the violence is stylized, comical, choreographed and phony, the movie's theme is more repugnant than most Avant Gaurde and Noir film makers could even fathom making. This film, although groundbreaking in its shameless and willful ambition, has some flaws. The flaws are artistic choices that are meant to convey an idea while a few other flaws are just poor craftsmanship. The acting is quite uneven in some areas. The set designs, background settings along with inappropriate wide angle camera shots, for me, detract from the personal focal points required for me to get personally involved and connected. Most everything in Clockwork Orange looks too post 60's modern from the home decors, artwork, and some other set designs. It is highly unlikely that middle aged people will sport funky futuristic furniture and art in their home, especially in England. What's more off-putting was some of the dialogue and kitschy usage of British youth slang. And I think this turned off many viewers as well. I am convinced that Stanley Kubrick was a genuinely evil man. Whether or not one agrees with this charge is not important to me, but after I begin to make a compelling argument against this film from a moral standpoint, you may consider it. To begin, our protagonist and (Humble Narrator)is a sadistic villain, who, without any rationale or excuse, commits heinous crimes without giving any personal reasons for doing so. As we follow Alex and his gang of Droogs on this voyeuristic rampage we witness their assaults on innocent victims, both young and old. There aren't any social or anarchist purposes for doing so. They do it just for kicks. This fuels their rebellious spirit, and somehow we are supposed to admire them.",

This film is so well done, you don't even realize what you have felt until it is over.  Brilliantly, Kubrick pulls you right through this movie, controlling your emotions with the onscreen action. Example, at the begining of the film, you witness the horrific acts of violence and rape, so when he is caught, you don't fell bad for him whatsoever.  Through prison and treatment he is ""cured"", and in the demonstration he is beaten to show he will not fight back.  When he is released, he is disowned by his parents, insulted by the guy who lives in his room, beaten by homeless guys, and nearly drowned by his former droggies.  At that point in the movie, I said to myself ""he doesn't deserve this, he did his time, he can't even defend himself"", it was at that point that I realized how talented Kubrick really was.

This goes for the infamous A Clockwork Orange, famously known for being one of the most controversial films of all-time. I would say it lives up to its title, especially when you look at it from the perspective of a viewer in '71. A Clockwork Orange still holds up today as being a frighteningly disturbing portrait of a ruthless mind. Though not quite as graphic as one might expect, the film holds no bars on its disturbingly genuine nature and shocking content, though all of this is a primary factor of the film's moral. A Clockwork Orange is neither exploitive, nor degrading because all the content is in equilibrium with the importance and startling impact of the film.",

I have since tried on a number of occasions to watch it all and have only managed to watch it in its entirety twice. I have come to the conclusion that this film is just not for me. I always try to find something positive in any film I watch but I could not find anything in this film to admire. The whole experience was in the absence of a more appropriate word, boring. I have no doubt that the cast and crew were well intentioned and believed they had done a reasonable job at the time but in my opinion the film is 136 minutes of self indulgent rubbish and it appears today to be very dated. I might have reacted differently if I had watched it at the time of its release but somehow I doubt it. I know I am in the minority who just don't like this film but that has never bothered me. There are a handful of films which I have seen which fall into my own category of 'a waste of time and money' and this is one of them.

If he wants a cathartic experience to relieve the stress of the world he just beats someone up. He has no regard for how his actions impact others. We as viewers fight with ourselves to not empathize with Alex because we have wants and needs that go unfulfilled everyday. Although we are civilized and generally safe in society, sometimes I wish I could have sex whenever I felt like it with whoever I want with no strings attached, or steal the car of my dreams without having to work for it, or beat the crap out of government officials to make myself feel better. So now we weigh what is worth more,the regard for human kind or my gratification. It is this pulling of what is right and wrong that the film employs so well.

264,7 February 2002,AdFin,10," ""As I slooshied, I knew such lovely pictures""","It's got to be handed to Kubrick; no other director can be cited as making so many back-to-back classics in his working career.  His ability to move seamlessly from genre to genre, still covering the themes of man's metamorphosis, his place in the universe and his desire to choose between right and wrong, is something some filmmakers never manage.  If his previous film 2001: A Space Odyssey was his attempt to look at man's place in existence, the surely A Clockwork Orange is a look at man's place in society, not in any Ken Loach, lower class, upper class rivalry way, but in how man functions in society.  The question raised by Kubrick and writer Anthony Burgess is `if man cannot freely choose between right or wrong does he cease to be a man?'  Kubrick and Burgess seem to be in agreement, yes! But whereas Burgess' novel showed us that, given time, the person will soon grow-up and decide for themselves, once and for all, what path to choose in life.  But because Kubrick missed the last chapter of the book, the film takes on an entirely different agenda. ",

It's too much for me, and I've seen Requiem for a Dream twice. I could probably never sit through Irreversible, not that I ever wanted to. Sex in film depends with each film.

266,21 July 2004,blank_tyler87,5, Disappointing at best,"Before I am harshly attacked verbally for this review, let me begin by stating that I think Kubrick has done some brilliant work. I absolutely loved ""Space Oddyssey"", ""Lolita"", and ""The Shining"", but something about this one didn't sit right. The plot sounds like an interesting idea: the leader of a terrible violent gang is arrested and forced to partake in a new form of criminal therapy. The end result is that he becomes ill at the very thought of a violent or sexual action, and as a side-effect suffers the same effect upon hearing Beethoven's music. So why would such an excellent and creative idea turn up such bad results? The ""ultra-violence"" is indeed disturbing, but to be honest I couldn't care less about any of these characters. Malcolm MacDowell does a mediocre job playing the main character and hence I found it hard to even care about the story. I found the movie shocking and disturbing, but not good. Disturbing and graphic movies I've enjoyed before such as ""Se7en"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"" managed to create characters I was interested in and could care about. However the below-average performance of Alex completely negated any and all chances of enjoying this film. If I didn't feel the need to sit through it all and not form a full opinion until the end, I would've turned the film off before falling asleep from complete boredom with the characters.",

Bearing that in mind, I have say, that it was the greatest load of tripe I have ever experienced. The movie was irrational,illogical and nonsensical. It was a celebration of anarchy and of humanism. In Burgess/Kubrick's opinion,to think outside the normal boundaries and restrains that have been placed upon us as society and our own conscience would constitute narrow-mindedness. To be free to explore all forms of indulgence and wickedness is to be,""enlightened"". Therefore,the average human-bean,""like you and me"", wouldn't have the capacity nor the intelligence to comprehend unless they were as broad minded us those who cast off their restrains,e.g,""Easy Rider"", another movie of its kind.

280,2 March 2018,adam_pittavino,10, See it to believe it.,"Wild, young, charismatic hooligan Alex (Malcolm McDowell) finds pleasure and delight in Beethoven. He also seeks terrible thrills in violence and rape as he and his dysfunctional gang rampage their way through Stanley Kubrick's most adventurous and controversial piece of work. Masterfully directed, brilliantly portrayed, the story explores the parallels of youth and redemption, as near future England is a common playground for Alex and his teen delinquents to roam the night. They lie, steal, cheat and terrorize ordinary folk for self pride, joy and ultimately, self destruction. As Alex's over the top, dictating and bullying ways cause a tense battle for respect and appreciation amongst his followers, they finally wage war and realise the only way for free will is to teach their master a lesson of his own. As Alex is fooled and dishonoured in a planned act of vengeance by his gang and imprisoned for murder, he finds himself in the helpless vice of a radical new technique designed to rehabilitate and reform even the most menacing of criminals. But as Alex is released into the uninvited arms of the very society he once terrified, he begins to learn that he isn't as welcome as he first thought. Written by Anthony Burgees in 1962, A Clockwork Orange is recognised as one of the first films to prove that cinema could be an exciting and profound art form. It was after all, shot at the beginning of movie makings greatest eras, the ground-breaking 1970's. Stanley Kubrick has succeeded in delivering a masterpiece of risqué and energetic storytelling, as we witness movie making at its absolute peak of creativity and imaginative brilliance.",
281,25 June 2002,jaesboxer,10, My Favorite Movie Of All Time!,"Stanley Kubrick's dark, ultra-violent and morbidly witty masterpiece is a film that cannot be seen indifferently.  Those who view it fall distinctly into two seperate and opposed attitudes:  Those who think it is nauseatingly sick, and those who love it.  I fall into the latter category.  This is my all time favorite movie.  It is probably one of the most controversial films in history, and certainly Kubrick's most daring.  The entire length of the movie, adapted from Anthony Burgess' dark novel, is unrelentingly violent, horrifying and if you can laugh at those things, you'll love it.  THe story is as fascinating as the main character Alex, dealing with the concept of human choice in a delightfully sadistic way.  But the concept itself is not the only attraction, Alex himself creates a positively delightful love-hate relationship between himself and the viewer.  His napoleanic complex and fascination with his own sense of control is brilliantly portrayed by Malcolm MacDowell.  When released in 1971, this film received an X-Rating, and while it would be less controversial today, it still has enough violence, sex, nudity, rape and sadism to transcend almost all the films punched out by today's ultra-violent, MTV driven culture.  In conclusion, while not a film for everyone, A Clockwork ORange is an undisputed masterpiece with an everlasting appeal for those of use who can laugh at ""a bit of the ole' ultra-violence.""",

The movie is a great work for me because it can make me feel two different types of attitude towards Alex. At first I was utterly disgusted by what he and his gang do in their spare time on the first chapter. But then when the 'full circle' revenge is exacted by the cripple, I was kind of sorry for him to have endured such atrocities. But then the feeling return back to normal when the conversation with the psychiatrist happens. The acting is okay in overall.

Of course ""A Clockwork Orange"" has its critics - indeed, what film doesn't? - but none of these narrow-minded individuals can prevent me from appreciating the film.  A grim vision of the future sees young Alex (a career-best performance from Malcolm MacDowell) and his band of 'droogs' (there are a lot of post-modern slang words used in the film, by the way) who spend every evening beating, raping and pillaging innocent people for their own amusement.  In 1971, the film understandably caused outrage for its graphic violence and sexual scenes but by modern standards they are what cinema-goers have come to expect.

While the visual shock of the ""ultraviolence"" has diminished over time, the inherent perversity of the acts and the aloof demeanor and sociopathic sadism and apathy of the droogs can still elicit responses of disgust and repulsion from viewers.  However, the almost comic tone and musical-like choreography in Kubrick's presentation leave others wondering exactly how to react and undermine the perceived severity of the crimes being committed.  Nevertheless, Malcolm Macdowell effectively captures the amoral essence of Alex on-screen, his charismatic and well-mannered veneer belying his perverted and ingrained sociopathic tendencies.  After an arrogant power trip and betrayal by his disillusioned droogs, Alex goes to prison.  There, he learns of and enrolls in an experimental aversion therapy program in an effort to rehabilitate himself (although it is unclear if his motives are to get better or to get out of jail more quickly).  The tables are then turned on Alex, and the viewer is shown that the inhumanity of society's punishment is as repulsive as the depravity of Alex's crimes.  The film raises a variety of socially relevant questions: Is society truly able to ever rehabilitate criminals? (is this Alex's case solely, or youth in general?) What are the dangers of allowing society to remove free will in exchange for security?  What means, if any, are useful and/or justifiable to change the inherent nature of a person? With increased fear in the present age, societally and self-imposed suspensions of freedom, and recent phenomena like the reprehensible idea of ""the criminal as victim"", Burgess's prescience and Kubrick's provocative vision of Burgess's dystopia seem quite relevant and foreboding.",

By the same token, I recognize in it (and in most of what Kubrick did) an almost amateurish overindulgence. Being by nature a photographer, his emphasis was naturally on the Visual; characters were there to simply enhance the shots he set up. In A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, long static scenes unfold (one after another) as the camera sits and watches. This is a habit many low budget, indie filmmakers engage/indulge in: I've done it myself over the years. But it's a mistake when a paid professional does it because it results in what could best be called ""motionless pictures."" So intent is Kubrick on the Visual in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE that he never even bothers to explain the significance of the title. A small oversight, perhaps, but an oversight nonetheless.",

The exploration of human psychology as much as the moral implications of free will are quintessential in Kubrick's work. Kubrick has the amusing particularity that at the end of his films, one feels like in a state of ecstasy, awaiting something else to happen. They seem to end in a ""To be continued"" mood, which leaves the viewer with profound philosophical questions. The topic of insanity which constantly arises in Kubrick's films, is nowhere best treated that in this work of art, clearly the greatest achievement by any director, dead or alive(maybe in the same rank as Fellini, Chaplin, Truffaut and the great European masters).",

Then he is merely a clockwork orange, pleasing to the eye (orange), and yet perfect, a puppet of god or the devil that is as predictable as clockwork.

He treats everybody in the gang like crap. So about 20 minutes into the movie the gang smashes milk mixed with some kind of drug (can't remember what it was, also he had just gone in to kill a woman at a house) into his face which makes him lose his vision for a while. The police pick him up and take him to jail. He is put in prison. Then while he is in prison he hears of an experiment that will make bad people good. So he participates in it. The experiment involves him watching violent images on a movie theater screen while it plays Beetoban (can't remember how you spell it) with his eyes winged open with well I forget how they made his eyes stay open. It drives him crazy. But after that he gets to go home. Some guy says something he doesn't like while he is there and he tries to beat him up but then he falls over when he tries to do it. Later his parents kick him out of their house and he ends up running elsewhere. He runs into the guys from the gang he used to lead. They're cops now. They beat him up. He ends up at a house of man who's daughter was raped and killed by him and his gang. The man doesn't recognize him at first but later he does recognize him and tries to kill him. He ends up in the hospital where the government guys who sent him to the experiment come back and release him. But then at the very end he goes back to being a rapist! That's what I hate about the movie! My cousin likes this and said, ""I liked it because it's about how you can change the way someone thinks but you can't change who they are."" I hated the ending. He should've been good at the end but he goes back to being a rapist! And that is why I give this a 1. He should've just gone away from crime and led an ordinary life but he didn't.

362,12 July 2005,jboothmillard,8, A Clockwork Orange,"This film was initially a huge success when released, but when news broke out of two horrific copycat incidents, it was immediately banned by its own director, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Stanley Kubrick (The Shining, Full Metal Jacket). It was only after his death in 1999 that the film was allowed to be released to the public on home video and DVD, but even before the ban, and today, it is considered a cult classic. Basically it is a futuristic Britain, where Alex De Large (Golden Globe nominated Malcolm McDowell) is the leader of a teenage gang of hooligans, the ""Droogs"", who go out every night carrying out acts of ""ultraviolence"" for fun. They attack an innocent old Tramp (Paul Farrell), attack old author Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee) and rape his wife in their own home, and Alex murders a woman in her home with a giant phallic sculpture. Alex is sentenced to fourteen years, and after two he hears of a new experimental cure for prisoners that would get him out within two weeks, it is called the Ludovico Technique. It is a treatment where they clamp his eyes open and force him to watch horrific ultra-violent and rape crime, and coincidently the music playing is Alex's favourite composer, Ludwig Van Beethoven's 9th Symphony. The treatment is complete and Alex is shown to show extreme sickness when being faced with violence either to or from himself, and when he wants to caress a woman. Alex is released as a cured man, but his past comes back to haunt him when people he knew from his thug days make his new life torture. This includes the old tramp rounding up many others to attack him, Alex's thugs turned cops Georgie (James Marcus) and Dim (Warren Clarke), and most awful of all the mad Mr. Alexander torturing him with the 9th Symphony. It is the point of hearing the torturous music that Alex sees no other way out but suicide, but after jumping out of the window, he only breaks all his limbs. In the end, the experimental cure is abolished, Mr. Alexander is imprisoned for madness, and Alex rests in hospital knowing that he is now truly cured with his dark imagination. Also starring Michael Bates as Chief Guard, Worzel Gummidge's Anthony Sharp as Minister, Philip Stone as Dad, Sheila Raynor as Mum, Michael Tarn as Pete, Steven Berkoff as Constable, Star Wars' Dave Prowse as Julian and Coronation Street's John Savident as Conspirator. The most disturbing scenes of the film, before the nasty musical torture and clamping eyes, they are in the first thirty or so minutes. These are seeing a tramp very badly beaten, an old man attacked and his wife raped while Alex is singing the happy song ""Singin' in the Rain"", and the murder with the giant penis. The lead character and his friends speaking like old fashioned slang-spouting yobs is interesting when you consider it is meant to be a near future. This film is up there with Natural Born Killers, accused of glorifying violence (and rape), and it is also debated whether this is really a masterpiece, I would say if it gets many people talking and making an impact in Kubrick's career, then I believe it is. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Screenplay, Best Sound Track and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Alex De Large was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 54 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Films.

363,17 June 2003,descendent528,10, Well Well Welly Well Well What's it Going to Be Then Eh?,"What a day it has been my droogies, for I have completed the novel (in just under a week at that) and viewed Stanely Kubrick's take on it in the same waking day. I, sadly saw the film before reading the book but to my advantage, the first and only time that I had seen the film was nearly a year and a half ago. However, while reading the book I know what is going to come next and I cannot use my imagination to create my own image of the characters and their surroundings. Fortunatly, Stanley Kubrick did a wonderful job with the characters and I believe, the story as well. I do not believe that anyone else aside from Malcom McDowell could have filled the big and blood coated shoes of Alex as well as he. His performance in the film is marvelous and unforgetteble. I had planned to read the book and had it in my possession when a friend of mine encouraged me to read it, yet mentioned that the film did the book no justice. I disagree, for I think the film follows the book very well with the exception of a few bits and pieces and age differences (though we can't very well have a group of men raping a ten year old girl on screen can we?) which, actually, takes away from the power of the book. The fact being, in the book Alex is 15 years old and the film shows him as much older, not much, 3 or 4 years perhaps but still, a great difference. One difference that fell ill with me (Spoilers) was the discovery by Alexander that Alex was the one whom had been in on the brutal rape of his wife all those years ago. The discovery in the book is slow and picked up through Alex's use of language to Alexander. This was one of my favorite parts of the book and was saddened at not finding it done in the film. The language used in the book is so wonderfully used and executed and leaves such an impact, i figure that it could be rather hard to put onscreen and to be completely understood by the audience in just two hours. The book allows you to learn the language as you go along and now, I find myself speaking in minor nadsat in daily conversation. For instance, someone asks how I am doing and I give them a ""Real horrorshow"" and kind of chuckle a malankey bit. My suggestion: Read the book first and watch the movie. I believe that Stanley Kubrick has done a very good job at adapting this book and producing this film on its behalf. Wonderfully directed, acted, scored, and shot, I really like this story a lot, but that's another story with politics and such that I do not feel like getting into at the moment.",

He is sentenced to fourteen years in prison but after two years hears of a revolutionary treatment that will cure him of his antisocial tendencies and enable him to be released quickly. The treatment, a form of aversion therapy works perfectly; he feels violently sick whenever confronted by violence or sexual urges as well as accidentally robbing him of the ability to enjoy his beloved Ninth Symphony.

Stanley was no stranger to controversy (he adapted the novel Lolita back in 1962), but the firestorm associated with this film would make Lolita look like a Disney film by comparison. The film takes place in a futuristic England and centers around Alex DeLarge, a psychopathic teenager who leads a gang of thugs and rapists. He and his ""droog"" (friends) speak in a special slang called Nadsat, which was invented by the author of the book. Alex is played by Malcolm McDowell. To get an idea how good he was in this role, check out the rest of his work. Nearly every role he played after this had roots in this villain (especially Caligula).

386,19 January 2006,Sylviastel,10, What Kubrick does best?,"I have only seen this film once and yet I probably will watch it again. It's kind of painful to watch sometimes especially those scenes in the prison. Malcolm McDowell should be knighted by now. His role of Alex, the criminal, becomes a three dimensional character rather than just a caricature. Of course, the late great Stanley Kubrick provides spectacular images and scenes with color and unforgettable music. The movie shows a futuristic society in which the criminal like Alex can be cured but mostly by some of the most inhumane motives. I don't approve of Alex's crimes but I don't think cruel punishment is the way to redeem and cure the hard criminal. Because once he goes on the outside, he reunites with some of his victims. They return the crime. So crime begets crime, victim becomes criminal and the reformed criminal like Alex becomes a victim of society. This film ponders the questions about curing criminals. By making him a victim of crime, he becomes the victim. The sad truth is that it does not work. Criminals like Alex need psychotherapy, drugs, and something more than watching Nazi films about abuse. BUt I'll definitely watch this film again. With Kubrick, you can never get enough, boy do I miss him.",

With themes and social commentary in every frame, ACO is a very deep and thought provoking movie. It's one of the most controversial films of all time. This is where the film shows its age, as some of its content seems slightly tame compared to modern cinema. However, ACO is a harrowing, terrifying and deliriously brilliant movie which is more gut wrenchingly frightening than any theme park attraction; not because of the violence, but because of the haunting themes and chilling relevance over 40 years after its release. It's not the easiest watch, but you will not be able to get it out of your head. From the opening shot, in which an excellent Malcolm McDowall gives you the Kubrick glare, you'll be utterly hooked.",

The photography of this movie is absolutely excellent. This movie is a picaresque novel about one Alex the Droog. He is outside the Establishment and embroiled in the establishment-which spits him out its maw. It is supposed to cheer and encourage any young man to throw over the old farty bastards and establish a new order. And now we have the Clintons, and their hippie camp-followers . This was the movie which was supposed to set Malcolm McDowell's career on a high flight into the stratosphere. I find that a serious bad thing, because Malcolm didn't make it as a star. Malcolm is a genuine star, with acting qualities we all recognize. This movie really shocked me and caused mental damage-because I didn't have the mental discipline, or artistic maturity to absorb it. Oh well. I was a teenager and I will survive. This is a gigantically artistic movie for its time. It is elegant in its editing. It is powerful: The colors and angles and script and direction all coalesce into an intense anti-establishment statement which stand as art even today. It is a creature of 1972.

We all are pointing our fingers on Alex De Large because we don't have the decent honesty to reckon there's something absolutely magnetic in this character.

400,11 March 2017,charlesem,7," Yes, but....","Any movie that was panned by Pauline Kael, Andrew Sarris, and Roger Ebert can't be all bad, can it? A Clockwork Orange remains one of Stanley Kubrick's most popular films, with an 8.4 rating on IMDb and a 90% fresh rating (93% audience score) on Rotten Tomatoes. I think it's a tribute to Kubrick that the movie can elicit such widely divergent responses. I can see what Kael, Sarris, and Ebert are complaining about while at the same time admitting that the film is undeniably entertaining in a ""horrorshow"" way: that being both novelist Anthony Burgess's Nadsat coinage from the Russian word ""khorosho,"" meaning ""good,"" and the English literal sense. For it is a kind of horror movie, with Alex (Malcom McDowell) as the monster spawned by modern society -- implacable, controlled only by the most drastic and abhorrent means, in this case a kind of behavioral conditioning. Watching it this time I was struck by how much the aversion therapy to which Alex is subjected reminds me of the attempts to convert gay people to heterosexuality. Which is not to say that Kubrick's film isn't exploitative in the extreme, relying on images of violence and sexuality that almost justify Kael's suggestion that Kubrick is a kind of failed pornographer. It is not the kind of movie that should go without what today are called ""trigger warnings."" What's good about A Clockwork Orange is certainly Malcolm McDowell's performance as Alex, one of the few really complex human beings in Kubrick's caricature-infested films. Some of his most memorable scenes in the movie were partly improvised, as when he sings ""Singin' in the Rain"" during his attack on the Alexanders, and when he opens his mouth like a bird when the minister of the interior is feeding him. Kubrick received three Oscar nominations, as producer, director, and screenwriter, and film editor Bill Butler was also nominated, but the movie won none, losing in all four categories to The French Connection (William Friedkin, 1971). It deserved nominations not only for McDowell, but also for John Alcott's cinematography and John Barry's production design. (charlesmatthews.blogspot.com)",

409,31 January 2003,MrWhite2,10, Stanley Kubrick's best film!,"Untill 1971, the song ""Singing in the Rain"" from the movie ""Singing in the Rain"" was a nice happy song. After 1971, most people who hear it think about the use of it in ""A Clockwork Orange"". The main character, Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) sings it as he and his so-called droogs, beat up an older gentleman and rape his young wife. This violent, and sometimes unbearable to watch scene is what makes this film so interesting, good, and daring. I think this film is an excellent horror/fantasy/sci-fi flick! Personally, it is one of my favorite movies. The direction is absolutley brilliant, the writing is very good, the acting is great (Malcolm McDowell hands in a haunting, scary, and impecable performance that is still memorable today).

The first 45 minutes or so is absolutely perfect, and as a result the rest of the film feels slow and disappointing, but it all works together at the end. McDowell is fantastic and Kubrick's twisted direction is expectedly solid. The combination of classical music and that haunting, synthesized score is brilliant, and makes for some of the most memorable moments in cinematic history. ""Singin' in the Rain"" will never be the same.

413,3 May 1999,b-a-h TNT-6,9, Some thoughts about A Clockwork Orange,"I have to agree with a previous comment about the detractors of this movie; it seems this is not the right movie for people who just wanna see the classic psycho movie characters and be scared (while laugh at the characters' foolishness inside). This is not that kind of movie; so just watch The Shining (a really good movie, btw) instead of this if that's what you want. ACO isn't, indeed, an easy movie; Stanley Kubrick did a wonderful job in trying to make the audience identify in Alex's character, while keeping Alex's character himself so unbelievably real that sometimes you think Malcolm McDowell was real crazy. That's probably why the movie is psychologically shocking (and no, you don't see that much blood or straight violence on the screen). This is not, indeed, a movie translation of the novel itself: although they share the sharp sense of humour of Alex's narrative, the story is slightly different, and the reader doesn't identify with ""the novel's Alex"" that much; as Burgess himself said, the movie is ""Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange"", the book is ""Anthony Burgess' a Clockwork Orange"". I'd say their aim was pretty different: Burgess' primary one was probably to describe society dehumanization, Kubrick wanted to show how criminals aren't ""aliens"" and sometimes respectable people aren't better than them. This is, probably, why the movie was dubbed ""disgusting"" by so many people. The movie is visually really different from anything else ever appeared on the screen: not at all hollywood-looking (nothing fancy looking here), and maybe that's another reason why the ""anti"" camp is still pretty big; nevertheless, I think Kubrick did a wonderful job in describing those ""futurible"" suburbs. One final note: the movie described a very close future when it came out; now it's probably more like ""an alternate world"", although really close to ours. That's why the movie itself still keeps his scary fascination.",

Of course there are others that I love, such as Antonioni, Bergman, Bunuel, Kurosawa, Ken Russell, Tarkovsky, Pasolini, Vittorio De Sica. But back to the topic, not before reminding that Mr. Kubrick was of Romanian origin, like me... (with a small difference, he was born in New York City, Free World, me in Bucharest City, Communist Romania...) So, A Clockwork Orange: we can write a whole novel or even a short prose about it... I saw the film several times, in different periods of time. I translated the film many times, just as they talk in the movie, uncensored, at the Romanian Cinematheque in Bucharest. Every time it fascinates me and I transpose myself right there in the action, living the life of Alex DeLarge(Malcolm McDowell). It is a fascinating story of this character and I feel a strong connection with Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud)in Les quatre cents coups (The 400 Blows (1959) of François Truffaut (another favorite of mine). It is something of my life in these characters, I had a troubled childhood myself, therefore I found me in these characters. I also find myself in Beethoven and in the manner that Kubrick used his music to tell us the story of Anthony Burgess. I found myself also in the music by Wendy Carlos(as Walter Carlos). The image, editing, directing, scenery, everything is grade 10 plus in this film. They wrote a lot about it (this is the review number 1330) so I'll finish making mention on two of the actors, Malcolm McDowell and Patrick Magee. I saw and appreciated both in many films. I saw Malcolm McDowell in films such as Caligula, If...., O Lucky Man !, Time After Time, Aces High, The Raging Moon. By far, A Clockwork Orange is his best film. I saw Patrick Magee in Marat / Sade, Barry Lyndon, Telephon, Chariots of Fire, Cromwell, Hard Contract, Zulu, Dementia 13, The Servant. Mr. Alexander is his best role.",

Four neanderthals, led by Alex (a brilliant Macdowell at his finest, through which the story is narrated in it's wonderfully brilliant dialogue of script) get their kicks, looting, beating up people, rape, what have you, until Mcdowell stuffs up badly and going too far, resulting i the taking of a life. Mcdowell's is sent to a prison, then a hospital, where his punishment becomes his treatment, where he voluntarily undertakes all these horrible experiments, that will hopefully rid and cure him, of all this impurity and evil, one horrible exercise has him forced to viddy all these sick films where he can't turn away, as having his eyes clamped open. Reformed, back in the public sector, he begins to sense somethings not right, as in his treatment, where he's suffering stomach cramps, whatever, and is not really expecting the quite cold or passive reception he gets from his folks + a new border. What did they really do to him in that hospital. ACO does ride high on style, so many wonderful images, you get off this film, like the nude statues in the milk bar, from which you obtain your daily source of nourishment in terms of milk and shakes. That fast forwarding rape scene was stupid though, I have to fault it, where I can't believe someone was actually affected by this scene. The scene I was much affected, where again, it pains me to think of, was one of Alex's droogies, getting whacked in the nuts, by Alex's stick, and flying side off into that fountain. Of course this undying hit won't sot well with everyone. It will disturb and challenge. I know people who hate the film, one person, saying it was the worst movie, he ever saw. This one, is in the eye of the beholder. You can't fault it's originality, and one that decides to push the envelope, so to speak. Mcdowell's performance is just a masterpiece, and honestly in spite of Alex's cruelty and wrong doings on others. we can't help feeling a bit sorry for the sod, who we really see get his act together, but it's here in the aftermath of his prison/hospital time, where a nice little spin, twist has been put on the story. It's funny too, without really meaning to be, but the onus here, is put on Mcdowell mainly, in how he brilliantly delivers some of his dialogue. An enticing R Rated experience, all the way.

420,8 June 2019,foxtografo,6, Lacks dept on the main character and realism on choreographs,"I watched this movie the first time years ago, before having read the book, and I thought it was good.
Now, years after, I had forgot quite a lot about the movie and I read the book without the influence of the movie.
Now I've seen the movie again, and I can see how much is lacking. Is not a bad movie, Kubrick's cinematography is always interesting, and the movie actually has every part or scene from the book, so is not a totally bad adaptation, and the story is told whole and quite faithfully.
Still I felt like it lacks emphasis in very important aspects of the original story, which shows how violent and hateful is Alex and really hardcore violence though the whole story, but not gratuitous, violence is as important as any other character in this case.
This movie is from 1971, so I totally understand the violence being a bit lowered, still, the choreographs look quite silly and fake, and in my opinion makes the hole thing look more ridiculous than shocking. Using better angles and lighting could have help achieving better and more realistic results on this matter.
Then, the initial part where Alex hangs out with his gang and we see how vicious, skilled in violence and smart he is, and how dominant he is with them and also with his family is totally lost in the movie, which makes the character's dept and the whole sense of conflict on the audience on if the ""treatment"" he receives is absolutely unnecessary. Here he's almost a nice guy.
Also I felt it was overacted a lot of times, acting wasn't great in my opinion.
Then, and this is totally my taste, the psychedelic atmosphere Kubrick's version has is not completely to my liking or how I imagined it while reading, but still a fair point to experiment by the director and it's undoubtedly interesting.
Good movie over all but in the end, it falls short in depth of the characters (the main mostly) and a bit overacted, but the story is there and it has a visual twist from the director to make it feel fresh.",

This part had no effect on any other part of the movie. It had no relevance whatsoever to the plot. It was just thrown in there. It was such a stupid, pointless graphic sex scene that was unnecessary and made me totally disrespect the film. I don't come to movies to watch porn. I come to movies to be entertained.

Every shot, dialogue, gesture, score, camera angle is chiseled, polished, studied to obsession and there is a meaning in every scene. No element available on screen is useless, meaningless. This pure masterpiece needs many many viewings, as you can guess. Malcolm Mac Dowell gives here his life time performance, it is for him THE role of his whole career.

Malcolm McDowell delivers a clever, tongue-in-cheek performance as Alex, the leader of a quartet of drools, a vicious group of young hoodlums who spend their nights stealing cars, fighting rival gangs, breaking into people's homes, and raping women. While other directors would simply exploit the violent elements of such a film without subtext, Kubrick maintains Burgess's dark, satirical social commentary. We watch Alex transform from a free-roaming miscreant into a convict used in a government experiment that attempts to reform criminals through an unorthodox new medical treatment. The catch, of course, is that this therapy may be nothing better than a quick cure-all for a society plagued by rampant crime. A Clockwork Orange works on many levels--visual, social, political, and sexual--and is one of the few films that hold up under repeated viewings. Kubrick not only presents colorfully arresting images, he also stylizes the film by utilizing classical music (and Wendy Carlos's electronic classical work) to underscore the violent scenes, which even today are disturbing in their display of sheer nihilism. Ironically, many fans of the film have missed that point, sadly being entertained by its brutality rather than being repulsed by it.",

I have read the book, and since it got great reviews, I was expecting a fantastic rendition of the ""must read"" by Anthony Burgess. That's not what I got. The movie played down the use of the ""slang"" words so prevalent in the book. In my opinion, that makes this book stand out among other futuristic, dystopian novels. So, they barely used the lingo, and then cut out several parts from the book! Important parts, nonetheless. All in all, I found this movie extrapolated the ""weirdness"" of the book, while generally brushing off the ethical implications that Burgess brings up, as well as other underlying concepts in the book. After I watched it, I asked my friends what they thought of the movie. ""So cool!"" ""So weird; loved it!"" ""It's one of my favorite movies!"" My next question? Whether or not they had read the book. None of them had. Looks like this movie dumbs-down the book for people who haven't read it. The one thing I did like was the eyelashes they gave Alex. He looks even more haunting than I expected him to with them. But then again, the movie didn't address what they were wearing, and numerous other things people wouldn't pick up on unless it was mentioned.

It manages to pulls off that slow but intriguing pase a strategy that has been used by the greatest directors of each generation such as Quentin Tarantino to Martin Scorsese.

455,21 June 2012,Cosmoeticadotcom,9, Great,"The character of Alex, as well, is one of the earliest examples of a 'true' anti-hero. I know many people might point to the roles of James Cagney or Humphrey Bogart, or of Orson Welles' performance of Harry Lime in The Third Man. But, in truth, neither Cagney nor Bogart were actors in a modern film, and their 'anti-heroes' were really more cartoony fictions than realistic; whereas McDowell's Alex is realistic, however stylized. But more than just the appeal of the anti-hero, Alex is a bon vivant, with an incredible lust for life (pro and con), and it is that factor, added to his being an anti-hero, that makes him such a memorable character. Whether he is raping, killing, listening to music, fighting, daydreaming, he is in every moment, and then some. This is why, when he is soul cauterized by the Ludovico Treatment, there is such a strong reaction, even by people who loathe his character to that point. It is also why the ending to the film, wherein Alex is 'cured' back to his evil self is so much more satisfying than Burgess's novel's original ending, wherein Alex grows bored with his old violent life, to which he has returned, and decides to 'grow up,' settle down, and get a wife and child. Although Kubrick's decision to go with the ending of the more cynical American version of the novel (in his screenplay) caused much dismay to Burgess (it never ceases to amaze how many artists do not fundamentally even get the points of their own works), it was the correct choice for the film, and a better and more realistic artistic statement. The truth is that Burgess's novel is not nearly as potent nor powerful as some earlier dystopian works, like George Orwell's Animal Farm nor 1984, nor Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. In fact, it's not even as interesting as A.E. Van Vogt's Slan (save for the introduction of the Nadsat lingo). The reason for the film's excellence is almost entirely on Kubrick's shoulders. While people can 'reform,' with the passage of time and advent of maturity (I am a prime example), this ending would have done two things to damage the film- 1) it would have meant Alex had lost the very thing which made him 'special,' and a great character- his savage lust for life, and 2) it would have shifted the focus of the ending away from the society which soul cauterized Alex back to Alex, and this would have emasculated the film's satiric edge. A Clockwork Orange, the film, is simply not about Alex nor youth hooliganism, but fundamental and institutionalized state terror. And it's because of this change of target by Kubrick that the film still blisters its audience today; the same cannot be said of Burgess's book. Had it just been a tract on young violence, or gangsterism it would have dated as badly as many other pop cultural films from the 1960s and 1970s.",

475,7 June 2003,Blade_Le_Flambeur,10," Sensational, a beautiful montage of music, feelings, and images","Stanley Kubrick's probably two most infamous films are A Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut. At the 1971 Academy Awards, this film was nominated for Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, and Editing. It is so very hard to put the brilliance of A Clockwork Orange into words. The film works on so many levels, from the brilliant score to the top of the line acting and the satirical photography. Many people have called it shocking and disturbing, but Steven Speilberg's Saving Private Ryan is 10 X as worse. As the troubled but ultimately intelligent Alex, Malcolm M. shines in his role by ultimately conveying a sort of child- like quality and at the same time a distant violent nature. He is perfectly adapted from the Alex in the novel. All the other actors do perfectly fine jobs, especially the Prison Chaplin who puts the ultimate message of the film into a few basic sentences. Kubrick's refined script is excellent, and is almost the exact same as the novel. Some minor details that have changed is that he focuses a bit too much on the ultra- violence and rape, and there is a lot less of the funny language that Alex and his pals use. Kubrick's direction treats this as a satire, and the viewer has all these images sent to his head. There are so many sequences when he suddenly does slow motion or when he puts it as if it's fast forward. Overall, A Clockwork Orange is everything you've heard and more. It's not exactly the most violent or disturbing film ever created, though there is quite a bit of nudity.

It has been known for its grotesque display of sex, violence, and music which make people rather squeamish but, hey, it didn't disturb the crap out of me. Stanley Kubrick never came across to me as a wonderful director and A Clockwork Orange is no exception. His work maybe daring but his films are to old fashioned and boring. 2001: A Space Odyssey was probably the most boringest movies ever because most of the time it was about a couple of monkeys sniffing each others butts. I don't see how people get into that sort of stuff. The ""Old-Ultraviolence"" moments were where you saw people being beaten to death or ladies being raped by a couple of hoodlums, as described in the film. Malcolm McDowell was truly great in this film but I can't say it's the best movie he has ever been in. I have hardly seen him act in any films but he is known for films that had nudity (like Caligula). He provides the role of someone who is angry and he uses his anger towards his victims. The accents from the actors in this film were particularly good if not weird. The film is banned in most countries for it's realism of sex and violence but, thankfully, it is not banned in Australia. The cover for this film is mysterious and...... ah sh*t......mmmm.............mysterious. Damn! I ran out of words. Please pardon that Language I would like to call French. Not the French spoken In France But the swearing French. Okay? So don't report me. The setting for this film could not have been better because it provided the exact atmosphere I needed. A Clockwork Orange will leave some peoples minds after two hours but with some, e.g. Old People, it will stay there with them forever and ever and ever.

491,23 December 2017,jrdnlwn,10, A brilliant work of art from the greatest filmmaker of all time,"There is no doubt that Stanley Kubrick was extraordinarily intelligent, and he is definitely my number one favorite filmmaker of all time. I love every one of his professional films, from The Killing (1956) to Eyes Wide Shut (1999). Each film of his clearly shows his expertise on a technical level, which for him began with still photography. The many topical issues, which are apparent in many of his films, have also been heavily discussed. His films, 2001: A Space Odyssey for example, have all received heavy criticism upon initial release. But no other film of Kubrick's has been as controversial as A Clockwork Orange. When I first saw A Clockwork Orange, I was a sophomore in high school. And, as you might expect, I was disgusted by what I had perceived as the cold, warped, and biased nature of the film, but I later realized how wrong I was. Just like many other viewers of the film, I was particularly negatively affected by the rape scene that occurs within the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film. However, after several more viewings of the film, and after thoroughly reading (and listening to) some rare interviews of Stanley Kubrick (I understand how much Kubrick disliked interviews), I began to understand not only his intentions, which were clearly misunderstood by many haters of the film, but also the brilliance and central idea of the film. Just like with any other Kubrick film, there is a lot to be said about A Clockwork Orange regarding the technical aspect and style of it, as well as the substance, intelligence, and brilliance that all lie beneath the surface of it. I advise you to BE CAREFUL before reading my review, because there are SPOILERS.",

In a masterful adaptation to the cinema of a famous literary work, Stanley Kubrik gives us a sinister vision of a future where things work in a considerably oppressive way. Malcom McDowell in the character of his life offers us an extraordinary superb performance, representing a young man who leads a group of misfits who have no scrupulous in devoting themselves to delectable activities such as violence, murder and rape. The character's presentation causes us to have sympathy: it is possible that most spectators want to be part of that group. Events are adjusted to demonstrate how society can deal with those who do not fit morality and good customs. It is difficult not to agree with the system in the face of the decline presented on the screen. The progress of the film is capital and majestic supported by supreme production and music by Brazilian composer Carlos who will undoubtedly remain forever as a standard for the best music in cinema.

It has plenty of philosophical content, an intriguing story, a wonderful performance by Malcolm McDowell and a great variety of unforgettable moments created by the images and the music of the film. This is Stanley Kubrick's best film ever, having more human substance to it than 2001: A Space Odyssey and more fun (even if it is dark) than any of his other films (except for Dr. Strangelove).

Malcolm McDowell is fantastic as Alex the troubled youth who gets brainwashed for his own good and suffers the consequences. And Beethoven's music is the perfect score for this film.

I had not gone out of my way to watch any older movies that people had considered classics. I discovered this movie funny enough through the Tenacious D movie. They had an ""A Clockwork Orange"" movie reference within the film that my dad pointed out to me and not knowing what that was I googled it and discovered the film. Just by watching little clips of the movie on YouTube I was immediately in love with the genius cinematography of it all. I then for Christmas received a $25 gift card for Xbox and I spent $20 of it on ""A Clockwork Orange"". From start to finish of the film I experienced so much and absolutely loved everything about it. The movie is absolutely flawless in my eyes and I feel the same amount of joy watching it for the 100th time just as I did watching it for the 1st time. This was the movie to open the gate for me to going back and watching some older films or more serious films and realizing that Drama films are not just boring films that parents like to watch.

I even just read Roger Ebert's own review of it and even he seems to not understand it. Maybe I'm wrong in this, but it seems to me that all you people just seem to not get the movie. Maybe I can explain it to you. The movie is about the ability to control society. The movie asks the question of whether or not society can be controlled without sacrificing art and creativity. Many of people might be asking how I came to conclusion. All I simply did was think about it. Rogert Ebert, in his review, said that the fact that Alex listens to Beethoven was completely pointless and served no point to the meaning and only helped to stylize the film more. He was wrong. The music Alex is so passionate about is supposed to represent art in our society. It is very important to the film. Alex himself represents all the violence in the world. In the film, a hospital attempts to ""cure"" Alex of his need to commit acts of violence but in the process of doing this, they also make him ""allergic"" to Beethoven. What the film is asking is ""can we cure society of violence without sacrificing art?"" This is the meaning to the film. It is not just some film glorifying violence, and it definitely not the definition of the word ""crap"". Please people, think about a film more before you start hating it.",

542,16 April 2006,morrison-dylan-fan,10, Burgess Clockwork is Kubricks Masterpiece.,"After just having read the very good novel,i was first unsure about how it would have been filmed.But after seeing it i feel this is a fantastic translation of the novel,and also (in my view) easily Kubricks masterpiece. The plot: In a future Britain.There are groups of teenagers called ""The Droogs"".The film focuses on a group of Droogs led by a teenager called Alex(Played by a great Malcolm McDowell.)The Droogs enjoy going out,and doing acts of what they call ""Ulta-Violence"",which is to beat up and to do harm to anybody.Everything is going well,till an up rival starts to happen within the group.While Alex tries to remain the main Droog.During one of there nights out for The Ulta-Violence.the other Droogs turn on him,and Alex gets sent to jail for murder!While Alex is at the jail,he finds out there is a new system which if he goes in for, he will be able to get out in two weeks!When he gets there he is told that he just has to do some ""simple tests"",which is to watch films,with certain music playing with them.While first to Alex this sounds easy.As he goes on he finds out that these ""Simple tests"" might have more of an effect on him then he thinks.... View on the film: One of the main things that the film does very cleverly (and one of only a handful of others do)is that it lets the viewer have there own interpretation of the film.While some may say that its not the right choice for Alex to like classical music (instead of things like The Doors,Stones,Stooges etc...)I feel that it really suited the character.One of the issues raised in the film, is to show how the mix of images/music can either lighten or darken the images that are on the screen.While it has been said that Burgess did not like how the book was adapted (mainly due to the ending.)I feel that the ending works really well for the film (if they had kept to the books ending,it would have been Alex in a wig and old make-up!)The other major issue the film raises is the use of the media (something for a film made in 1971,is even more important now,and something everyone should learn about due to the current world events.) Final view on the film: One of the most important,original movies ever made.Also it is easily (in my view) Stanley Kubricks masterpiece.",

Kubrick's work has always been unquestionable but this one stands out from the rest in the most classic, unique and artistic manner. The first scene of this movie introduces you to the director's vision and the accent is very catchy. Malcolm McDowell is Alex for all that he does in the movie. The music blends in fantastically and the lighting is something I can go on and on about. A very noticeable attribute for this movie would be that every scene is divided - more of different short stories but connected to one character which links them all. The jail house scene is my favorite. As writers one would tend to overlook small details which have been taken care of here as the jailer describes all of Alex's belongings. Procedural scripting and amazing lights is what makes the movie. The performances are out of this world and the rape scenes turn you on. I don't think i've seen a movie so complete before.",

546,23 September 2013,JPfanatic93,8, Kubrick's examination of violence and free will is still relevant,"Nightmarish, highly stylized and plain bizarre, this remains one of the most controversial motion pictures of all time. Kubrick adapts Anthony Burgess' original novel with more visual flair than we're used to even from him, painting a ghoulish, depraved world in the not so distant future (at least, in 1971) where youth violence has run rampant. Malcolm McDowell, not one to turn down a shocking movie (like Caligula at the end of the decade), stars as the completely messed up sociopath gang leader Alex DeLarge whose various hobbies include hanging out at the local bar and taking illicit substances, classical music, raping women and just beating people for the fun of it. One night, he goes a little too far, which ends up in a trip to jail, where he volunteers for a scientific project designed to make offenders reject violence. After undergoing the experiments he is released and finds himself back on the streets, having to cope with the aftereffects of his actions when running into his old acquaintances, with not so nice results for his health, physically and mentally. The grotesque and haunting visual imagery aside, the film deals with the philosophical matter of freedom of will, as Alex is robbed of his in society's effort to keep kids like him in line, with dire consequences for the now peaceful subjects: are they really 'them' afterwards, being robbed of their choice to be violent or not? Of course most audiences ignored its thematic value and focused too much on Kubrick's portrayal of ruthless violence, which – despite his outrageous displays of 'Verfremdung' to make it easier on the soul – are still quite disturbing, ultimately leading to this film receiving X ratings around the globe and being withdrawn from UK circulation at Kubrick's insistence because it was said to inspire several violent incidents involving youths. It wasn't until Kubrick's death the film was finally allowed to be shown in British movie theaters.",

The characters are well developed, and there can never be too many hot women in any movie. Superiorly original concept by the author Burgess, but putting it on screen is entirely a different ballpark. I couldn't wait to see it again.

It also had nice little musical numbers like Alex singing ""singing in the rain"".  Another thing a found neat in this movie were the words Alex and his friends used giving you a bit more reason to pay closer attention to what they say in this. There are still some words I don't know the meaning of .  He used odd words like Guliver and Yarbles.  Anyway I can see why this won a few Acadamy awards.

567,29 May 2023,CinemaSerf,7, A Clockwork Orange,"This is a truly challenging film that routinely glorifies violence - especially towards women, and offers us a terrifying appraisal of the effects of unfettered government and science working in cahoots with each other. Fifty years on from it's groundbreaking release, it's great to watch this on a big screen again - and though the imagery is much less potent that it was in 1971, the performance from Malcolm McDowell is scarily compelling. The plot centres around him and his three sadistic cohorts who live a disparate life terrorising wherever they roam until finally they go a little too far and he is apprehended. A fourteen year sentence is handed down but after two of them, he seeks enrolment in a controversial, experimental, aversion therapy scheme the results of which don't quite deliver as expected. The film presents us with some some pretty gruesome worst-case scenarios to start with, those serve to exaggerate the threat to normal livelihoods and thus lend credibility to the even more daunting prospect of the clinical conditioning of people. In this case, it is specifically the conditioning of one violent individual, but it's very easy to extend the principle to those with whom the government, or state, might disagree - and Kubrick lays that threat bare for all to see and evaluate. I struggled a bit with the nonsense language at times, it seemed puerile and prone to ridicule, certainly to detract from, the more thought-provoking elements of the plot. Perhaps it is there to serve as steam-valve for the intensity of the subject matter, but I am not convinced it is effective or necessary. The book allows us scope to use our own imagination as to the terror this whole concept could invoke, but as film adaptations go, this one offers us a great and innovative template for any interpretation, and coupled with the powerful use of a classical music score - including Ludwig Van, of course, and a solid supporting cast contributing well, this is a truly momentous piece of cinema.",

It sets standards that haven't been touched ever since.  The film establishes a rhythmic style carried through the whole film.  The director is as the top of his form, Stanley Kubrick, the only live action director I call a genius anymore.  In wake of most people not understanding the complexity of its art, I'm still after over a dozen viewings in awe of his achievement (and Burgesse's...I'm a huge fan of the novel as well.)  We have entertainment, beauty, direction, music, choreography, acting, writing , ideas, and all together art working in unison throughout this incredibly fast paced two hour movie.  I lost faith in Hollywood for the most part. There is a very small margin of art being produced (or having been produced for that matter) but A Clockwork Orange (and the philosophical-poetic virtuoso 2001) reaffirms that watching the movies is worth sifting through all this popcorn trash and finding life affirming beauty and art.  Let us rejoice in the glory that is A Clockwork Orange bellowing in the face of all that is tyrannical, commercial, exploitative, dumb, pretentious, meaningless waste.  Amen, good night.",

Those scenes are just as exploitative as the rape scenes from the first two Death Wish movies. (Wow, I just compared Michael Winner to Stanley Kubrick.) Another demerit is that it's hard to call a comedy a good movie when a lot of the laughs are unintentional. That said, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is often quite compelling. It has excellent performances from the entire cast and terrific music. I just wouldn't rank it up there with Kubrick's best work. This movie is required viewing. (P.S.

Plenty has been told regarding the impact of his A Clockwork Orange upon its original release, yet even looking at the film in it's own terms, it's easy to see why it's regarded as such a masterpiece. Kubrick adapted Anthony Burgess's equally brilliant book rather faithfully, but still giving the film his own mark. His films have been criticised for being cold and heartless, yet it's almost necessary for A Clockwork Orange to be filmed in such a style. Kubrick portrays his near-future as bleak and lacking the Utopian feel that most science-fiction writers were predicting. Reading the headlines in today's newspaper, the futuristic world depicted in A Clockwork Orange has unfortunately come true. This goes both for the portrayal of youthful aggression as well as the government's attempts to rid the world of it.",

Alex is the whimsical yet mischievous rascal in the American version as suggested by the publicist that never quite learns his lesson in spite of everyone he is up to his old tricks at the end. It is a That Darn Cat! Meets American Psycho. Disturbing. Offensive. Caters to depravity, rape, murder and cruelty as long as it is a 1st or 2nd degree felony. I would have given it a higher rating for a student film. Maybe for the day it was something special. For me it just set the stage for many to copy the shock and awe of a sideshow that was wildly blooming societal cancer. The women were beautiful. The way they were used was ugly. Nudity, sex and love making have much greater depth than this crazed episode. The hero of the film leads a gang that murders a harmless old man that has had too much to drink. They lie their way into a home then invade raping, beating and torturing the woman and man that let them in. The only way not to criticize this film is to praise it and quickly move on with a deep breath and a pallet cleanser. The movie says ""This is a really bad thing but I will tempt you and show you how to love it and live with a nagging, unhappy conscience forever tainted and damaged."" Child porn with adult actors. Every creepy thing you ever feared about awkward situations. I guess you could say it was something, hype. Hyped like the wizard in the Wizard of OZ. Every sick thing you every thought the babysitter might do in your absence. If I was crack piped out of my head and decided to make a movie I'd wash down some pills with moonshine and this would be it. It says, ""Watch my movie and I will reward you with nudity in all the wrong ways that will influence weak minds to commit heinous crimes."" A cautionary tale for an audience that is too young to view it. It's like watching the possessed demon in the Exorcist run for president. The women were carefully chosen and shown according to their physical appearance used to make the unsavory parts more bearable. The rest of the movie makes supremacists, water boarding, prison rape and torch bearing homicidal vigilantes look normal and successful. The present day equivalent would be the conviction, treatment and reinstatement of a sexual predator after much suffering and the ability to put the blame on the government (A Clockwork Orange 2). Murder now seems considered marginally justifiable depending on which propaganda you follow as long as you don't get caught by the proper authorities or political party.

When the book fell short in detail, Kubrick took the opportunity to portray the world of Alex the Large with stunning sets filled with sexual imagery and disturbing surrealism. While there is no real concrete reason for this, it helps create the bizarre atmosphere of ""A Clockwork Orange"". All of Kubrick's original touches (""Siiiiingin' in the rain!"") add to the story rather than take away from it, though Burgess would never admit it. ""Clockwork Orange"" is one of the most visually striking films of all time. The camera angles are distorted and uncomfortable, with iconic shots such as Alex's smug stare into the camera from beneath his eyebrows, and the phallic nose of his mask sticking out into the line of sight of his most unfortunate victim. Also triumphant is the soundtrack, which combines synthesized droning (especially ""The Funeral of Queen Mary"", one of my favorite movie themes) with the works of Beethoven so beloved by Alex.

From McDowell's eerie iconic performance to the controversy over its supposedly ""pornographic"" violence to its satirical portrayal of governmental and civic abuse of liberty, this utterly genre-less work of sublimity remains one of those mystifying pinwheels of the cinema. Kubrick's painterly, insoluble kaleidoscope is most often explained as political satire, or dystopian sci-fi, or a crime drama, while its intersecting allure to the horror fan community is clearly pervasive. Though I don't pretend to entirely understand this film, I nevertheless find it profound and unique, especially in its loaded portrayal of the psychosomatic associations we make with music, or that music makes with us. A crucial musical instant in Kubrick's inspired carrying out of Anthony Burgess' inventive story comes when Alex bursts into song in the bath.",

590,13 July 2006,GOWBTW,10, The future has never been so disturbing!,"Stanley Kubrik has put up a fine sci-fi thriller about the future where total chaos rules. Even if the world doesn't look like the Apocalypse, the society running with vermin make it look that way. Especially where the The Droogs live. In a futuristic England, these degenerates run around causing havoc and mayhem. They kill, rape, and brutalize anyone who got in their way. Alex(Malcom McDowell) leads the way of these ruthless gangs. He later shows his brutality on his own friends when he hits one of them in the groin with his cane, and hidden inside is a knife that cuts the other's hand. Knowing that he tends to himself at home, out in the open, he's an bomb ready to explode. In one scene, the attacks the woman, his friends leave him behind by breaking his nose with a milk bottle. While Alex is doing some time, I liked the scene were he was being reformed in a sadistic way, where he literally goes out of his mind. Hoping that he is ""cured"" he goes back to society, where his ""friends"" are in law-enforcement. After that suicide attempt, the country gives him the clemency, to me that was not a good idea, after he said, ""I was 'cured' all right!""

596,24 January 2002,The Doctor-2,10, One of Kubrick's best,"From the cold, haunting, electronic opening theme of A Clockwork Orange (written and directed by Stanely Kubrick), you can tell immediately that this will be a very unsettling film.  Alex's (played by Malcolm McDowell) leering stare into the camera, as it slowly zooms away, is very menacing, and you can tell instantly that this isn't a fellow to be messed with! Through the narration, he tells you of his gang or his droogs as he calls them, and his fondness for something called 'ultra-violence'.   We then come to the first scene, where he and his gang savagely beat up a defenceless old drunkard.  Then they get into a fight with another gang, which is played to classical musical, but strangely enough, it seems to fit in perfectly with the violence on screen,  which I think is part of Stanely Kubrick's skill as a director.  After that, they steal a car, and go joy riding down a country lane, with little regard at all to any other people on the road.  They then come to a quiet house, owned by a writer and his wife, which they have chosen for what Alex calls, 'Surprise visit'.  What this surprise visit consists of is forcing their way into the house, trashing up there home, and in between beating up the writer, raping his wife in front of him, Alex cheerfully sings, 'Singin'' in the Rain'.  It's such a horrible, disconcerting, violent scene that it's really very difficult to watch, and all this happens in the first few opening scenes!  But it isn't as bleak as this the whole way through.  There are some nice, comical touches to it, such as Alex's slimy parole officer, who at the end of every sentences says, `Yes?', and tries on several occasions to touch Alex up.  Also, when Alex eventually goes to prison for killing a lady, the warden (played by Michael Bates) seems as if he's stepped straight out of the set of 'Porridge', as he's very similar Mr. MacKay, albeit he swears a whole lot more!  There's also the prison priest, who's a rather amusing character, too.  However, the most complicated character in the whole film is Alex.  Although he has committed some awful crimes, for some reason, and I think this is partly down to Malcolm MacDowell's acting, and Stanely Kubrick's direction, you not only feel sorry for him, but you identify and sympathise with him.  Alex is, essentially, still a child, as he lives with his parents, and goes to school.  Also, when he's told that one of his victims is now dead, he's speechless, almost as if it's never occurred to him that somebody could die from his actions.   He keeps a pet too, a snake called Basil, which although is an usual animal to have, it does show that he has a sensitive side. Also, there is a far darker side to his personality, too.  When he reads the Bible, he fantasies about torturing Jesus, and leading many of the battles that happened in the Old Testemant, but has an angelic look on his face while reading it, making the priest think he's had some sort of religious enlightenment!   The main thing that you wonder when watching this film is what kind of society created Alex, and during his time in prison, that question is answered.  The government is clearly a near  state totalitarian state, and consider Alex to be a petty criminal, more concerned about political prisoners.   When Alex undergoes the Ludovico treatment, where he's forced to watch violent images of murders, rapes, and even footage from concentration camps, all to the music of Bethoven, in order to make him a 'better person'.  However, as the priest says, he has no choice on whether to be good or not, and that's essentially what makes us human.  Without the choice, we cease to be human beings, which is one of the many deep themes of the film.  Also, we get the impression that Alex has been through all this before, as his prohibition officer hints that he's been in trouble before, and at the end of the film, it appears that he's back to his old self again. In short, I think A Clockwork Orange is possibly one of Stanely Kubrick's greatest films, and is also one of the best films ever made.  It's a dark, twisted masterpiece of cinema.  It's a bit heavy going, but it's well worth watching!",
597,11 August 2002,dwpollar,8, Strange futuristic story...,"1st watched 8/10/2002 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Stanley Kubrick): Strange futuristic story of a ""ultra"" violent gang whose leader goes to jail and is rehabilitated by the government.  His rehabilitation is basically just to make him sick whenever he is about to be violent or have sex. They also made a little mistake in making him sick as well whenever he hears his favorite piece of music(Beethoven's 9th).  There is much controversy about the lewdness of the sexual perversions and the violent beatings that happen in the first half hour of the movie and this is about all we hear from the public, but the movie really becomes interesting after he's caught(at this point the perversion and most of the violence stops.)  The rest of the movie is a sometimes funny, very sarcastic look at how criminals are treated and how our government and ourselves react to varied things like the media and the fate of those who have murdered. There is so much discussion that can follow after this movie ends and I believe that's where Kubrick is when he's at his best.  Just like in ""2001;A Space Odyssey""  again he has pricked our minds and our senses to a strange, comic, dark, play on our soceity and given us much to think  about and much to learn from as we look at our present human condition.",

604,16 August 2007,Jonny_Numb,9, Kubrick's One True Masterpiece,"Stanley Kubrick is easily one of the most overrated directors of all time, but I will say that ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a singular masterpiece that still carries an effect, 36 years later. I think this has less to do with Kubrick the director than Kubrick the adapter--working from Anthony Burgess's novel of the same name, rich with food for thought, the director does not skimp on the intertwining strings of morality, religion, criminality, science, and the State that mark Alexander DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell, in an iconic role)'s descent through a literal mindf*ck in order to curtail his delinquent desires. Kubrick's ""point-and-stare"" technique, usually an invitation for sleep, is properly observant and well-utilized here: the characters convey the aforementioned commentary in a lively, sly way (from Alex's 'droogies' to the pitch-perfect Aubrey Morris as the perpetually-grinning Mr. Deltoid). While time has diminished the shocks that made the film controversial upon initial release, the morality-play structure is still well-executed and compelling, culminating in a scene revolving around Alex, a plate of spaghetti, and a bottle of wine that is nothing short of masterful. There are many more scenes like this, but like the rest of ""A Clockwork Orange""--they are best experienced cold. Highly recommended, and that's coming from someone who thinks the rest of Kubrick's filmography is negligible.",
605,16 February 2005,El_Rey_De_Movies,10, A brutally violent yet intellectually challenging classic,"It amazes me how a movie like this, which was so hugely controversial when it was released, can be so completely ignored now by the average movie watcher. Kubrick was widely reviled because of the way he pushed the boundaries of what was considered ""acceptable"" in movies  specifically, sex and violence, the two-headed cultural Hydra that continues to fascinate and repel us. Although I've read a number of reviews that chastise the film for being ""old hat"" and really no big deal here at the beginning of the 21st Century, I have to admit that this picture is still as shocking, brutal, comic, nihilistic, and philosophically challenging now as it was in 1971  and if someone tells you different, then get the hell away from that person because they've become so desensitized to violence that they'd probably think that the 5-car pileup they just passed was faked because the blood didn't look real! But under all the violence, what Kubrick gave us is a parable, narrated by Malcolm McDowell like some demented younger brother of Fielding's Tom Jones, about choice. The plot is the story of Alex, a young ne'er-do-well living off his parents in a cookie-cutter flat in a slightly-futuristic London who cuts class during the day and hangs out at night with his ""droogs"" in a bar where they serve milk laced with various drugs  which is just a prelude for ""a bit of the old ultra-violence"", as Alex calls it. Kubrick shows their various escapades and adventures, that escalate from a simple joyride to a rumble...to a harrowing home invasion where Alex sings ""Singin' in the Rain"" while beating the living crap out of the writer who lives there  which is then followed by a ball gag in his mouth so he can watch Alex and his gang beat and gang-rape his wife. Eventually, the gang turns on Alex because he's an arrogant, supercilious, conceited, manipulative son of a bitch who's not above sending his cane crashing into the balls of his gang-mates to assert his authority as leader. They set him up with a little breaking-and-entering action which Alex, sadist that he is, turns into a murder when he assaults the woman who lives there with a statue of a giant penis! He's convicted and sent to prison for 15 years, and normally that would be the end for someone like him. But not for our little hero, who discovers that he has an untapped talent for hypocrisy, a talent that he uses to manipulate the prison chaplain into making him first his assistant and then to get him accepted into the ""Ludovico Treatment"". Of course Alex doesn't care what the treatment is  all he cares about is that it will get him out of prison, permanently, in a fortnight, as a completely rehabilitated member of society. But, for once, Alex has outfoxed himself. The treatment is not some simple psychological counseling and job-training program  it's a new and radical method of re-sensitizing an individual, essentially a kind of massive negative reinforcement towards sex and violence. And THAT'S where the crux of the picture, the essence of Kubrick's argument lies. The treatment makes Alex physically sick and induces suicidal tendencies when he tries to act violently or engage in sexual activity, which makes him ""cured"" in the eyes of society and the government. But, as the chaplain says, he has lost the ability to choose his behavior and, in the end, isn't that the only thing that distinguishes man from beast? It isn't intelligence, it isn't laughter, it isn't the opposable thumb  it's the fact that, for human beings, there is really no such thing as instinctive behavior. Alex has not learned that his behavior is wrong, objectionable, evil  all he's learned is that if he tries to act that way, he'll feel like retching and killing himself. He's simply been programmed to respond in a specific way to specific stimuli, not to make any kind of moral choice. And not only is it not a permanent solution, it also has the unintended consequence of taking Beethoven's music away from Alex, who just loves ""Ludwig van"" but can't listen to the 9th Symphony anymore because it was the background music the treatment used! Filmed in Kubrick's signature chillingly documentary style, it's a picture that will make you laugh, cringe, but most of all, think.",

610,28 January 2020,RatedVforVinny,10, The most influential film in cinematic history.,"I suspect you won't get too many disapprovals to the above title. It indeed comes from the director with possibly the strongest back catalogue of movies and tackling a multitude of genres across the board. The clothing, style and attitude was thousands of miles away from his previous 2001 but it's intrinsically related. In an early scene a tramp even complains about man flying in space (just before receiving a terrible beating). The genius of Stanley Kubrick has been celebrated by many movie affectionados (fans and critics alike). 'A Clockwork Orange', adapted from a very important book by Anthony Burgess, pulls no punches and shocks the audience into a strange but stark reality. Kubrick got the very best performances from his carefully selected actors (as he always did) and Malcom MacDowell was arguably tops. Another smart move was to let his charismatic young star, improvise greatly in character. The most memorable scene is when Alex (MacDowell) prior to commiting rape, bursts into a song and dance 'Singing in the Rain', which he states, he ""just made up on the spot"". The film was pulled from being screened in the U. K by Stanley himself, over concernes that it might encourage copycat violence. It just might just be the most influential title to date, influencing a heady mix of society and including, artists, bands and look-alike football hooligans.",

It's story offers a masterful center character and great supporting characters throughout. Direction and camera-work are top notch. The lingo and conversations are wonderfully strange and bizarre spoken in British-dialect English - they give a cleverly added layer of different time and place. Clearly much thought is weighed on subjects of crime, punishment, and reform as central themes, but the motivation and drive of the story is an immersion into the hooligan mindset - an anarchy against societal rules and etiquette in total disregard of the government and fellow citizens. Questions are posed of age old punishments vs. new-wave reformations. Kubrick and the screenwriter have crafted the feel of mischief and mayhem better than any other movie to date imo. Malcolm McDowell's devilishly wanton character is the quintessential ""bad apple"", and wonderful to follow with expository narration. Great use of music as well. Highly recommended.",

Why this film didn't win all sorts of awards for art direction and costume design is beyond me.

Actually, most scenes are random and made only to show director's skills-- oh, I found a point for that scenes! I can surely eulogize the good directing of this picture; even thought some scenes aren't important, director make them in a fabulous way that entertains the spectator. I don't know which is better, the colors and scenario or background sound-- all are great. The question involving prison and human re-education is very creative, even more if you imagine it's been thought more than forty years ago. Also, most of the cast is very professional, of course praising Malcolm McDowell's extremely well done job-- I actually can't look at him normally anymore.

Blessing Hollywood with a long series of cinematic gems until his death in the late 90s, Kubrick has succeeded above the surface level when covering big topics such as politics, war, crime, and science-fiction (2001: A Space Odyssey). This early 70s dystopian thriller A Clockwork Orange made an enthralling commentary on violence and juvenile delinquency. The film garnered a fair amount of controversy for its graphic portrayal of violence and sexual mistreatment, initially landing it an X rating. Before too long, gained a major cult status to where it was named one of Stanley Kubrick's best work by many. Set in futuristic Britain, the film follows Alex DeLarge (played by Malcolm Dowell), a sadistic teenager with a love for violence, sex, and classic music by Ludwing Van Beethoven. He is the leader of a sociopathic gang of his friends Dim (played by Warren Clark), Georgie (played by James Marcus), and Pete (played by Michael Tarn) who commit series of vicious crimes around town including beatings and sexual assault. Upon killing a cat lady, his friends abandon him on the scene leading to the authorities to catch him and throw him in prison.

626,31 March 2008,DzeFrenchman,10, Jolly Brilliant,"This is a movie which is ahead of its time, both literally as figuratively. If you watch it, you really wouldn't put the year 1971 on it. We have to thank Stanley Kubrick for this. His (r)evolutionary ideas have been of most importance for the movie industry. He taught directors how they could break all rules, and so much more. For one, the cinematography is totally new and brings a whole new dimension to movies. Prove: the first scene... woooooooooooow! This could very well be the best opening scene ever. Stanley Kubrick is also one of the first directors who really cared about the meaning of music in a movie. It really gives you that violent feeling, love it! But the reason I watch this one over and over again is Alex. In my list of all-time favorite characters, he would definitely be in the top 5. The energy that goes out from him (probably caused by the milk-plus) is very, very intense and masterfully brought forward by Malcolm McDowell. This movie is complete, it has no lacks... so 10/10.",
627,30 January 2006,djjimmyvespa,8, One of the most bizarre and unique films ever attempted,"Of course it's not perfect...how could it be? Stanley Kubrick, the obsessive-compulsive auteur was the only choice (except for Ken Russell, who would have had a ball with it) to bring Anthony Burgess's brutally compelling novel to the screen, and he does a fine job. The opening shot, of a smirking, unblinking Alex, staring down the gradually retiring camera as he drinks spiked milk prior to going on a violent rampage of vagrant-beating, gang fights, joyriding, housebreaking and rape, makes sure the film grabs you from the start and doesn't let go. And what a journey it is! A CLOCKWORK ORANGE takes in everything, and I do mean everything, from high farce, black comedy, surrealism, British smut and schaedenfreude to some of the most disturbing, troubling and thought-provoking sequences ever committed to celluloid. It's a film that delights in pulling the carpet out from beneath the viewer, again and again and again. And it works on all kinds of levels, too - beneath the 'futuristic' veneer (which, for all I know, could have already looked dated in 1971) there's a virulent satire on the sheer, eyeball-coruscating ugliness of modern architecture, particularly the neo-brutalist school of characterless concrete blocks and swathes of hideous white cement that was cropping up all over Britain at the time. Then there are the 'minimalist' interiors, hideous costumes (especially on the female characters!), Godawful pieces of pop art trash...it's clear that Kubrick really HATED this stuff, and it must have been a conscious decision for him to dump the classically-minded misfit Alex (whose taste for Beethoven and the most sordid aspects of the Bible mark him out as one who abhors a shallow modernity, and rebels against it wherever possible) in the middle of a world that's so alienating and drab. A common complaint among British youths of the seventies, the nascent 'punks' in particular, was that ""everything's crap"" - and looking at the ghastly (and surprisingly, not TOO exaggerated) world of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, you can understand where they were coming from! I could banter about this film all day, druggies, but this is my perspective - it's one of the most vicious pieces of social satire ever created, and the legacy of the horrible world little Alex was rebelling against is still with us, decades later. Viddy well, little brothers!",
628,30 April 2023,owen-watts,7, Eggiwegs.,"Kubrick's mesmerically unsettling glance at an unimaginable future UK overtaken by the barbarically indifferent is somehow both extremely dated and weirdly timeless. Looking and sounding like a wild mash between the drugged-out end of the 1960s and some lost 18th C epic. It's a style-over-substance type affair as the narrative is fairly tissue thin. The alien framing of everything is far more fascinating than anything actually happening within it, especially after the bombastic first half an hour where it begins to lurch aimlessly onwards, bunching up and tumbling over one improbable coincidence to the next.

The film also drags in the 2nd half, and doesn't offer the most earth shattering argument about the state and violence. In many ways it recreates the Burgess novel faithfully.

638,6 June 2019,toffeello,10, Joy of irony,"It's a story of many things, maybe that's why some people cannot catch up with them all.
I just love that everything in the story has more than one side. Even Nadsat (the language the teens speak) is both dark and funny at the same time. Alex is like that too, he's sinister and wild and simultaneously charming and funny-looking. He's nasty but glee. He's senselessly violent but he loves to listen to Beethoven. He's terrifying but pathetic. It just breaks all the taboos.
But apart from all of that, the story itself is just something else. It's a perfect unique dystopia portrayed in such an unusual atmosphere. It raises a lot of ethical questions while doing that as well. Like good/evil or suppression/free will. It dazzles your mind with being so close to the reality.
At the end, after conditioning Alex, he shows impulses to hate, violence, lust and all the things that are called ""evil"". He becomes a so called decent person but without a soul. As he says himself at the end, he was cured all right. So what's the aim? It's a purely ironic redemption that the treatment was to return him to his previous ""free"" state. But not many people notice the fact that previous Alex was also a product of conditioning as well.
And above all, something that creeps people out more than Alex is that any current government is sick enough to try these cures. So, in Alex's own words: ""The colors of the real world only become real when you viddy them in a film.""",

A film unlike any other made, it is brilliant from beginning to end. It is also extremely violent, but violence in a future society is its primary subject matter, so it would be hard to avoid it and give an honest depiction. Malcolm McDowell, shockingly not Oscar nominated, has never been given a role remotely as good as this, though he did shine in an small film called If...., another controversial film made in this era. As his later career has proven, he really isn't the strongest actor, but he was born for this role. Oddly, no other cast member shines in this, but other than the lead, it is really a director and production designer's movie from beginning to end. Once again, Kubrick shows near genius in his choice of music to use. A harsh, not for all tastes, thoroughly original cinematic masterpiece.

About half way through the film the essential question is asked ""if a man is forced to be good and this is not his choice; then is he really good? Is he really a man?"" What is the essence of goodness, and what is free will? The film is supposed to be closely based on the acclaimed novel; however, I have not read it. Kubrick's filmmaking is stunning, unique, brutal, and violent. The images are disturbing. This looks at the conflict over the views on the nature of man, and that view impacts the response to crime and violence. 50 years later I feel the questions are the same, and we are no closer to answers. Law and order people may argue it doesn't matter whether good behavior is the result of free will; it is the result we seek. The humanist may not be so happy with that approach regardless of positive outcome. Aside from Other Kubrick films few movies evoke such conversations and thoughts.

Watching Clockwork Orange, you one moment have fun with its wicked sense of humour, incredible invented dialect (taken from Anthony Burgess' hilarious, inventive novel), and the next moment feel sick to the stomach. The first time i saw it i was absolutely terrified. I felt terribly sick in the stomach. Now, of course, it feels slightly less like Satan damning me to hell (and i'm not religious!) and more like a delightfully cinematic, delightfully dark joke. Each time i see it, I further appreciate it: it's visually stunning, menacingly comic and unashamedly controversial and shocking (with a touch of the old social satire, my droogs). It gets in your face and there's no stopping it. Does it all mean something? Is this our future described? That's for you to decide. What's certain is that Clockwork Orange defies every law about movie making ever invented, and defies categorisation at every turn.

It's intent was to show that we have to make our decisions ourself, no other human-being can. The main reason why it is misunderstood is because it excludes the 21st chapter that is in the book. This chapter tells of Alex's redemption, and his need to settle down. Alex wrong. Plain and simple, Anthony Burgess would never condone rape, for his wife was raped. But Alex realizes this at the end when he can think for himself and a ""treatment"", as it were, was not thinking for him. In other words, if you had a disability would you want someone taking care of you constantly, always making a fuss. No it's disconcerting, as humans we want to learn for ourself and be self-sufficient. That's what this is about. Alex got his punishment in jail, and out of jail, but in the end the human brain prevailed and he recognized the err of his ways. I strongly suggest to anyone confused after the movie to go read the book. This will help you to understand the reasoning of it being taken from Alex's perspective.

About the brutality and sex, while in 1971 this might have been a shocking movie, nowadays it is nothing special. What is interesting though is the way these scenes are presented, with the environment (sound, face expressions, scenery) contradicting with what is actually happening, trying to disorient the viewer and make him think if in his actual life he pays attention to the bare event or to the package that goes with it. What a contradiction is Beethoven's 9th with murder and rape, as even the protagonist admits in the film. In general this is a movie worked out in detail, but I think so much importance is given in the depth of particular scenes that the flow of the film is affected and it loses its coherency, making it difficult for a not determined viewer to sit and watch.

696,14 June 2020,jayjaycee,9," What a horrorshow adaptation, Oh my brothers!","""A Clockwork Orange"" is a 1971 sci-fi crime drama directed by Stanley Kubrick starring Malcolm McDowell and Patrick Magee. After only one week I have finished yet another novel and once again headed for the adaptation of it. The classic book of the same name, written by Anthony Burgess in 1961, heavily fascinated me with the colloquial style it was composed in, mostly because of the fictive teenage slang ""Nadsat"" that was used in it. It took me a while to figure out most of the vocabulary and hence my reading speed wasn't as high as it was with the previous books, but in the end it was no longer a problem to me and it felt like I had learned yet another language. In terms of content, the novel was intriguing as well, as it raises a moral debate and questions the determination of human beings, all the while describing extreme violence in all its forms unexpectedly explicitly. While reading it I had the feeling that this novel was controversial back in the day for a reason and that Stanley Kubrick would be the ideal man for adapting the infamous source material. All I can say is, he indeed did an amazing job with this film. On what coincidentally happened to be his birthday, I watched Malcolm McDowell delivering his career best performance and by Bog or God, it was marvellous. Already the first shot was enough for me to know that this film is about to become brilliant. Despite the fact that he was way too old to play a young teenager, him doing the famous ""Kubrick Stare"" while keeping a straight face and nipping on a glass of milk like it's the best drink in the whole world, with the infamous theme playing in the background is not only iconic but also masterclass acting. It is only a shot that runs for a few seconds, but it was enough for me to be immediately drawn into the situation. In the same uniquely manner McD continues to portray the sadistic gang leader Alex DeLarge, who is fond of classic music, especially Beethoven and loves to brutalize everything that comes in his way, and embodies every single drop of sinister blood that runs through the veins of this sinister fictional character. Aside from the stare in the beginning, it is the overconfident personality that eventually is converted into something emotionally disturbed that he masters effortlessly. He is charismatic, ultra-violent, unpredictable, and dangerously arrogant and portrays everything that Alex has been described as in the source material. His dazzling performance, with the transition and all respective facets, is what makes this film what it is today. He carries the whole film and without him, it would be less entertaining. The last time I had the feeling that a specific performance was the crucial point of a film was when I watched Hitchcock's horror classic ""Psycho"" (which ended up receiving a perfect score) and I rarely happen to get this feel. As I previously mentioned, Kubrick made this film in his unique directorial style and it shows at several things. The supporting actors are all extremely over the top (as they always are in his films) and had this inimitable oddity to them, but is not only the characters that are weird, it is also the design of the settings and locations that also share this distinct eccentricity. The novel takes place somewhere in the future, and the futuristic world Kubrick created looks like the early seventies but envisioned by some surrealistic artists, such as Dali or Picasso. Aside from dyed hair and questionable fashion, most of the shots are flooded with obscene paintings and statues and that adds a lot to the scandalous nature of the film. Speaking of scandalous, the movie also did everything right and unexpectedly depicted the most controversial scenes of the novel, at times only slightly altered for ethical reasons (I think no one ever would have approved a graphic sex scene between minors!). It was without a doubt surprising to see a film from that time show graphic violence, rape and sex scenes in such an explicit way only a few years after the Hays Code was abolished. Yes, the director hit at the correct spots and has shown the extreme nastiness that underlies this whole story uncomfortably well. Except for the fact that most of the ""Nadsat"" talk was only used partially and most words were changed into the normal English language in order to make it more comprehensible for the majority of people who haven't read the original novel, the story is astonishingly close to the source material. Yet, it is undeniable that it is better to have read the book beforehand, as several small details would easily be misunderstood. For Kubrick, who famously liked to make everything he approached in his signature style, this is quite unusual. As far as I can judge that, this film is by far the most truthful adaption he has ever made. Of course, many things have been compromised and left out (e.g. the complete final chapter) in order to make it shorter, but the basic premise and story are still the same and I recognised most scenes from the book being enacted here. Even if my favourite quote from the book is missing in this adaptation, the ethical debate that was a major element in the novel fortunately wasn't left out here. What makes us human? Is someone who chooses bad better than someone who has the good imposed on him? In what way is it allowed to take away the freedom of choice of a human being? All these aspects are featured, and the correct questions are asked, nevertheless and McDowell leads the viewer through this philosophical journey of social criticism easily. Despite the perversity and nastiness that is a leitmotif in this story, it is easy to follow and always wonderful to look at as a cinematic achievement. The usual Kubrickesque greatness is also shown here, in both cinematography and direction. Most shots are symmetrical and subtly show his eccentric love for detail. He is a perfectionist if there ever was one, and the film benefits from it immensely. All in all, this drama is a wonderfully enacted adaptation of a scandalous novel and does everything right to transfer the scandalousness to the big screen. It is nasty, violent and still oddly philosophical, and was made perfect by the outstanding directorial style of Kubrick and the terrifyingly charming performance of McDowell (which now is in my top ten list of the greatest single performances in cinematic history). Even if some things and motives of the novel are missing, it is still a dazzling adaptation, shocking and brutal, and delivers an odd kind of entertainment. While I wasn't sure about it in the beginning, Kubrick once again amazed me with this feature film. And people say that great stories don't start out with a glass of moloko. This horrorshow sinny is another entry to the list of zammechat adaptations and I admire this achievement deeply. This iconic raskazz brings me a lot of radosty. Kubrick did it once again.",

The four guys who wanted nowhere to vent had robbed, raped, madness and restlessness to form a collection of four evils. The film is so unordered, chaotic streets, and sky-rocketing rooftops. The human-made evil is described undisguisedly. The audience seems to have fallen into the dark and treacherous abyss of hell, facing the death of blue-faced fangs.

He was probably the only filmmaker to establish a way of making movies that no one will ever achieve again, as hard as they try. A proof of that is this movie - which could have probably fallen into the pit of the ridiculous in someone else's hands, but which gets a treatment by a master director and deserves its place among the best movies of all time. This is not an easy one to watch - from the first shot we feel like we're being tested, like the movie is observing us, right from that lunatic stare of Malcolm McDowell's master creation, Alex. The film that follows is something rarely seen afterwards: a depiction of a psychopathic character which starts paying the dividends of his own way of living. Technically the movie is one of the most exquisite items ever put on film: the sets, the framing, the cinematography, all are top-notch. The usage of classical music is also a landmark, as the scenes only make sense with them, and gives some sequences a ballet-like feel that makes them something more than just violence. Altogether, this movie is shocking but for all the right reasons. Guaranteed to make you never forget about it.",

Moreover, we naturally believe that people who do bad things should be punished, and everyone should be a kind person. So much so that I've seen a lot of discussion about the film about whether or not the main character should be punished, and some people think he deserved it even though he was miserable later. I think it's completely beside the point to discuss whether the protagonist is a villain and deserves what he deserves. When watching this film, we don't really care how many evil things the main character does. The director just wants us to understand how miserable a person can be when he loses his free will.",

His film is divisive because he is not afraid to push the envelop, and A Clockwork Orange is more vivid in that regard than any others. From its jaw-dropping opening shot (I was like, ""oh my goodness, this is going to be weird""), the first act went on a mind-boggling journey of sex, violence, and unlawfulness.

Stanley Kubrick and his family got death threats---he had it shelved---and ordered that it never be shown in the U.K. until after his death.(Thats what happened). The story is actually very simple...bad boy commits murder...he is trialled on a new ""cure"" for BAD PEOPLE...one of his victims gets revenge...the ""cure"" doesn't work. Its psycho / sexual Hans Christian Anderson. Goldilocks with vodka and lime & bitters twist. Snow White and the seven erections. There are (of course) very confronting scenes---the rape seen--where the husband is forced to watch. The middle aged fruit cake who gets smashed in the head with a giant penis.

709,25 March 2007,SkullyD,9," Brutal, shocking and ingenious.","I will warn you. ""A Clockwork Orange"" makes no apologies. Its violence is brutal, its nudity graphic. But even more provocative is the fact that the film makes you care about a character who is essentially the villain of the story. Alex DeLarge, played with aplomb by Malcom MacDonald, is a spoiled, heartless, immoral bastard. Alex enjoys making other people suffer. He shows no remorse as he beats and old drunk, rapes a writer's wife or violently bludgeons a woman to death with a ceramic phallus. He seems disappointed in being sent to prison, but never sorry. When Alex undergoes behavioral conditioning is when we really begin to feel sorry for him. He's forced to watch scenes of sex and violence which, thanks to drugs, make him feel sick. He develops a physical aversion to both of his favorite pastimes, but there is no inner change. Alex is released from prison following his treatment and finds that he is no longer welcome. his parents have rented his room to a stranger, his old gang have become police officers who beat and nearly drown him and he is plagued by suicidal thoughts. Eventually, Alex attempts suicide. He lives. To avoid embarrassment, the government undoes his conditioning and bargains with him to keep his mouth shut. In the end, we're left to wonder who the real villain is; Alex, or the system which has spawned him. The film offers no pontification of this question. The viewer must decide; is ""badness"" a choice or an inborn quality? And ultimately the question becomes: Is man basically good or basically evil?",

711,23 July 2014,AniConrad,7, Good But Overrated,This was my first Stanley Kubrik movie and since he is considered as one of the greatest directors ever and a clockwork orange is considered as one of his best movies I had very high expectations. But i have to say I am really disappointed. its not that its a bad movie but its nowhere near great as its accolades suggest. I know some people doesn't like this movie because of its violence but it doesn't really bother me. The main problem with this film is it's screenplay especially the last act which is very lazy screen writing in my opinion. Though the film does have a good theme: free will and psychological conditioning of human mind lack of better screenplay ruins the movie from achieving greatness. On the positive side lead actor Malcolm McDowell has done a great job. The film does have really interesting background music which i liked. Overall its a good movie that you should watch (if you re comfortable with violence) but don't expect it to leave you awestruck.,

Apart from these two I found the film silly, unbelievable, and the main 'theme' (does forcing people to be good actually make them good?) lost to me. Of course, I fear I am in the minority here, but I don't base my opinions on what the majority thinks. I'm going to go out on a limb and say I think Stanley Kubrick was unique, but not a very good director. 2001, Barry Lyndon and Full Metal Jacket are very interesting and different, but not very good.

Although it is difficult to determine whether or not free will exists, it much simpler to analyze on how genuine a person can be, based on their own nature. Stanley Kubrick's dystopia satire plays on this concept of human individuality, pitting itself against a more mechanistic conception of the human being. A Clockwork Orange explores the subjects of morality, political institutions through manipulation, and the initial use of behavioral psychology, in a story that plays out with a chaotic theme of destruction, mixed with comedy.",

Basically a kid who is violent and deranged is caught in a criminal act, and an experimental treatment is applied to 'cure' him of his violence. Like many Kubrick movies, this film is unlike any other. The use of sound/music and the visuals especially are unique. A lot of the props/scenery are incredibly vulgar (even by modern standards) but also artful in a way. The acting is great by the main characters; some of the lesser actors feel a bit tv-movie-ish, but its not too noticeable. I think the least enjoyable part of the movie is also the least enjoyable part of the book; the main character. While Alex is charismatic and active, he's just incredibly unlikeable to me. I get that it's a story about a bad guy, but that just makes for a non-enjoyable experience IMO.

723,18 August 2007,dcldan,9, Impressive movie,"In a new future, the society has gone to an offspring. Alex is a charismatic intelligent guy that loves violence and evilness. He is the leader of a gang and we can see him doing some act of terrific ultra-violence, just for fun. When he is arrested, as he wants to leave prison early, he accepts to be part of a new treatment which will cause him to be a good citizen. This is one of the best Kinrick's movies. Cruel, satiric, intelligent. The fact that ultra-violence is shown to us with lots of ironic and black humour, in almost a hypnotic-oniric way makes it special, then, violence becomes wonderful, and this disturbs you, which is specially the main of the director, he is able to make you love such a disgusting guy. Then, as the violent becomes the Government, Alex is just a victim, a guy that only wants to live quiet, and the ""law"" is the ultra-violent there, programming the prisoners, making them fools that cannot decide freely.",

Also it is not original in the slightest. The story is not original in the slightest. The story steals from many classics of the same nature, that is of a controlling future, and has so much of 1984 in it that I'm surprised it was made in the first place, it's almost a remake. The screenplay is good, the dialogue is sometimes clunky, but the way the scenes are put together is very good. The acting is amazing, Malcolm McDowell and others are fantastic. The direction is good, Kubricks worst direction but not that bad. The visual effects are fair, so much of it looks fake by todays standards, but is so great by the standards of the early seventies. Overrated, but has some great moments, and McDowell gives one of the best performances in film history.",
727,22 October 1998,cukiman,10, Too complex for the average viewer to appreciate it,"I previously thought that the greatest movie of all times was ""Braveheart"", how wrong I was. I had seen ""Clockwork"" before, but I didn't quite understand it, as I was too young to get the point. The movie consists of two halves, the first part is the bizarre, disturbing, ultra-violent, sexual and complex part of a routine day in Alex DeLarge's life. This part is really hard to understand, it is very complex, it has elements like the 5 Jesuses hugged and dancing. This shot alone is enough to write a thesis about it. Then the second part is really what the movie is about, but people seem to remember better the first part and this part is the one that has made this movie an all-time cult classic. The music chosen for the movie is also perfect, I couldn't picture the movie with another song. The casting is perfect, Alex couldn't have been played better than by Malcolm McDowell, with his funny-evil expressions, that give a double meaning to every scene. The best thing of this movie is the story itself, teaching us that we have a choice (this is what the bible is all about), whether to be violent or not, so then they show us what would happen if we weren't violent and Kubrick somehow lets us see that this is not the answer, that we need violence as a choice, really makes you think. But I think this movie isn't pro-violence because it shows you that if you are violent you will eventually get caught or get some kind of payback, so I would define it as pro-choice. When you see this movie you do not get a Hollywood, commercial movie, you get a piece of art, and movie-making today is lacking this. What people call weird I say it's art and that's why this is without a doubt the greatest picture of all time. All of those ""Traispotting"" fans MUST see this movie, because I think that its based on ""A Clockwork Orange"". Amen.",
728,5 July 2018,LewisPritchard,10, The best movie ever made,Clockwork orange is a film about a young man that's interests include rape/ultra violence and Beethoven's 9th.

By far Kubrick best movie and what I consider to be the greatest movie ever made.,

The only problem I find are some performances, it's probably a personal problem, but I can not help but see that several of the performances are uncomfortable, like PR Deltoid, and others that are unintentional, and soulless, like the performances of Alex DeLarge's parents.",

The audience is in such a mood in the movie was the director mercilessly smacked the face.",

One night Alex kills a cat woman with a sculpure and when he is escaping from the police his droogs attack him with a bottle of milk and he is left lying on the ground bleeding for the police to arrest him. When he is sent to jail he signs up for the experiment to  shorten his jail sentence. This will make him sick at the feeling of rape or violence.  They show him videos of rape and violence and hold his eyes open.  They play Beethoven's 9th symphony which also makes him sick when he hears that.  He is released from jail but that's when the real trouble starts!!!",
732,21 October 2001,aracauna,4, I'm not sure why it's so overrated,"I'm not sure how Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" ended up such an overrated movie. It's mind-boggingly juvenile and I could find no apparent reason to justify the constant violence and sex in the movie. The story was weak to begin with and I think it may have gotten its original appeal from the shock value it created. The problem is that 30 years of escalating violence later, the shock value is lost and you end up with a movie that seems more like a half-hearted retelling of the fantasy life of the average geeky adolescent boy. Of course, the movie does have the Kubrick name attached to it so that could also explain some of the hype since so many of his other films were truly excellent. In the end, after all of the hype, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a huge disappointment.",

734,2 April 1999,Cacciato,5, Overrated,"A Clockwork Orange, hailed as one of the greatest films of all time, is nothing more than an attempt to shock the audience.  While I acknowledge the story idea is excellent, it is executed rather poorly by the otherwise flawless Stanley Kubrick.  Moreover, Malcolm McDowell's acting performance is unmoving... I realize I'm watching this sick guy, but I stop caring about midway through the movie.  Don't get me wrong, I am not easily offended. But I do recognize when a movie is simply trying to offend the audience for the sake of offending, as this movie does over and over and over again. It's a movie worth watching because of the brilliant story idea, but don't expect to get anything else out of this movie.",

He and his entourage, eventually, cause so much mayhem that in the process of having fun, Alex murders a woman. On the way out his posse leaves him behind and he goes to jail for murder.

Alex and his three friends rob, rape, torture and murder - for fun. alex is jailed for his vicious crimes and the State undertakes to reform him - but how and at what cost? Clockwork Orange is not only about a man's violent nature and his capacity to choose between good and evil. It is also about the excitements and intoxicating effects of language....a cleverly sustained solo of virtuoso phase-making and jazzy riffs from the book's writer Anthony Burgess. I do not know of any other author who has done as much with language as him here perfectly realized in the film. the fact that this is a very funny film may often pass unnoticed.",

739,14 December 2022,xxxxxdarkmoon,10, I had to watch it twice in order to understand,"I have to admit I hated that movie when I was watching it for the first time. The second time I saw it was a completely different experience. Kubrick did a masterwork about human nature and human society. It is about the clockwork of human youth, the uneducated going terribly wrong, and it is about their actions and motivation behind it. The motivation is boredom and being horny. As sad as it sounds, it is indeed as simple as that. Therefore, programmed like clockwork. Unavoidable. And it is about society's reactions which seem to go terribly wrong as well, precisely like clockwork again. And it is about political hypocrisy and politics that use it for advantage. This is a movie about human nature that is leading to disaster. Precisely like clockwork. I said it before and keep saying it: there is no reason to be proud of being a member of the human race. A species, which is damned to be a failure. A species of selfish, ignorant hypocrites.",

Malcolm McDowell gives a good performance as Alex De Large, a sadistic and violent ruffian who leads his gang of Droogs from one violent episode to the other until he is caught. He is then sent to an institution for a radical treatment to cure him. This is a very stylish and quintessentially English film. The sets are lucid and impressive, the electro music and the classical Beethoven is good, and if you are English you will recognise most of the actors. It is a who's-who of English actors on show. It is a provoking, violent, well-made and memorable film. Essential viewing.",

743,24 December 2011,Artimidor,10," Controversial, essential, brilliantly scored, wonderfully shot - a must-see!","""A Clockwork Orange"" is an ingenious film-makers's masterclass. It's a captivating high-speed ultra-horror tour de force, a raw, grisly plunge into violence, in-out sex, rape and murder, a fall into nothingness, there and back again, accompanied by doom a-knocking with the sound of the Funeral Marsh of Queen Mary. There's also lots of Ludwig van in between in a central role, making ""A Clockwork Orange"" one of the best scored pictures of all time. The topic at hand is a sci-fi tale about gruesome violence based on Anthony Burgess' book, which director Stanley Kubrick made too frighteningly real for some, sugared by the film's aestheticism of violence, critics say he thus embellished despicable acts. This forced Kubrick to retract his own movie in the UK in order to prevent copycats from imitating the film - a circumstance, which of course only contributed to its undisputed cult status. ""A Clockwork Orange"" was a risky undertaking, a film that stirred, shocked, repelled or was loved all for the wrong reasons, but there is no way around it any way you look at it.",

What makes the movie appear so controversial to watch is how the worst crimes committed by Alex and his gang or 'drogues' as he calls them are conveyed. For example, while Alex and his masked companions break and entry into a couples home, the cripple the husband by kicking him in the Dr Martens boots(a fashion icon from this time)while then moving on to cutting the wife's jumpsuit off with scissors while Alex happily sings 'I'm Singing in the Rain'.

After seeing I can see why it caused so much offence, there is a fair deal of nudity and it shows the main character raping women. Until I saw ACO the only movie I had watched of Stanley Kubrick was The Shining but this is in a league of its own.

I think he is a genius since I saw ""Eyes Wide Shut"" this year, so I decided to rent some other celebrated films of him. First, it was ""The Shining"". I thought it was a very scary and impressing horror movie, one of the best things ever made on the genre. After that I saw ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". This one just fascinated me. If I make a top 10 list, I think ""2001"" will be on the top. It is the best sci-fi ever and one of the most beautiful studies about the human beings.

The film is a political parody of how the 3 major political ideologies of the 20th century deal with the concept of evil. The protagonist is not a real person, but the embodiment of the dark side of society (evil). The homeless man on the street represents the old system aka feudalism. The prison sequence explains how fascism deal with evil. The crippled elitist liberal represents communism, who comes close to killing the evil but cannot finish the job. The last scene at the hospital 'democracy' revives the half dead evil, feeding him by his own hands because it benefits his agenda. A similar idea is also explored in Dr.Strangelove's final scene, where crippled fascism gains the strength to walk again. A timeless masterpiece unless you are politically dim.",

Yeah, it's sick. That's the point. But the only flaw is that Kubrick, who is an amazing director, used the American version of the novel rather than the original British version, in which Alex grows up and lives a normal life. But that's still not the point of the movie or the book. It's a commentary on how we have allowed society to become OK with ""ultra-violence."" It's supposed to be about how if we continue down this road we could actually allow 14 y.o. boys (that's what age they were in Burgess's novel) go around raping women and young girls (they were 10 y.o. in the novel) and beating innocent people, doing drugs, etc. I mean if you want to criticize someone let it be the author. Kubrick was just making a wonderful piece of art, and he even toned it down a lot. And yet it still was looked down upon in the country it was written and filmed about. Yet the academy and critics accepted it for what it was. Sure it is disturbing. That's the point. We all watch war movies and think nothing of violence. How is this different? This is fiction. The movie is almost addictive. I have see much worse movies that are hard to watch. Ever seen Funny Games? Now THAT is a messed up movie, much worse than this in my opinion.

Among his classics are ""Paths of glory"", ""2001: a space odyssey"", ""Full metal jacket"", and my personal favorite, ""Dr. Strangelove"".  In all of these movies, you can see the desire that Kubrick has to depict violence as it really is.  Well in ""A clockwork orange"", he depicted it better than any director did in any other movie.  In this true classic, you can see what Kubrick was all about: Showing events as violent as they really are.",

In the case of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, it's juvenile delinquency, government control, and sexual degradation.

785,19 March 2011,BertMacklin_9,10," Beautiful, disturbing, funny, haunting, classic.","Stanely Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is his best work, and one of the best movies ever made. One big ""thing"" about this movie that really makes it a landmark film in history is its content. This movie is really rated 'R'. Explicit sex, rape, and sadistic violence. This doesn't make the movie good, but in the 70's when it was released, it shocked everyone, and was even withdrawn from England. This really shows Stanley Kubrick's fearless directing. So that's a big reason why its known as a landmark film. But as a movie itself, its flawless. Malcom Mcdowell (who should've been nominated for Best Actor when released) gives such a chilling portrayal of a disturbed young man. In the beginning, just the his voice overs give you the chills, and with dialouge, he again is so chilling. Then towards the conclusion, he shows his transformation, and is so vulnerable. Classic performance in film history. Next, Stanley Kubrick's directing is so beautiful, and yet, disturbing. This movie really introduced deep psychological themes, and many movies were not advanced like it at that time in the 70's. Next, Stanley Kubrick is just such an innovative director. His directing gives his movies just such a visual attraction. He just uses so many techniques and made this film so creative and groundbreaking for any movie at that time. This movie has such a great screenplay too, also written by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay has such great narration by Alex. It delivers his madness and thoughts in such a casual way, that that becomes the attitude of the film, and you get comfortable with it. It also has great dialouge. It also is very ""weird"" and not super realistic, but Stanley Kubrick constructs this future society so easily that the dialouge comes so naturally. It also blends a very sadistic form of dark humor. Along with being a sci-fi psychological movie, it also is known as a dark-comedy. And so this makes this screenplay very fresh and smart. So I love this movie. Its definitely one of my favorites. While some older movies can feel kind of out-dated, this movie is just so advanced and really original that it will really always be mentioned as a strong part of movie history. 10 out of 10 stars",
786,14 November 2019,andrewmerritt-31652,10, A great adaptation of the book and the movie,"A Clockwork Orange stars Malcolm McDowell and is directed by Stanley Kubrick. The film revolves around Alex who's favorite hobbies include rape, stealing, and violence. When I first watched this I was shocked by how graphic it was, but I couldn't take my eyes off. And then I watched it again it started to turn into one or my top five favorite movies. I'm a big fan of A Clockwork Orange that I decided to pick up the book as well. And between the book or the movie I choose the movie. I choose the movie because the movie lets the audience decide what Clockwork Orange means to them. But the major difference between the two is the ending because the movie tricks us into thinking is Alex cured or not whereas the book he is cured, but he starts to grow up that in the end feels like a cop-out. I've seen people laugh at this, or look utterly confused because they don't understand the plot and that leaves me with two ideas. To the people who laugh at the movie mean that you either have a twisted sense of humor or there's a little bit of Alex inside all of us. And to the people who are confused with the plot I say watch this again so you have a better understanding of what the plot is trying to show you. And if you can't grasp the plot than you are part of society or refuse to accept of what are society is slowly becoming. And if you don't believe me, Stanley Kubrick and Warner Bros decided to pull this film in the United Kingdom. And it wasn't until Stanley Kubrick's death in 1999, that the studio decided to release it in the United Kingdom. And the end result was that people in Britain consider his a national treasure. But really fascinates me is the complex character Alex who we despise at first because of his violent activities, but later on in the film, we feel sorry for him, that he wasn't such a bad character. So in the end, this movie made my top five movies because this offers such complex and graphic themes that I became hypnotized by it that made me explore films that aren't cookie cutters you see today.",

789,20 May 2016,benatarandres,10, I'm singing in the rain.,"To understand the human being, one has to understand the idea of freewill. Although it is difficult to determine whether or not free will exists, it is much simpler to analyze on how genuine a person can be, based on their own nature. Stanley Kubrick's dystopian satire plays on this concept of human individuality, pitting itself against a more mechanistic conception of the human being. A Clockwork Orange explores the subjects of morality, political institutions through manipulation, and the initial use of behavioral psychology in a story that plays out with a chaotic theme of destruction, mixed with comedy, and somewhat championing a psychotically charismatic protagonist. The young, and difficult to detest Alex (McDowell), our ""loving narrator,"" is both charming and witty in his many loves of life. Be it the beauty of battle among ""Droogs"" of a lesser caliber, his appetite for the ""old in out in out"", or the awe he experiences every time he plays Beethoven's the ninth. Alex, along with his fellow droogs walk the streets of London, beating the poor and further concocting more mayhem to enact on the innocent. After killing a gymnast with an erotic piece of art, Alex is sentenced to 14 years in prison. It doesn't take long for the young hoodlum to acquire even more enemies, be it the conservative prison Chaplin(Quigley) played with an amusing authoritarianism that further strengthens the satirical aspects of the film. After two years of faithfully reading the good book, Alex enlists in a government rehabilitation program with the potential to help him get out quickly. Little to his satisfaction comes the revelation as he faces and reviles at the very violence he once cherished worthy of the grace of God. One grotesque image after another is played out with the ninth in the background, thus deconstructing the very monster Alex is, by no means of himself, for the concept of choice is forsaken for simply greater ethics. It's hard to imagine that there are those who believe that the outcome is more important than the means generated, but as the Minister of the Interior (Sharp) proclaims his change of heart as the cure to evil, Alex's true purpose through the film becomes ever more clear. When first viewing this film, and its brutal rape scenes, accompanied by a jolly tone of wonder, the delusion that Alex merely serves as the role of a sociopath came to mind. As the film progressed however, the manipulation of his nature for political gains became one of the clearer messages within Alex's Cockney rhyming slang. The London society of the film although not completely desolate, is defined by chaos. The streets are filled with rampant gangs of violent sadists, crooked cops, and erotic artwork. Several of the criticisms towards the society in the film, have labeled it a Communist State, just after its failure to stand within the image of socialism. It isn't a far cry of an assumption, as equality appears to be absent within the setting, and it is much easier to see who is in charge. Regardless of who gets to Alex, be it the right wing Minister, with his compassionate generosity, or the self-righteous patriotism of the Anti-Totalitarian left, his place is that of a puppet. Regardless of his nature, or whatever bad luck he stumbles upon, Alex will always find someone to play the puppeteer of his life, never fully grasping the irony of his place in the very society that has robbed him of his right to choose. Although very brash in its approach towards the subject of political manipulation, behavioral psychology, and sexual violence, A Clock Work Orange is a bold, and liberating exercise in filmmaking. Written and Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the film Adaptation of Anthony Burgess' novella is brilliant in its approach of presenting morality within the scope of choice in opposition of psychological abuse. Although the protagonist, Alex is a genuine monster, one cannot completely hate him. Within the first fifteen minutes, he rapes a woman, while singing ""Singing in the Rain"", and yet it is through his rather calm and quaint narrations that he is able to charm his audience into further observing his story, wondering where his path of inner torture will lead him. Malcom McDowell in one of his first screen roles delivers a performance that is both malevolent and ecstatic in its execution. As the leader of his droogs, his pacing along with his patience comes the essence of a wacky and capricious trickster, who sooner tastes the perils of victimhood. Initially we are meant to sympathize with him as he is further thrown down a pit of despair. This same pit carries the many atrocities that he once more acquires, as he utters ""Yes I was cured"", but it all boils down to the true significance of his own purpose as a tool for political power, and not any genuine significance or meaning in his existence other than an addict of destruction and mayhem.",

Being a huge fan of the shining and full metal jacket, I had to check it out. Halfway through the movie I thought it started out strange and I wasn't too sure what to think of it. But as it soon got to the point where Alex the main character was left without his gang members and had to deal with his life on his own, it really became crazy and mind boggling to see everything happen all at once in this story.

795,30 May 2008,sebastian_0728,8, Beethoven???,"i think is important the connection between the violent nature of Alex and Beethoven. But, which may be his reason? I think that perhaps a taste for Beethoven is due to the desire for Alex to preserve his intellectual or classical profile, or perhaps to show through as Beethoven handle his anger. In the music of Beethoven you can see aggressiveness, drama, beauty; perhaps why Alex looked attracted by this music and this music inspired him to commit his acts of violence, either hitting the people or sexually transgress them. Of course he can not be awarded to blame Beethoven by the violent actions of Alex; I also believe that his action was due to their negative attitude towards life and believe that through violence could burn his adrenaline and feel as powerful as he so wished.",

Because, What other thing is prison, death penalty and those kind of corporal punishments but other way of keep and generate much violence in the societies?

I didn't enjoy the first scenes because this type of movies isn't my favorite, but then I understand the principal reason of it, which in my opinion it is a critical observation to government. The first actor was wonderful, he represents to a sick person who likes doing bad things, and he doesn't realize that is wrong. Some scenes are very strong because they show a lot of violence and terrible crime done by a group of teenagers. I think that the family of Alex is a typical family of United States, because they don't mind their son, when he kill the woman and he went to jail, they rented his bedroom to other man and he became like a son to these people. The mother always had a terrible personal aspect, she wore her hair with horrible colors, and the father was a person without character. That government was an excellent example of one in our days where they thought only in its image. They failed when they wanted to correct the Alex's thoughts with their particular methods and the solution was and is always to give money to the victims after they make mistakes. My favorite part of movie was when Alex met with ""his friends"" and they tried to kill him, and also the rest of the scenes when he met with his victims.",

Alex is a young man whose principal interests are rape, ultra-violence and Beethoven. Him and his Droogies go around creating a real horror show. Alex arrested for murder and his Droogies abandoned him. There is a scene where Alex's is reading the Bible and picturing himself doing all bad things that people did in the Bible stories. This would mean the character of Alex is very drawn to violence he enjoys committing it. Would it possibly for someone to become cured so that individual would not commit another act of violence ever again? The rest of the movie will show you if it is possibly. Malcolm McDowell performance as the infamous young troublemaker is fantastic and brilliant. The remix's of Beethoven's ninth symphony are great and work well with the action on the screen.

The movie is about a teenager whose soul passions are Beethoven and ""Ultra violence"". The movie starts off with Alex the main character and his companions in a milk bar. The movie can be divided in 3 parts from this point on. The first part, we are presented with the mischief that Alex and his gang do, like raping a woman and beating up her husband, getting in a gang fight and other nasty stuff. Because of some arguments Alex had with his gang members he got left at a crime scene so the Cops caught him. At this point we proceed with the second part, in which Alex is imprisoned and starts reassessing his life up to this moment. He behaves well and thus is recruited sort of speak for a new experiment that is meant to stop violent behavior. After the terrifying experiment (which involves showing violent images while playing Beethoven's fifth) Alex is unable to commit any violence acts so as a result he is released on parole. This marks the beginning of the third part. After being released Alex returns to his home where he soon learns that things change. He's parents rented out his room, the people who were abused by him get their revenge, and so on and so forth. The last person that gets its revenge is the man whose wife he killed and left him a cripple. The man locks him in a room and plays only Beethoven's fifth symphony which leads to Alex's meltdown and he's attempted suicide. The end of the movie like in all my other revisions I won't give away, you'll have to see it for yourself. So in the end just to summarize ""Clockwork Orange"" is a brilliantly thought out movie about violence, which everyone should see at least once in their life.",

First of all, as I understand it Stanley Kubrick didn't even know that there was 21 chapters in Anthony Burgess' book. For various reasons (some of them conflicting) the American version had only 20 chapters, leaving out Alex's self-determined change for the better. Only in the latest American printing is the 21st chapter included. Anthony Burgess himself said at one point that Kubrick didn't know about it. And the book is excellent as well, by the way, and Burgess does deserve recognition for the book that is his own personal masterpiece, even if he didn't think so. May Kubrick and Burgess *both* be remembered for the definitive thesis on freedom and human nature that is ""A Clockwork Orange.""",

Highly controversial on first release A Clockwork Orange was undoubtedly way ahead of its time and to this day remains an engaging, bold and brilliant satire on the corruption and hypocrisy of a fickle society. At the centre of this, the film remains chillingly topical, demonstrating the debate between free-will versus conformity with a distinct visual approach and creative structure. The best element of this film is the wickedly funny dialogue, a highly inventive take on delinquent orientated slang, but what makes the film a masterpiece is Kubrick's flawless direction. Every scene is beautifully composed and imaginatively stylish, combining zooms, tracking shots, pans and inventive close-ups coupled with some deliriously original editing that pays homage to the class system and engaging pop-art. The film remains a hallmark of modern cinema that is rivetingly brilliant, combining stunning visuals, darkly funny dialogue and insanely catchy music to amazing and accomplished effect.",

It creates the ultimate study of manipulation of mind, which tries to eliminate the deviance, according to the standards of appropriate behavior. The movie starts from the picture of bloody red screen, which illustrates the spirit of that time, when the world was undergone by severe youth riots, Red brigades, who kidnapped famous political leaders, different sabotages and robberies, followed by American war in Vietnam. Besides real life, violence started to be represented in cinematography. Movies used to imply that if violence is the one solution of critical situation, thus, it has to be justified. They used to convince people that brutality is something that people are protected from. A Clockwork Orange, in contrast, proves that everything that occurs around is a result of mutual common action. The movie provides a speculation on the essence of human aggression, freedom of will and adequacy of the punishment. ",
836,1 March 2019,ironcraftleague,8, A beautifully insane movie.,"It's a really good film. Mostly the Alex character makes this film work of course due to him being the main focus and the events he goes through. The opening scenes, only way to describe them, crazy and disturbing. The soundtrack beautifully compliments the movie and makes the pure disturbing nature of this film amplified. However, this movie isn't perfect. There's surprisingly not a lot that stands out after the opening scenes for me atleast. The only thing I can think of is the scene where his friends betrayed him. The pacing can be off aswell. Funny enough, I fell asleep the first time viewing due to the pacing and the story not being all that interesting. I was having a blast with watching the fight in the theater, why didn't we get more of that? Where was the insanity and fun going hand in hand?

839,21 November 2003,terraplane,10," A Tour de Force of cinema, a powerful prediction which came true.","So much has been written about this film, not least on the IMDb, however,a few facts need to be established for the benefit of those who were not around at the time of the original release in 1971. At that time the British newspapers were full of articles condemning the film as a disgusting,depraved,celebration of violence and pornography.The government of the day were being urged to ban the film before civilization as we know it was destroyed.This is not an exaggeration.Much the same thing happened a couple of years later when The Exorcist was released.Of course, none of the so-called guardians of the nations morals had actually seen the film, but they knew enough about it to try to stop the rest of the country having the opportunity to make their own minds up.Which of course is one of the themes of the story.So all this tied in quite well with Kubrick's intentions.He was never in the business of offering answers in any of his works and this is no different.You make your own mind up.The world was a very different place in 1971 and cinema audiences,on the whole, were not so sophisticated as they are now.Or maybe not so blase about sex and violence not having been fed the constant torrent of such material that the modern world takes for granted.But without A Clockwork Orange its very probable that the trail may not have been blazed quite so soon.Whether you think that's a good thing or not is up to you.But at least you have the choice.To correct another common misunderstanding,the movie was never banned anywhere (in the civilised world that is).Kubrick withdrew it from British cinemas within a year because of the way it was misunderstood and misrepresented by the British press.You could, however take a short trip to Paris where it was shown almost constantly.It was only when Kubrick died that his wife decided to allow the film to be re-released in Britain in cinemas and on video that modern audiences got the chance to see for themselves what all the fuss was about.And the general concensus of opinion seemed to be that in comparison to films such as Goodfellas,Taxi Driver,etc, A Clockwork Orange wasn't much to get upset about.The passage of time had dulled peoples senses. But,a lot of what is depicted in the film has since become commonplace.The acceptance of violence,the casual attitude to to casual sex,the alienation and fear of people living in so-called modern housing developments(some of the film was shot in the Thamesmead housing estate in south London which has since become a run down no go area populated by gangs of violent thugs).As to the main thrust of the piece,whether it is right to take away someone's freedom to choose,the jury is still out.You make your decision. This is a great work of cinematic genius.It is unrivalled by any other film, it is unique.If you come to watch it with preconceived ideas you may be disappointed so keep an open mind.When Kubrick was looking for an actor to play Alex he only had one man in mind,Malcolm McDowell.He had seen him in a movie called If...in which he played a rebellious public schoolboy.To this day McDowell has never come close playing another part like Alex,not because he isn't a good actor,but because,quite simply there is not another part like Alexander De Large.This is a 10/10 movie.See it and watch a masterpiece.",

Stanley Kubrick was at the height of his creative prowess when he directed his triumphant 1971 film 'A Clockwork Orange', based off of the dystopian novella by Anthony Burgess in 1962. The story takes place in a futuristic Britain, where crimes are rampant and there is very little that can actually be done about it. Our main protagonist/villain is a young delinquent named Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) who is the leader of his gang of Droogs. The main interests of Alex is rape, committing ""ultraviolent"" acts after consuming drug-infused milk and listening to Beethoven. It is only when he accidentally kills a cat lady off with a phallic sculpture when attempting to burglarize her home that he is imprisoned and brainwashed into a descent citizen, via the Ludovico Technique, so that the mere thoughts of violence and sex nauseate him. In the end, he resorts to his former self after he attempts suicide and the government try to ""fix"" him again. ",

Next Kubrick show us how this particular simple boy will manage his life when government take away one of the trait of humans - to be violent. And I think that's where we can see genius of Kubrick: he show us as Alex live and survive all things that he did in past. Kubrick show us how vulnerable was all that people that suffered Alex outrages.
At final Kubrick through Alex's suicide attempt show us, how it is hard and unmanageable his life became after Ludovico treatment. How 'unable to response' to death threats almost break his life.",
843,3 May 2010,The_Stuff_of_Dreams,10, How could you call this boring?,"The one thing I do not like about A Clockwork Orange is how it reminds me how desensitized I am to violence. I should be horrified by what happens on the screen, I should turn away in disgust, but I do not. So, by principle, I will not allow this film to be called ""boring."" Do not misinterpret me; I legitimately enjoyed this movie. It is visually and audibly thrilling. Its surreality gives it a unique element rather than a weird flavor that leaves the viewer feeling confused and unsatisfied. Stanley Kubrick is a master at emotionally manipulating the viewer, and Malcolm McDowell knows how to bring Alex DeLarge to life on the screen and in the audience's world. Expect the unexpected with this film; I thought, for instance, that there would be know plot (which there was) and I thought the violence would be unbearable (which, with spiritual misfortune, is not), and I thought that I would hate Alex for what he does (I feel the opposite). Perhaps it is easier to understand if the viewer knows what was going on in England at the time the film was made (a near state of anarchy). Perhaps it is just one of those films that has to be seen. Do not read the reviews or the synopses or articles; just watch it, and see what happens. There is little else that can be effectively done with A Clockwork Orange.",

845,21 July 2016,tczech9,10, Artistic and Satirically Unmatched,"Oh, my little brothers, this film was an artistically wild ride. From start to finish, this tale of a dystopian British future was continually shocking and left the hairs on its audience's chins erected full-fold in utter disturbance and disbelief. The opening scene pictures a group of four 'droogs': Alex, their leader; Georgie, Alex's subsequent adversary; Dim, a beetle-brained follower; Pete, a silent disciple of whoever his superior happens to be conveniently. The droogs relax at a sexually obscene milk bar where they drink substance- laced dairy and discuss how they fancy to spend their evenings, usually boiling their decisions down to some form of ""ultra-violence."" Whether it involves rape, assault, or simply vandalism, the teenage hoodlums embark on quests to please themselves at any cost and commit any heinous crime regardless of the consequences they ensue. Despite receiving death threats and warrants on his and his family's lives, Stanley Kubrick decided to allow American theaters to air ""A Clockwork Orange."" Due to its constant explicit material and violent spurts of rape and murder, this movie garnered fear in the UK's citizens and eventually, and rightfully so, received the rare 'X' rating, a step above 'R,' from the MPAA. What many fail to understand, possibly because of the undeviating sadism in the film, is the subliminal message and satirical undertone that it entails. Many people choose to interpret the themes of this movie differently. Personally, I like to use a quote from one of Kubrick's later films, ""Full Metal Jacket,"" to help understand the concept of experimentation in coherence with Alex's character throughout the film. In FMJ, Private Joker, played by Matthew Modine, wears a button engraved with a peace sign, contrasting his helmet which reads ""born to kill."" When asked why he wears two accessories with opposite messages, he replies ""I think I was trying to suggest something about the duality of man, sir."" What Joker is trying to portray is how man can be both good and evil, yet as we see the events in FMJ unfold, we see how one side often times may outweigh the other. As I was watching ""A Clockwork Orange,"" I noticed a similar character path in Alex. While in FMJ the dividing line was the Vietnam conflict, the authoritarian experimental government examined in A Clockwork Orange plays the same role. After undergoing treatment for his criminal, epidemic behavior, Alex no longer has the choice to perform acts of evil, and that inevitably brings into question freedom of choice. However, as the film progresses, Alex continues his will to act out, even though he physically cannot carry out his wish. Eventually, he attempts suicide and the final scene of the movie depicts him amiably flirting with the very government that took away his freedom in the first place, all while having rugged sexual intercourse in his mind. What this proves is how the root of each human being will prevail, in spite of any attempts, whether personal or otherwise, to alter the soul. Being an early 70's film, this theme was created in such a bizarre, repugnantly imaginative manner that it achieved its goal to prove that society and humanity have unsolvable issues using a fascinating futuristic contrast. Final decision: 10/10.",

I think that this is the second best movie made by Kubrik - ""Full Metal Jacket"" being number one. There is an other thing about this movie I'd like to point out and that is the music that is used.

Watching it is kind of like having a surreal dream but one you wake up remembering. Malcolm Mcdowell is cast perfectly as Alex, the leader of a group of violent punks who both admire him and are afraid of him. Alex is chosen to participate in an experiment that will cure him of his violent behavior by brainwashing him to be a proper citizen. He is forced to watch hour after hour of violence on a movie screen until just the pure thought of violence makes him want to vomit. There's more to the experiment then that but that's the gist of it. The group of punks even have their own language that they speak to each other but not so obscure that the audience can't grasp it. When the controversial film was released, it sparked much violence in England where a few too many audience members were inspired by Alex and his gang of punks. The director, Stanley Kubrick, forbid the movie playing there again to his dying day. You'll never think of the song ""singing in the rain"" in the same way again and you'll see why. Let's hope the day doesn't come when this movie isn't made into a lame remake starring Leonardo Decaprio. GOOD STUFF!",

McDowell does a very convincing job by playing a scumbag of society. I dont think anything is as good as the moral of the whole movie. In fact the moral of the movie is what really makes the movie other than the master art of Kubrick. Dialogue is good as of any of Kubrick's movie but can be somewhat lenghty on some scenes. I would have to say this is one of the strangest movies ive ever seen but it did somewhat make sense to me. I gave it an 8 for cinematography, lighting, dialogue, very original story line, and great role played by McDowell. I cant say i recommend this movie to any movie lover.

But enough of the book. The movie contained much of the original speeches from within the book. (Word of warning! The movie's words are extremely difficult to understand, because they are made up words mixed with real words. IE-- Glazzies--eyes, Horrorshow--""good"", droogs--friends)",

It was definitely one of my favourites, although it was hard to read(mainly due to Russian slang). The point was, should we take away abuser's and criminal's free will in order to reduce violence and crimes? Since I read it, I was eager to watch the film. The movie literally follows the book, showing young Alex's criminal adventures and his way of living life without conscience, even using the same slang as in the book. Watcher shouldn't have any trouble following the movie's story. I was fascinated how the poor man (who's wife has been raped by Alex and his gang) was realistically presented, with all his anger and revenge waiting for the right moment to destroy Alex. This movie points out from every other movie I've watched, it has unpretentious and specific story that has never been covered before and that is why it should be watched. Now, why did I mention you shouldn't watch it if you read the book first? In my case, I imagined the plot happening somewhere in godforsaken parts of London, or some big English city, in 70's or 80's. I believe it's mentioned somewhere in the book that plot takes place around that time. I did not imagine Alex, his gang and parents, and some other people wearing futuristic suits looking like they popped out from year 2100. And his mom having pink hair? I don't think so. People living in newest modern architecture houses and buildings, when it's actually year seventy-something? I really don't think so.

However, most importantly, the character and story are genius. Alex, from the description of him being a snobby, violent, delinquent murderer hoodlum, sounds like a despicable character. But like all good movies starring anti-heroes, the movie just dares us to forget morals and like him. Because it is truly impossible not to like him. Despite the fact that he is a violent murderer, he is one of the coolest characters in movies. The plot is fairly simple.

(especially warren clarke in the underrated role of dim). this is also probably the most faithful adaption of a book ever brought to screen. the camera work is amazing throughout the film, especially in the sequence in alex's room. not only that, this movie is so amazing on all levels that it even achieves the feat of perverting what may the most harmless tune of ""singing in the rain."" there is so much in every frame of the movie that mutliple viewings are required just to catch all of kubrick's little subtleties. so brilliant in fact, that no one else could have made this film. this is one of only a handful of movies that deserves a bi-weekly viewing and like any true classic, this movie will never go out of style.",

Stanley Kubrick(2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut) brings to life Anthony Burgess's dystopian novel in which a teenage boy named Alex and his gang go around terrrorizing(assault, rape) innocent people for fun. Alex is caught after an accidental murder and sent to prison and is put through a rehabilitation program which makes him sick whenever he has thoughts of violence and sex. There were times when I cringed and turned away. The rape scenes made me want to vomit, but most of the disturbing parts take place within the first hour. After that the rest of the movie isn't that bad. What surprised me about the movie is it's underlying tone of comedy. There are a few parts that are actually really funny. The acting is top notch especially Malcolm McDowell. His character, Alex has to be one of the scariest main character/villains of all time. After seeing what he does you kind of want to see him pay the price for his actions. While I was watching the movie Alex reminded me of Eric Cartman from South Park.

It seemed more like fun than lust And some ""ultra violence"" that turned out to be, it was nothing.

I just watch this movie because I had heard a lot about it, like one of the best movies and also because I found ""A Space Odyssey"" an amazing movie, surprising, different, unique. So I gave it a try and I must say I do not regret it. Although this isn't a new movie, with all the special effects that we are presented nowadays, the plot is great, it's very fresh, different from what I'm used to see and for me that is always awesome. Another fantastic thing about this movie it's the soundtrack. It's amazing how Beethoven can transform a horribly violent scene into something still violent but classy (not that violence becomes acceptable, but the scenes don't get vulgar, trashy and for someone like me, who isn't a fan of violent movies, that is quite good). Then there's Alex, which for me is one of the most charismatic characters I've ever seen. He has no sense, no good, he's evil, a psychopath, but a very unique one. The performance of Malcolm McDowell is simply amazing! So if you like movies about crime, violence but with some message, some lesson about society and with a classy touch this is very indicated. It doesn't get boring and you realize that society didn't change so much since the time the movie was made: we still search for the best way to threat a criminal and the cynicism from our minister to just look good no matter what it's still there too.

There's no far out futuristic and improbable new world, just the same one we have today with new drugs, but the same problems. The amazing creation here is not a dazzling vision of the future, but the insight into a mind that has moved light-years from what we consider socially acceptable and is at the same time likeable and sympathetic, regardless of his visciousness and lack of a conscience. He's not even aware that such a thing exists, let alone how it could possibly benefit him to have one. The moral question posed here, however, is how far can society stretch its morals in order to impose bureaucratic enforced standards on the masses. The characters are well rounded and there are some truly memorable scenes. I can still speak much of Alex's pseudo Russian-English dialect even after 27 years. Now that's a movie that has an effect on you. I recommend that all you starry-eyed vetches viddy the book.",

Partially it was my uncertainty to what I was told was in the film that kept me away. What I now find myself asking is, ""Why didn't I see this sooner?"" It didn't hurt that the actor portraying Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is quite an attractive & talented man. The story hit upon things that make sense to me, the love of music being one aspect (the inclusion of classical, though played with synthesizers, was befitting for the overall feel of the film). I can sort of understand the character of Alex acting the way he does, and how he was treated upon his release back into society. I personally had no problems with the playful aspect of the William Tell Overture scene, even the cheeky foreplay at the music store (which was the Chelsea Drug Store). However unwanted the violation & violence are, they are necessary to the storyline. I adore the satire, and understand what Stanley Kubrick was shining the spotlight on: how twisted society is, and how normal we believe we are. -Monday, 22 October, 2007-",

May be it has become a common thing nowadays so I am not feeling for the time it was made.

After I watched it a couple more times and did some research, I realized what a great film it is. First off it is a really great adaptation of the book which is written in a thick British dialect so it is extremely hard to understand. The story takes the unruliness of adolescent boys and how to deal with them. The film is shot really well. There are a lot of dark shots and contrast is used really well.

Watch it loud, watch it alone, watch it in sheer awe. Unfortunately for me, I had only rented it, and had to work each day, but each chance I had, I did this very thing.

Of course nearly all the credit for that goes to Anthony Burgess, the writer of the novel. However, focusing on the adaptation of the book, this movie is one of the best movies in cinematic history. The casting of Malcolm McDowell as Alex was one of the best decisions made by Stanley Kubrick. He embodied that role so exceptionally and I can't see anyone that could have done it better than him. He performed all the characteristics so well, especially since Alex basically changed personalities three times throughout the film. The film itself is so well made, it lives up to the book and maybe even better. It's the only book adaptation I accept. The best part about the film for me is the narration. The way Alex talks to the audience makes the movie inclusive, which captures and helps maintain the attention of the audience. Malcolm McDowell did a terrific job at the narrations. You could not see his face but his voice alone could show how menacing Alex really is. The narrations and McDowell's tone and voice is what made people root for and sympathize with Alex despite his questionable actions. I love Stanley Kubrick for not shying away from the nadsat slang, used in the books, and actually used it religiously throughout the film. Its futuristic aesthetic is so well portrayed, everything looks so innovative yet there's still a hint of vintage. It is baffling how this movie did not win an Academy Award (that I still strongly believe was an attempt of avoiding controversial gossip from the public). No matter how controversial it is, A Clockwork Orange is still a cult movie which explains a lot about how good it is.",

Set in the future Britain where 16 year old Alex is jailed after one his raped victims die, he volunteers for an experiment designed by the government in an effort to solve the crime problems of the society. To begin with, I must admit, A Clockwork Orange is undoubtedly one of the most artistic pieces of cinema I have seen in a long, long time. The character of ""Alex"" (played brilliantly by Malcolm McDowell) is pure evil, sending shivers down your spine. Everything about him is so evil, so dark. The movie, which looks more like a stage-play version and less like a movie is enthralling, especially the conversations between Alex and his partners. The movie is disgusting, dark, sinister, gross, violent and very very artistic. The power of the movie is that it stays for hours after it has ended. In fact, this is one of the reasons why it took me a day and a half before I got down to review this movie, those disturbing images stick with you in your head...

His portrayal of the hoodlum Alexander DeLarge (a young man whose principle interests are rap, ultraviolence, and Beethoven) is both powerful and disturbing.  Simple minded Congresspersons and civil servants would like to no doubt blame the sick sad world we live in on films such as these; when in fact films like this are the magnifying glass through which society's ills are exposed to harsh light.  Alex's own corrections officer is confounded - he has a good home, two parents, something of a brain on his head - why is he such a terror?  There's no easy answer; and that rings just as true when you ask why Columbine High or why Oklahoma City.  There's no one source, no one reason, and sometimes bad actions really can't be quantified.

It connects this portrayal to a cruel glimpse into an Orwellian totalitarian government, which combats this same infection of crime with a brutal, gut-wrenching psychological treatments.

Alex is caught, convicted, and undergoes an experimental ""cure"" at the hands of the government that changes who he is. The film doesn't glorify or renounce violence, it shows it very matter of factly. Kubrick instead forces you to look at the criminal's role in society, and the ideas of free will, and individual rights versus overall benefit to society. The film starts out very fast and slows down as the story develops. This film takes many strange twists and turns, and although it wasn't something I enjoyed, Kubrick did a wonderful job of telling this strange story, and the movie will stick in your head long after you see it.

The way a movie would be done, what the lesson of a movie is, and how much art does it have in it? Nobody knowes how Kubrick adapted such a brilliant thing, nobody knowes how it showed this result. I've read the book, it's tremendous as a book, but even better as a movie. It changed the way the audience looks at a character, and as funny as it is it changed the song forever Singing In The Rain. Most films are hard to see a change in a person, but I could see the change easily. Malcolm MckDowell does such a great job showing the change of the character, happy, sad, happy, he does a great job of showing this criminals whole life. The script does a great job doing that to. Kubrick made this film a mark on cinema forever, believe me this isn't the only film of his that changed cinema, but this is the movie of Kubricks that changed cinema the most. 10/10 rating, go see this once you get the chance, maybe disturbing, and if it is the first time, see it a second time, it's better.",

970,6 May 2003,stedrazed,10, Quite possibly the greatest film of all time.,"Words cannot describe the genius that is Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE; it must be seen. In fact, it must be seen over and over again, and compared to Anthony Burgess's equally brilliant novel, and then seen a few more times for good measure. Malcolm McDowell is utterly impeccable as Alexander DeLarge (get it?), a name in keeping with the sly pun names of Kubrick's DOCTOR STRANGELOVE. For those of you who haven't seen it (shame on you), I will briefly explain the title, and no more; YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM!!!!!! A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, in the novel, is actually the title of a book being written by an old man whom Alex and his ""droogies"" (""that is Pete, Georgie and Dim"") attack, beat and rob one night. The idea is that when a man loses his free will to the justice system, through punishment and so-called ""rehabilitation"", he becomes as a clockwork orange: flesh and the semblance of life on the outside, but all mechanical gears on the inside. That should give you some indication of what happens to Alex, but not too much. Remember, you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; the greatest who ever lived, in my opinion. The complexity of the symbolism, the beauty of the decor, the intricate three-act structure, the uniquely dark humor and comedically melodramatic pathos ---- there's simply no other film like it. Nor will there ever be. I consider 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY to be the greatest achievement ever made in the cinema, but for sheer viewing pleasure, this is my favorite film. See it at all costs; then see it again.",

A Clockwork Orange qualifies as my favorite. If you have never watched this film, please do yourself a favor and take the time to do so; it is a highly rewarding experience. I won't go into a summary of the plot or the meaning behind any of it all because that has all been discussed at length here by other reviewers. I will simply write that it is impossible to overstate how truly remarkable and unique this film is, and how simply genius the vision and talent of Stanley Kubrick was with regards to A Clockwork Orange. This has been my favorite film since I first saw it about twenty-two years ago. I certainly enjoy and appreciate other films, though no other work in the medium of film has even come close to approaching this film, in my opinion, as the best example of the medium as an art form. (How very fitting that Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the best piece of music ever written, features prominently in this film. A marriage made in Heaven!) Though usually classified in the genre 'science fiction,' this film genuinely defies categorization, so universal is its scope. Every moment of it is poetry. A priceless film and one of humanity's crowning achievements. I'd give it 100 stars out of 10 if that were mathematically possible.",

One of Stanley Kubrick's greatest films, and certainly one of cinema's greatest films. It is the story of a pretty disturbed young man named Alex DeLarge, who enjoys ultraviolence, sex, gang rape...and Ludwig Van Beethoven. He spends most of his time hanging out with his cronies, who are all disturbed themselves. Each night they decide to have some fun, so they will either resort to a violent beating, rape (As Alex puts it, ""The Ole' In-Out, In-Out""), or both. They hang out at a bar, where spiked milk comes out of the nipples of naked female statues. One night, while Alex and his friends are wreaking havoc, Alex murders an old woman, and is sent to prison. Doctors decide to test a new formula on him, one which will cure him of his horrid habits. They inject him with a syrum, tie him to a chair with a straightjacket, prop his eyelids open with a clamping device, and expose him to horribly violent and sexual films. All of a sudden, he starts to feel a little queasy. His eyes are forced open, so he can't close them. The screen is too big for him to look away, so he has no choice but to watch these graphic films and get sick. Now that violence and sex nauseate Alex, he is released from prison...but when he attempts to kill himself, the government is blamed for what they did to him, and in the end, he is completely cured; violence and sex are again part of his life. This is definitely one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, but there is something about it that draws you into it and makes you want to watch it.

The treatment (which, I've heard, damaged McDowell's cornea) is scary - my girlfriend couldn't watch. The music intertwines beautifully with it all, and the attempted suicide scene makes you feel the crunch of bone on ground. The ending also makes you think: has he changed at all?

At the same time, it is also an intense, meticulously crafted, creative masterpiece.  It is difficult to admit in our society that this film is a masterpiece because it's main character, a psychotic criminal that routinely exercises in rape, violence and Beethoven, can encounter injustice from a social group that we support and trust... government.  Although 'Alex' (the main character) perform disturbing criminal acts, what the government did to him in this film was worse.  It is extremely difficult to watch, yet it contains the film makers' brilliant observation of society. It is a film that demands to be seen (several times to be near-completely understood).

Master director Stanley Kubrick is at his height of creativity here, both in terms of visual style and storytelling. The original source material is a great novel, and though someone else's version might've looked different, and therefore looked more like what is described in the book, the story is otherwise quite faithful here. The film has everything: Action, comedy, sex, violence, prison drama, and Beethoven. What more could a person ask for? Though Kubrick directed other classic films, like The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Paths of Glory, this is undoubtedly his finest hour. A Clockwork Orange is one of the most original films in existence. Like it or not, you'll never forget it... **** out of ****",

994,9 May 2006,LuckyGraveyardBoots,9, ultra-violence sickens on both sides of the screen,"This film is a very heavy-handed dissection of morality and the many forms hypocrisy can take. It's very, very shocking even now, and even more so for its time (when it was nominated for a Best Picture many Hollywood heavyweights refused to even show for the ceremony), and Stanley Kubrick's stale, disgusting vision of the future still strikes a specific, hidden nerve. It tells the story of Alex, a juvenile delinquent who adores violence and rape of all kinds. When he is imprisoned for murder, he becomes a test subject for a new form of torture that is supposed to ""reform"" criminals of violent behaviours by associating images of violence, blood and rape with severe physical sickness. After two weeks, Alex emerges spineless and brainwashed, and considerably less menacing - a clockwork 'orange'; that is, orangutan - symbolic of his weak facade to try and fit into society once more. After this point, it's very hard to watch, because once Alex is released back in his tiny world, he learns there really is no forgiveness of any kind. What's funny throughout is that the violence of Alex and his companions pales in comparison to the violence exerted on them by the government and their world in general - for example, a regular bar is filled with horrifying pornographic images, wholly unnecessary measures and cruelty are used during the treatment...and perhaps most troubling of all is that Alex's former companions, upon his 'reform', have since become part of the police force. There really is no right or wrong. By the end we realize that what we thought was terrible at the beginning doesn't really mean anything. And what's scary is that the lonely world of A Clockwork Orange really isn't too different from our own. From a debate about whether the treatment is 'right' because it doesn't really change desires to harm, it progresses to a point where the actual reform of a human being seems impossible - there's no way how or why somebody would want to change. Even when the possibility of something other than 'an eye for an eye' is introduced, it turns out to be functionally impossible. Both the film-making and the acting are heavily stylized, cloying, and somewhat difficult to watch - all this works well with the intended effect of the film. Malcolm McDowell pulled off a difficult role reasonably well, but he's not too great. The rest of the characters stick in your head in a distinctly Fellini-esquire manner, which makes for a memorable storyline. The themes of regression vs. progression are toyed with in a way that really makes you think about the 'progress' we've supposedly gone through in the past century or so. One faintly amusing thing - I noticed the violence depicted here actually made me sick - exactly like Alex's treatment. Not accidental.",

It's interesting how he used local places to create his 1984 style world, instead of building elaborate sets. This film sucks you in at the first frame with its synth score and awesome visuals. Everu time I watch this movie it gets better and better. I find it odd that it was banned in the UK during its original release, because though disturbing, it really isn't that graphic compared to movies like Hostel and Saw.

1006,1 January 2005,Ndirsch11,10, The Greatest Film Ever Made!,"What Stanley Kubrick accomplishes with A Clockwork Orange is simply beyond words. This film is number 1 on my favorite film list for an infinite number of reasons. First of all, the acting, screenplay, and direction are all top notch; the story is ambitious and brave; the film's use of classical music fits perfectly; and it leaves you with so much to think about. The key to the film's brilliance lies in its humor. The film contains extraordinarily dark subject matter yet seems lighthearted all the way through. I can't help but watch this film with a smile on my face because I know and understand that the film is trying to poke fun at society and the hypocrisy within our various institutions. That's what all great satire does and this is the greatest satire of them all. Notice such scenes as the nurse and the doctor having sex while Alex is waking up in the hospital, the cat lady with her obscene paintings and statues, the naive parents who don't suspect that their son is up to no good when he goes out at night. All of these things highlight the fact that ordinary, everyday people act much differently behind closed doors than they do in public. In fact, I believe that one of the main messages of the film is that we all in a sense have elements of Alex DeLarge's personality within our own personality. When we can't even acknowledge our own barbaric and disgusting drives then how can we even begin to think of solving such social problems as murder and rape? Many people make the mistake in thinking that the film is trying to justify Alex's crimes. Alex is not meant to be looked upon as a hero or a role model. He's a villain all the way through. But one must also notice how villainous all the other characters are too. Everyone in this movie is essentially a villain because they are all human, and subject to the same drives that drive Alex and his droogs to murder and rape out of boredom. The reason why I believe Stanley Kubrick to be the greatest director who ever lived and ever will live is his ability to depend on the audience's intelligence. All of his films are deliberately ambiguous because the audience is supposed to come to its own conclusions. What you put into a film is what you take away from it. Stanley Kubrick will be missed.

1008,15 July 2009,Roach_91,10, Man Does Not Naturally Run Like Clockwork,"A Clockwork Orange is a movie based on Anthony Burgess's novel of the same title. To many, it is considered a fantastic work of art and Stanley Kubrick(director) at his finest. It tells the tale, in the first person, of a young lad named Alex deLarge(Malcolm McDowell). This young man is about fifteen years old and is a fan and avid participant of ultra-violence, which is an unprovoked act of violence purely for the entertainment of himself and his ""droogs."" Droog is a word that transposes to friend in their slang they use called ""nadsat."" These acts of ultra-violence are quite brutal, but are contrasted against classical scores, such as Beethoven, which disturbingly make them seem almost comical. We follow Alex through his life committing these acts and living highly until he is set up by his droogs one night, arrested for murder, and sent to a detention center. There, he becomes part of a program that makes him physically sick to hurt anyone. After he finishes the program, he is considered cured and released. He returns home to find that his parents don't want him and is put out on the streets. He encounters almost everyone he had wronged, including his former droogs, who all seek their revenge. He returns to one of his victims' house, who recognizes him and locks him upstairs, driving him mad with music until he can no longer take it and attempts suicide by jumping out of the window. He survives and receives medical attention, including a surgery that ""cures"" him from his pains. The government is blamed for his suicide attempt, claiming the program and his treatment to cure him was inhumane. They make a deal, give him a job, and take care of him. This movie does an incredible job at making the audience sympathize with the narrator, and almost making light of terrible acts of violence. It's hard to decide if it is he, or the government who is the hero or the villain.",
1009,2 June 2006,RenaissanceMan42,10," Kubrick's Masterpiece is a Genuinely Unique, Sensational, and Brilliant Work of Art","What I personally admire most about Stanley Kubrick, and about his work in his master opus A Clockwork Orange especially, is the extent to which the film maker completely disregards the cliché, invariable Hollywood motifs that are present in and ruin so many potentially enjoyable films: there is no obligatory Hollywood love story in this film; there is positively no regard for normal Hollywood decency standards, especially of the time; there is no effort made to minimalize the esoteric language used by Alex and his droogs, despite the fact that only an individual with a moderate grasp on Russian could understand the nature of the speech; and there are, as far as I have noticed, no concessions made to the mainstream, whatsoever. Kubrick relates Anthony Burgess's story in a manner arguably considerably more effective, if not just completely better, than that of the novel. Set to an absolutely glorious soundtrack, featuring Rossini, Elgar, Beethoven, and other great giants of classical music; featuring fight scenes that are so ingeniously choreographed as to be amusing as well as visually stimulating; featuring the signature camera work of Kubrick himself; featuring 'futuristic' art and other eye candy, Clockwork Orange in film form is Burgess's vision brought to life. To glorious, brilliant life. The story of the film is unique in that it combines relative simplicity and sheer genius. As the film focuses on the escapades on the young Alexander De Large (a play on words from a scene in the book that Burgess fans will remember smilingly, as Alex refers to himself as 'The Large'; no last name is actually ever given in the book) and his fortunes, the audience is able to observe in one character, many characters. First there is the revel-rousing, obviously clinically insane Alex, the leader of a gang of vicious young criminals; then, there is the scheming institutionalized Alex, who wants nothing more than to get out of prison; then there is the Alex who is a puppet of society after his treatment; and then there is Alex the victim, the treatment having gone terribly wrong. And, in the end, there is the same old Alex, the criminal, indicated subtly so to the audience in the triumphant final scene of the film when he utters a pair of lines identical to those he had spoken earlier in the film. In the end, Kubrick's Clockwork Orange is a masterpiece. It is a psychological analysis, and it is social satire; it is a showcase for beautiful music and beautiful language; it is an amusing spectacle of dark humour and sly jocularity; is a bizarre, chilling dystopian tale; and it is, very possibly, the most enjoyable film ever produced. And this can largely be contributed to Kubrick's disregard for the Hollywood mainstream. This film is as good and important to people as it is for films, as well. If you are human, and if you enjoy a good film, then Clockwork Orange will suit you just fine. Even if you've fallen desperately dependent upon the sort of mainstream nonsense that Hollywood pumps out today. Indeed, if that is your situation, you will find Kubrick's Clockwork Orange a breath of fresh air, and you will find yourself desperately desiring more films like it. Sadly, there are so few. Wnjoy this film, then, for what it's worth: a great film for the sake of being a great film. And it is truly that, if nothing else. A great film.",

Kubrick has the essence of ""expressionism"". He is good at expressing the characters' psychological activities outwardly through a group of lenses that peer into the inner world of the protagonist, which is an important feature of expressionism.

(I was too young for that sort of movie when it came out but, fortunately--by my teen-age years--it had ascended to the status of ""cult classic"" and ran ubiquitously in the Greenwich Village ""art theaters."") Alex leads a gang that gets drugged out at the local ""milk bar"" and then indulges in orgies of violence, rape, and, eventually, murder. The Beethoven fascination that others have mentioned is, frankly, a relatively minor plot component: Alex is a big-time fan of the ""Glorious Ninth"" and enjoys playing it while ""playing doctor"" with girls he's picked up at the local record store. (Odd how, in 1971, the vision of a ""future society"" still included LP records, a technology we did away with decades ago--even though a CD is less flexible: you can't play your favorite part of your favorite song, and you can't play it at 45 to raise its frequency by four steps.) After murdering an old lady (""and me still only fifteen,"" Alex quasi-guiltily monologues to us), Alex is spirited off to a jail where he is treated to the experimental ""Ludovico Technique"" for curing violent offenders by forcefully subjecting them--eyes maintained open with surgical clamps, ears inobstructible--to non-stop barrages of extreme torture, rape, murder, etc. But Alex isn't exactly cured, and, after his return and ""reintegration"" into society, the movie--quite honestly--spirals downward in pace, consistency, texture, and, frankly, excitement. The end result is that Alex is still Alex, still a rapist, still a murderer, and still ""triggered"" whenever he hears Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" (a choral section of the Ninth Symphony).",
1016,5 July 2005,bryan_nixon79,10, Stanley Kubrik's masterpiece works like clockwork,"A Clockwork Orange is one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. It is my favorite film by Stanley Kubrik, who I believe, along with Martin Scorsese, is the greatest director ever. Full Metal Jacket, The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut, 2001, and Dr. Strangelove are some of the best of all time, for me anyway. I wish that Kubrik could have had the opportunity to direct Artificial Intelligence, but Spielberg's homage did just fine. Back to A Clockwork Orange. This film is painful to watch on many levels. It is violent, but that is the subject matter. Due to that, this film is not for everyone. The soundtrack adds so much depth. The opening shot is planted in my brain, which is a closeup of Alex's face in the milk bar that features eerie music that fits so wonderfully. I do not want to describe the plot, because many others have and I do not want to give anything away. I do, however, want to write about my interpretation of the scene in which Alex is being ""treated"" in the movie theater by scientists who are trying to forcefully remove the evil from within his mind and heart. In the scene, they strap Alex down in a chair and hold his eyes open, so that he can not blink or look away from the screen. While he is strapped down, he watches footage of violence, rape, and war. In a way, this scene describes what the movie does to the viewer. When watching this film, it is impossible to look away, no matter how far it goes. The violence is not stylish or exciting. Instead, it is painful, brutal, hateful, and violent. Kubrik made this film to turn audiences off by violence. In today's world, violence seems to be the key to the success of a film. Just look at The Matrix or Kill Bill (I love both of these films by the way). I believe that Kubrik's mission was the same as the scientists, which was to scare the evil out of you. At least, that is what the film did to me. You know what I'm saying? If you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend it. Art does not get much better than this. It's a shame that the movie is loved by younger audiences due to the fact that they find the violence to be hilarious. They have it all wrong.",

But what I VERY much like in this movie is the message deliverd : The hypocrism of the government,and how the only crimes tolerated are theirs. (What I also liked was the way they used skinner's theory of conditionning) So in the end...You either like it or hate it(for the violence,although in a very estatic kind of way,and the fact that it is rather tacky and disguisting at times).

Being a Kubrick film the cinematography is second to none, even if the synthesizers and set pieces feel very 70's today.

1031,15 December 2004,ci03mak,8, A Classical Masterpiece,"A Clockwork Orange is no doubt a classical masterpiece which artistically employs themes such as good vs evil and free will vs indoctrination, followed by presenting them in a very dark manner, which may seem surreal to some, artistic to others and if you are like me, both. The aforementioned themes are presented in a dark manner because whilst presenting them in the movie, kubrick has made abundance use of coupling violence with sex, and has exploited several immoral ways to bring some fundamentally important issues to light. I did not know what to expect when I watched this movie, and when i did, I was intrigued. Therefore, I won't tell you what the movie is about because it is best to watch, not knowing what to expect (even to the most high level subjects such as ""main themes""). My advice to all you is to abstain from reading into the movie details before watching the movie and just rent it out like you would rent out an ordinary movie and watch it (preferably alone).

1034,1 July 2005,fatleprechan,10, Philosophical 'Clockwork Orange' Thrills us with it's Lessons,"Anthony Burgess book of the same name is really the rarest of gems in English letters; The philosophical novel. The main character is the near futuristic street thug Alex, played in director Stanley Kubrick's ultra violent screen adaptation by Malcolm McDowell. Who brings a priceless and vicious vigor to the roll which is almost impossible to top. Alex and his gang of 'Droogs' wreak havoc on 21st century London, as they rape, rob and rampage throughout the early scenes of the film and novel alike. Both stories following each other very closely with just a few minor changes. But when Alex is betrayed by one of his traitorous droogs after giving him a thorough 'Tollchocking' He finds himself holding the bag for a burglary gone awry. Which turns into the bludgeoning death of an elderly cat lover. With a long and frightful arrest record Alex finally lands in prison. Where he sets out to convince the in house Chaplin and anyone else who'll listen that he is reformed and ready to rejoin society. And when a radical new treatment becomes available to one lucky inmate. A therapy which can be completed in a mere two weeks. Alex considers himself the perfect candidate to be revamped and released in a fortnight's time. Not realizing that he will become 'A Clockwork Orange.' When Kubrick previewed his film for critics and audiences alike. People were stunned by what they saw. And whether or not you liked it or hated it one thing was for sure. No one had ever seen anything like it. The 'Ultra violence' is amply gratuitous and the rape scenes are harrowing, especially for the era that only immediately followed the sexual revolution. It's hard to imagine that Kubrick got the code and ratings administration to slap an R rating on there. Actually the film was originally hung with an X rating and it only after Kubrick revamped the editing, which included speeding up some scenes which were downright pornographic that he was able to get the labeling changed to an R rating. The dialogue is similar to the dialect which Burgess employed in his brilliant novel. Which is Alex's own mix of Russian, street slang and the regular King's English. Hearing McDowell speak these lines with wit and vinegar is very satisfying. His performance is a special accomplishment. I'm sure he brought more terror and life to this persona than even Burgess, who was also an accomplished conductor and writer of classical music, dared dream. And Kubrick isn't too bad himself. No one had ever even attempted to make a film this daring up to that date. And whether you gather the moral implications or not. There's not one scene that wouldn't entertain as it's own entity. With the engrossing and fascinating McDowell leading the way in almost every frame. Many have called Kubrick the greatest film maker of all time. Including, among others, the not too shabby himself Martin Scorsese. And after watching 'A Clockwork Orange' and being thrilled by it for the umpteenth time. I can find no avenue to disagree. This film is spectacular reel after reel. Do yourself the favor of seeing it for yourself. 10 out of a possible 10. T.H.",

Filled with beautiful cinematography, poetic dialogue and a horrifyingly thrilling score, Clockwork Orange manages to be at once insightful and revolting, disturbing and yet deeply satisfying.

""A Clockwork Orange"" is a movie that will remain on your memory during your entire life, not only for the film's brutal violence scenes, but for the entire social criticism. I mean, few films or few directors know how to transmit their messages like ""Clockwork.."" or dear old Stanley. Even a 12 year old (it is not recommendable though, unless you want a traumatized boy for the rest of his life) can understand the big picture of the film: the alarming fact that the society has become a hostile, violent ecosystem based on drugs, alcohol, popular music and sex. It is such a shame that most of the films of the 21st Century are based on these facts. And sometimes I must admit that I was afraid of Kubrick at sometime because in two of his films: ""2001"" and ""Clockwork"" had very accurate predictions about the not so far future. For example: in 2001, Clarke and Kubrick said that in the 21st century man kind would live in outer space and explore the entire Solar System. Also they described a very intelligent, autonomous computer with its very own feelings. Just think about it: we have the technology (I bet Apple and Microsoft already have their versions of HAL-9000 in development), what we need is the money and the motivation to do it. ""Clockwork"" is even more accurate about this century: hijacks, terrorism, 9/11, drug-dealers in every street of Mexico, Colombia and Central America... it's all there.

1053,2 August 2001,Evan Anderson,10, Best movie I have ever seen!,I totally love this movie.  It is my favorite and will likely remain that way until I die!  If you like bizarre disturbing movies this is for you! The movie is about four guys who beat up people and rape women.  One night the gang leaders members turn on him and he gets caught.  In prison he gets himself into a special form of rehab but it turns out to be more than he bargained for.  If I went any further I would tell too much.  I like this movie mainly because I have a fascination with bizarre disturbing movies. You find those two elements in all it's glory in this movie.  I am also fascinated by the language spoken (nadsat)and the classical music played in the movie.  No one has ever done as much with language as Stanley Kubrick and Anthony Burgess.  I love the english accents and Malcolm Macdowell was made for the role of Alex (your humble narrator)!  Enjoy the disturbing singin in the rain scene!,

A young man, Alex DeLarge (Malcom McDowell), is looking at us as if he's got some kind of grudge against us, and he's got his right eye's eyelashes covered with mascara. Kubrick keeps it like this for a while, and then slowly zooms out. Alex picks up a glass of milk and drinks from it; and what do we see? Naked women posing and being used as tables! They are just statues of course. What kind of women could stay in such a position? This is a STRANGE movie, strange, as you can plainly see, in caps. ALL in caps. He beats a woman with a statue of a penis! What the hell is that all about?! They could of had a statue of Venis DeMilo, or David, but a penis? My God! They make the man dislike Beethoven; what is so bad about Beethoven? Beehtoven, Mozart, Bach, all of the masters of the classical music genre rock! I might have found this movie odd because of my age; I am 13 years old. It is almost hard to believe that this movie was actually rated X! It was pretty bad, but still, porno bad?! Well, as the title means: ""As Queer as a CLOCKWORK ORANGE.""",
1055,26 June 2007,TheMovieCritic_83,9, Amazingly deep.,"There aren't a lot of films that can generate as many feelings as 'A Clockwork Orange'. It has been stated that the amount of controversy this film has caused, amounts to more than all of the controversy of Stanley Kubrick's other films combined. I have to agree with that. The film has been accused of inspiring real life crimes, (of which some claims are undeniably true), and Stanley Kubrick and his family were hit with death threats upon it's release. The film was soon withdrawn from viewing in England, and that stayed in effect for about thirty years. This amazingly deep film has been praised, despised and in some cases been thoroughly misunderstood.",
1056,6 May 2020,grayyoung,10, The scariest film i've seen and it happens to not even be a horror,"A Clockwork Orange is brilliant, let me start there, it pulls no punches and ever scene you're shocked at what is shown to you. The poppy asthetics serve as a strong contrast to the disturbing events and crimes commited by Alex. Lets talk about Alex because he is an absolutely brilliant character. They put Alex through so much yet we never feel for him because due to those brilliant first scenes we are unable to relate to Alex despite his treatment. The treatment in this film oses a question, was Alex truly cured or is he just unable to ACT on his violent urges. We see that Alex attempts to punch or strike some people but simply cannot. Is Alex changed? No, in the end the character of Alex is pure evil and chaos, he deserved everything he got but he never gets his ultimate punishment. Alex is a brilliant character in the way that Alex himself never changes, we only are given the illusion of him changing and told that it is him healing. The dialouge is creepy, brilliant and poetic making the movie feel like more of a play then a movie. I reccomend that you watch the full X rated version as it still shows little outright and the R rated version looses some of the shock factor which doesn't put you into the fear of the moment as much. Eitherway, A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant work of art and I can't reccomend it enough.",

For a while I wasn't sure whether to love or hate it. Of all Kubrick's movies (that I've seen), I'd say this one is the most interesting. It shows the darker side of life, and how everyone participates in perpetuating that. To me it seems to be about how society thinks it can just fix people, change them, and then over tolerate them. But I don't want to simply say what I think the movie is supposed to mean. It's a powerful film that will make you reexamine society and the monsters that hide within it. It also struck me as a little surreal, like many of Kubrick's films tend to. Odd settings and powerful performances make this a compelling movie that should watched with caution.",

I have never witnessed such genius filmaking, with the camera shots, the mesmerizing and absorbing music, and the creepy flow of the film. Anybody who says that there is no point is completely missing the point. Is it right to take away free will, even if that free will is rape and violence? And when everybody gets their revenge on Alex, he is helpless. But what makes the people getting revenge any better than Alex, when they have violent impulses inside them as well. And lets of course not forget the whole political aspect to the movie, as well as the ""what goes around comes around"" theme that is very true to life.

1071,30 October 2007,bambilola90,10, A Clockwork Orange - cinematic masterpiece,"based on the 1968 novel by Anthony Burgess, A Clockwork Orange is a thrilling dark piece of cinema set in a dystopian future. Alex De Large (Malcolm McDowell) finds euphoria in drinking spiked milk in the Korova milk bar, leading his pack of droogs on ventures of ultra-violence and listening to Beethovens ninth. At the beginning of the film, he seems to epitomize evil. Whether it is his seemingly innocent blue eyes and cheeky side grin, that he refers to the viewer as ""Oh my brother"" and himself as ""Your humble narrator"" or the fact that he exudes optimism, charm and charisma, you inevitably end up batting for him and feeling your heart strings pull on his behalf. Through a twist of treachery from his unsatisfied droogs, Alex finds himself at the opposite end of the 'tolchoking' and in jail, where he hears of a new treatment that gets prisoners out of jail earlier. this is where the meaning of the story really comes in, the fragility of the individual. as Alex is being brainwashed, you can't help but feel his sickness as his face convulses with pain and horror. The strange language called Nadsat(meaning 'teenager' in Russian) coined by Anthony Burgess is endearing and Malcolm Macdowell plays the role of Alex with all of his heart, inhabiting the character of Alex rather than acting him, something few actors bother doing nowadays. A Clockwork Orange is stunning in every aspect, visually with the genius of Kubrick and the skills of Macdowell, Aurally with the sounds of Beethoven and other classics and a haunting Moog soundtrack that plays in the most crucial roles and really sets the dark scenes.",

The pacing on this movie is perfect and every scene has so much significance and is memorable. It has the best ending of any movie ever, that will force you to rewatch it multiple times.

Despite Malcolm McDowell playing the part with undeniable and magnetic charisma, the character he plays is an archetype of young gang criminals, finding an elevation of meaning in the crimes they commit in contrast to their otherwise seemingly dim lives.",
1075,26 September 2013,ihab-azar,10, I never thought that a film of any kind will be able to blow me away to an absurd degree but OH MY GOD!!!!!,"I have heard a lot about this movie before i've decided to rent it a few days earlier. I heard about how violent it is and how controversy it caused on it's initial release and its ban (I learned about in my mass media class about violence in the media)even spawning a syndrome in which gangs of young men impersonate the main characters taking journeys of rape and the so-called ""ultra-violence"". After finally renting it and watching it i finally saw what this film really is: Extremely violent, disturbing and sick but ultimately a genius masterpiece and one of the finest works of cinema ever made. In futuristic Britain, young Alex and his gang enjoy going out at nights and hitting raping and cursing everything in their way, but when Alex is caught by the police for murdering (by accident) one of his victims he is sentenced to 14 years of prison, but when ALex hears about a new method that might help him get out of jail quick, which is an experiment that will eventually make him feel sick every time he gets into a situation that might trigger his violent and sexual desires. Alex agrees but while this method helps get out of jail and diminish his violent desires, it also takes away his humanity from him and his ability to make his own choices which leads society to take advantage of him and unleash its violence on him and Begin went through the experiment, he is left helpless against it. Everything about this film, from the script to the direction to the performances to the soundtrack (relying heavily on Beethoven's 9th symphony), and of course the violent and sexual footage that might disturb to a level that some will find too much, all add up to this films ultimate message: How much can the authorities take over the individual's ability to make his/her own decisions and strip him away from humanity no matter who he or she is. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece lives on and will continue to earn new fans every year, if u haven't seen this film before and have the ability to watch it, do yourself a favor and watch it, fro it is one of the greatest, most thought-provoking films ever made",

1083,14 August 2000,blanks,10, an exhilarating experience!!!!,"After 2001: a space odyssey, one could be forgiven of thinking that Kubrick had reached his peak, but of course he topped it with this extraordinary adaptation of Anthony Burgess's accomplished, dazzingly original novel. With perhaps the finest director ever ( after Scorsese ) behind the helm, This is sheer brilliance. Diluting Burgess's unique nadsat language for a more coherent effect. this is satisfyingly accessible yet dazzingly powerful, perfectly rendered, utterly memorable and highly exhilarating. combining careful, perfect pacing, an wicked sense of humour and a brilliant sense of politics. this is filmmaking at it's unparalleled best. The story is correctly simple yet epic and breathtaking in scope. a gang member being captured by the government, subjected to tests and put out into the world, a non violent person skillfully raises issues of freedom of will and corruption highlighted further by his love of Beethoven being taken away from him as well as his love of violence showing the blatant disregard of the government just wanting to please the people without caring what side effects it might have on such people as Alex. Malcolm McDowell is perfect as Alex de Large who's basically a thug but he also employs our sympathy and pity as he is paid back in full for all the bad things he has done which in the film are shown in brilliantly stylized but undeniably disturbing fashion. these feature the beating of an writer Mr Alexander( Patrick Magee,who is superb )and the horrifying rape of his wife to Singing in the rain, the ferocious beating of an old tramp, an attack on a rival gang, group sex and most memorably perhaps, the beating to death of an gymnast with an huge phallus like object. As you might of guessed, this is also an frightening and brilliantly disturbing experience. Often misconceived as a mere video nasty, this is so much more than that, it might be as shocking as it was but with the state of the world as it is today, it's dazzling, brilliantly flawless, impressive vision is coming closer to reality making it even more disturbing and even ahead of it's time today. Utterly unmissable and written and directed to perfection by cinema's most daring auteur to date, this is the finest film made in britain and one of the top 10 ever made. an bold statement perhaps but an true one.",

The bar, the dresses, masks and the particular gangs, everything is needed. I am charmed with the movie for the mixture of violence, music, heap and the dialect that to the hearing can sound rough. Alex is the a unique character for his way of life with extreme likes. The performance of the main characters is impeccable, each one seems to have born for this role. The only thing that set me up at the first time was the speeching and language that is used. but ti was only the first time because like all the good movies, it doesn't give all in the same time. then I comprehend that this slang is very useful to the movie, in the same way that the ultra-violence. In addition the film leaves us to see a reality that has never been easy to see. The attempts of the State for dominating to everything that one that represents a danger for the balance of this one. In this case the State relied on the science, tries to dominate the part that does us more humans, the power of choice.
