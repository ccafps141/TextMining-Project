0,4 November 2010,dee.reid,10," An amazing third ""Story""","Lee Unkrinch directed ""Toy Story 3,"" the third and presumably final installment in the ""Toy Story"" movie franchise. One could argue that this is probably the best one yet (1999's ""Toy Story 2"" remains my personal favorite of the three), and I won't argue with those who think otherwise. I still hold onto ""Toy Story 2"" for deep personal reasons, but ""Toy Story 3"" does build upon events foreshadowed in the previous installment, which does gives this film a weighty emotional punch - a rarity in animated films these days.",/

However Andy's mother donates them by accident to the Sunnyside Daycare. The toys are welcomed by Lotso Bear but sooner they discover that the children mistreat them. Further, they are imprisoned in the daycare by Lotso and his gang. But Woody discovers the intention of the evil bear and returns to the daycare to organize the escape of his friends. ",r
2,17 June 2010,DICK STEEL,10, A Nutshell Review: Toy Story 3,"It was in 1995 that Toy Story signaled the arrival of Pixar, and the rest was history. To date, I have personally always found myself to have enjoyed all of their outputs, and it does seem that Pixar has indeed grown from strength to strength with sophistication in its graphics and attention to detail, but more so that their creative teams have always come out with solid stories to tell, which is always the key beneath all the glossy bells and whistles visuals.",e

4,27 May 2010,The_Fifth_Echo,10, ~One of the Best Trilogies of All Time~,"I attended a special screening for Toy Story 3. I went in with HIGH expectations. I LOVED the first two Toy Stories movies. Toy Story is a beloved franchise that almost everyone that I know loves the first two films. Now how about the 3rd film? Well all I could say is that it lived up to my unbelievably HIGH expectations and then some. This is such a good film. It has the laughs, magic and best of all the entertainment. The new characters in the movie feel like they were in the previous two films, they were that engaging and really worked well in the movie. The best part of the movie has to be the ending, I almost cried and was moved to just about to tears. I truly believe that this is one of the best Trilogies of all time. It might even rival the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.",i
5,18 June 2010,diac228,10," By delivering an amazing finale to an amazing trilogy, all we can do is bow and thank Pixar once again.","Star Wars. Indiana Jones. Fistful of Dollars. Bourne. These are all incredible trilogies that can, will, and should stand the test of time. Yes, I am neglecting the fourth Indiana Jones. Upon the mention of the third Toy Story, I was deathly afraid. Afraid because it has some major, major shoes to fill. The original is a masterpiece that changed animation forever, and the sequel is among the best in the history of film (I mean that). The first two Toy Story films are among the best movies of all-time and to this day entire animation studios have failed to duplicate an ounce of the magic contained in Toy Story. Could part 3 even come close to the original two? My friends, I am very happy to say, the answer is a resounding yes.",e

Toy Story 1 & 2 set the bar high so, frankly, I was expecting a disappointment with this one. Thankfully, it didn't happen. ""Toy Story 3"" was another amazing story in this (so far) trilogy.",w
7,18 June 2010,MovieAddict2016,10," Thank you, Pixar.","I left the theater in 1995 after seeing the original Toy Story strangely moved. I was only six years old, and I'm not sure I had even fully grasped the revolutionary CGI for what it was (it probably just registered as animation to me, and I didn't quite understand its impact), but I did know – at least on a basic level of storytelling – that it was fantastic. Four years later I went to see the sequel with my younger sisters and felt the exact same way I had the first time. Even at a fairly young age I knew there was something special about these films.",/

9,17 June 2010,beastwarsfan,10, Simply brilliant!,"I was about 10 or 12 when I watched the first Toy Story in the cinema with my little brother and sister. We were all enchanted! Years later Toy Story 2 came out and it was a blast! Again we all went to the theater to see it and we were so thrilled and excited after the movie! Im 24 now, and just yesterday I was at the Bulgarian gala-premiere of the film. My brother was fortunate to win an invitation for two (he took a photo of himself with our small collection of Toy Story toys and sent it to the website), and we had the chance to see the third part on its first screening... and for the 1st time in 3D! No doubt that the animation is better than ever, the guys from Pixar constantly push the limits, but that's kinda natural for them. But still it feels like 100% Toy Story, with all the improvements, somehow I don't feel this 15-years-wide gap between the first and the third part.",w
10,18 June 2010,Quinoa1984,10," few trilogies can be considered whole and complete, but this is now one of them","Toy Story 3 brings back nostalgia, but that's to be expected. We all think back to fifteen years ago, or eleven years ago, when the Toy Story movies came out the first time. If you're too young for that, then at least the re-release was last year to catch people up, though it's not quite the same thing. As Andy is off to college- as was predicted would happen as a given in Toy Story 2- we in the audience realize that this third film follows a kind of time-line that runs with our lives. Even if you're an adult (i.e. older than my 20-something age) you can relate to what the toys and Andy are going through. What happens at the end of the film, the resolution of the ultimate conflict of what to do with the toys as life goes on, is one of the most beautiful and heartwarmingly bittersweet (well, more like sad-sweet) moments in recent cinema. Pixar tends to do that.",3
11,27 June 2010,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, A perfect way to end the beloved Toy Story trilogy,"Again, I don't mean to sound like a broken record but it seems like Disney/Pixar is the only competent movie company that produces great films and classic stories. They know how to write, shoot and tell a story well. Toy Story is Pixar's baby, at the time of the first film's release and was the start of what we have today with computer animation. Now the first Toy Story was good, the second Toy Story was great and Toy Story 3 was absolutely fantastic. The stories just get better and better as they keep coming. Bringing back our favorite characters but adding a fun new little twist to them, it brought a new audience in and kept the one's who saw the first one and gave us something new to enjoy. Pixar's last films like Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up kept raising the bar higher and higher, not only are they Disney's great films, but they're also some of the strongest and best films of all time. Toy Story 3 can now be added as this is my favorite of the trilogy, bringing in some great new characters and magic to the story, I couldn't stop laughing and crying with this movie. I thought this was a perfect ending to the trilogy as it gets to all the adults when we had to grow up and give up our childhood toys.",6

19,24 June 2010,xamitlu,8, Toy Story 3 is not a movie for adults who DO NOT want to cry during a movie.,"The only Disney movie I cried in was Lion King. The other Disney film that came close was Pixar's WALL E. I did not cry during Toy Story 3. I went home walked into my room a realized that my Optimus Prime is not at the foot of my door, my Sylvester the Cat stuffed toy was not on my bed, and my McDonald's Sonic the Hedgehog toy was not on my shelf. My conner only housed my stack of video games. I asked myself why did my mother give away my toys without my permission? At THAT moment is when I thought about the last 30 minutes of Toy Story 3 I started to cry. This film was a carelessly thoughtful stoke of genius! It keeps both children and adults entertained. Lots of drama, lots suspense, and lots of toys! Disney and Pixar outdid themselves with this one. Toy Story was a smash hit when it first hit the screens. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, was not as good as its first installment but it was a film that almost never hit theaters so I'll give them the benefit of doubt. But Toy Story 3 set the bar ""to infinity and beyond!"" The VA cast was pheNOMenal. The visuals were stunning! The script was enjoyable! This movie reached all corners of film greatness (and its a kid's movie). I have no idea how Disney and Pixar knock out great movies like this (they make it look easy). I related to Andy in this film just as I did in Toy Story 3. The ending was so tough to watch without sniffling because if you watched Toy Story at around Andy's age during the time and you watch Toy Story 3 around Andy's age now (he was 17 and I am 22 and went through roughly the same hassle as he did when he was moving out for college), you would feel a wallop of emotion. Toy Story 3 is a MUST SEE. If you don't have children to take to go see this film then take friends who saw the first two films.",r
20,22 July 2010,SunshineMike,10, Just amazing,"After seeing Toy Story 1 and 2, they quickly became my favourite set of films ever and just last year when i heard there was going to be a 3rd, my heart immediately sank. As with sequels before, i thought it was going to be aimed at an entirely new audience, for the sake of profit and would squeeze the love i had for the series right out of it.",e
21,18 September 2010,itsacatchphrase,10, Blew me away,So I'm 26 and jaded. I most often hate the world and everything in it. Well that being said I absolutely lost myself watching this movie. I had seen the two before it as a kid growing up but I never felt so strong about them as I do with this one. I have spent the last couple weeks after seeing this movie spreading the word about how awesome it was. The theme is so universal that anyone despite their background or feelings can absolutely relate. We've all been to that place were we feel like we've been used and that were done with. The feeling as if we have nowhere to go or anyone to turn to. I really want everyone to experience the overwhelming feelings that boiled inside of me as this movie came to an end. The second the toys held hands at one point my face absolutely exploded and from there it didn't relent. Seriously I could not breathe it was almost to much. But its not. Go see it. Now.......................................what are you waiting for?,f
22,12 November 2010,savvas172007,10, Back to childhood with a masterpiece...,"I am now 20 years old and so, it was at the age of 7 when I first watched Toy Story. I found it amazing that the toys were alive and all the story was superb either. When I found out that a 3rd part was up to be released I had been dreaming of it all the time. So, I went to watch it. In the theatre there were parents with their kids and thankfully they were really quiet. When the film started with the narration of the ages that had passed, I felt so touched. During the film I was back in my childhood when everything seemed -and were- so easy and I was with no concerns. All the purity of that age came and hit me, although I knew that would happen. I admit that I first found the story average, but when the film was on I was enchanted. There were no thoughts in my mind. I was there watching a masterpiece that in my point of view can be truly appreciated by only us, those who matured since the first movie, but still carrying all the heroes into our hearts. I must admit that I was up to cry in several moments, especially when the toys were in fire and in the end. Leaving the cinema and though I cried -cause, yes, I did!- I was too happy. Entering the house I was singing the theme song...",_

24,18 June 2010,bobsgrock,10," Wondrous, beautiful and something to remember.","From the looks of it, it seems Pixar will never go out of style nor will they make a mediocre or bad film. Once again, going back to that wonderful cast of characters we all love that includes the cowboy Woody, the spaceman Buzz Lightyear, as well as Jessie, Bullseye, Rex, Ham, Slinky and many more, Pixar doesn't just recycle old clichés and story lines. Rather, they use what they have already done and build upon that foundation to create a brand-new, exciting and fantastic adventure.",t
25,16 August 2014,petra_ste,9, Memento Mori,"Disney characters often face death, and yet death itself is usually an anomaly for them, a breach made by villainy in their happy worlds. Toy Story 3, however, might be the first major Hollywood animated feature more or less explicitly *about* death. The premise has the protagonists terrified by the prospect of their now seventeen-year-old owner Andy going to college and getting rid of them. They know they are running out of time: even when they end up as gifts in a daycare run by a dictator-like teddy bear and attempt to escape, the specter of the garbage bin looms over them. It's no coincidence the last act features escathological imagery like the hellish fire of the incinerator or the heavenly sky of the last shot.",t

29,27 June 2010,jordancelticsfan,10, One of the greatest achievements in movie history.,"Just how good is ''Toy Story 3'', you ask? It's simply one of the greatest achievements in movie history, I answer. This film, right now, should win the Oscar for Best Picture, hands down. I honestly doubt there'll be a better film than this all year. That's how absolutely brilliant this movie is. Pixar is officially king of everything! This movie is smart funny, thrilling, engaging, and, most importantly, it taught me about friendship. It taught me to stick by my friends, no matter what. The final sequences of the movie are absolutely breathtaking, and I couldn't help but shed a few tears. It doesn't feel like you're watching an animated movie. In some scenes it feels like you're watching an Alfred Hitchcock film, due to the great thrills, and others you can't help but cry over due to the togetherness of the whole gang. One of the film's themes is obviously never give up. This film can really inspire you. This film is also about loss and letting go. Who knew a film about toys could have such true themes on life. This is a masterpiece, one that once again pulls you in with the characters from the second it starts. Don't go see the grotesque Adam Sandler comedy ''Grown Ups'', or the action flick ''Knight and Day''. Go see this. This film is about a quintillion light years better than both those films. This beats, as great as they were, the first two ''Toy Story'' films. It beats them by a lot, actually. Take your family to go see this, but also, if you're an adult, go see this with adult friends. This is a film to go see with friends. This is the best from the greatness that is Pixar. 10 out of 10, a miraculous, comedic, inspiring, joyful, entertaining, adventurous, smart, tear jerking, and enduring film to cherish until the end of time.",v

I had seen 1 and 2 as a kid so the rewatches were nice, but Toy Story 3 was fresh and I loved it! The call backs to the previous two films were great. The three highlights were those that we have grown accustomed to in all Toy Story movies: A delightful and cheery score, phenomenal voice acting, and an interesting story that teaches a moral lesson. Looking forward to the fourth installment tomorrow!",
32,31 July 2012,ironhorse_iv,9, Toy Story 3 has a friend in me. It's an entertaining watch.,"There are classic movies from our childhood that continues to make an impact on us even when we're adults. 1995 Pixar animation film 'Toy Story' is one of those. It has got better with each sequel. This one directed by Lee Unkrich is probably the best. Still if you haven't watched any the previous flicks; you might want to, before entering into this. The start of the motion picture feels very nostalgia with the dreamlike epic western settling. Following that, I like the VCR style home video montage with the iconic Randy Newman's song playing the background. It made us seem like we were there growing up with Andy voiced by John Morris and seeing the sad tragedy that foreshadowing come with maturing; the loss of children innocent. It's here in the present that we find out that young man doesn't play with his toys anymore as he's about to embark for college. Most of the toys felt abandoned by this; despite Woody (Voiced by Tom Hanks) feeling otherwise. After being mistaken for trash, the group donate themselves to daycare center that seems like paradise only to find themselves imprisoned and exploited by ruthless toys like Lotso well voiced perform by Ned Betty and his second in command Ken (Voiced by Michael Keaton). Without spoiling the movie too much, I kinda like that Disney agree to go along with this plotline rather than Circle 7 Animation's ideas of having the gang go to Taiwan to save Buzz Lightyear (Voiced by Tim Allen) from being recall and a whodunit-style murder mystery story involving the toys being stolen while at grandma's house. Those draft versions felt too out there. I felt that this was more compelling in how familiar and personal it is. Even if the running theme of abandonment, concentration camp like places and near incineration might turn off some as too disturbing or depressing. This movie has a lot of heart. Especially the ending that will bring you to tears. Everybody could relate to that. Another good thing about this film is that there is a lot of good jokes throughout the flick, mostly involving Buzz's off and on switch button function. Seeing him speak and act as a Spanish lover was hilarious. As for the supporting characters. They were mostly fine. Each of them was given something to do in the plot with Mr. Potato Head (Voiced by Don Rickles) shining the most. However, it was a bit jarring not to see characters like Bo Peep voiced by Anna Potts in this with hardly any exposition on where she went. I love the connect, she had with Woody. Nevertheless, most of new characters really connect with Woody nor didn't stand out as much as they should had; besides the villains. As for the action scenes. They were really heart pounding especially the landfill sequence. The animation is really top notch. Glad that Circle 7 Animation went under and Pixar got the rights to finish the film because the low budget that Disney was putting out originally for production would probably kill this film franchise for good in the ground. Instead the motion picture along with its short film 'Day & Night' gross over $1 billion worldwide in ticket sales, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2010. Furthermore, it was nominated at the Academy Awards that year. Not only was 'Toy Story 3' honor of being the third animated film to be nominated for best picture after 1991 'Beauty and the Beast' and Pixar predecessor film 2009 'Up', but it won best animation movie. Yet sadly, I can hardly remember the award-winning song 'We Belong Together' that Newman wrote for this film. So not all the success was memorable. Nevertheless, the movie was followed by several shorts with most of them being quite good to alright mediocre. As for a fourth flick, I really hope Pixar and Disney doesn't make one, because any animation film that follow this masterpiece will not live up to the hype and might be a shell of its former self. In the end, the trilogy of these motion pictures is good enough. Overall: 'Toy Story 3' went to infinite and beyond! It's clearly one worth seeing.",
33,9 August 2022,griffithxjohnson,10, One of the best movies ever made,"The greatest animated film ever. An exciting plot, gut-busting humor & a perfect conclusion that hits like an emotional fright train. You grow & feel with the characters. The animation is gorgeous with great lighting & score.",
34,9 July 2010,philthegreatone-786-63058,9, Toy Story 3 (spoilers),"Toy Story 3 – Firstly to begin with the animation in this film was the best yet, Pixar have done it yet again. It never ceases to amaze me the realistic animation that is available these days. Now the storyline was about Andy going away to college and deciding what to do with his old toys (Woody, Buzz e.t.c), he decides to put them in the attic. Then accidentally he leaves the bag of toys on the floor. His mum then picks them up thinking that they are trash. They somehow manage to get out of the bag and they end up in a box off to Sunnyside daycare centre. At first the toys think this is great and they are in a safe place. Woody is the only one to say that he believes that Andy didn't want to get rid of them and only wanted them in the attic. By the way Woody had been chosen by Andy to go to college. So then the toys try to escape from Sunnyside, in turn trying to get back to Andy. That is the basic plot. Now this is a great film for say age 3 and up, basically for the whole family. You will love the animation. The characters will capture and break your heart again, and it's just so much damn fun. I loved this film, it bought me back to my childhood, and reminded me how much I loved movies, and when I loved to play with my toys. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars. I already strongly recommend the academy to consider it for best picture at the Oscars in February 2011.",
35,9 July 2010,Polaris_DiB,10, We've faced replacement and we've faced neglect--now on to death,"This is now officially one of the most qualitative franchises I can think of, and a Toy Story 4 of even half the quality would send this right to the top past the Alien Quadrilogy. The storytelling is brisk, the animation is beautiful, the scenes range from funny to disturbing to terrifying to heartwarming to outright tear-inducing. The garbage combustion scene alone is bound to give children nightmares, but Buzz bustin' out the flamenco is more than enough to keep this one fun for the whole family. What I like best is that they manage to keep to the spirit, look, and characters of the other movies while still amping up showmanship and surprises, storytelling and subthemes.",
36,9 July 2010,abrown975,10," Oh my god, there is absolutely no animated movie, maybe even movie, better than this one (and I am not exaggerating)!","Oh my god, I cannot stress how good, no GREAT, this movie is! The animation is top notch, of course! You can almost feel the texture of the cloth Woody or Bullseye is made out of just based on it's looks. That's how good it is. The voice acting- superb. They have the original cast with a few added into the mix (some are subtle, like Bonnie Hunt or Whoopi Goldberg), and EVERYONE fits their part! Music- Randy Newman, you never fail to disappoint me, and this is no exception. Humor- Joke after joke, coming at you like bullets, leaving you no time to catch you breath because you're laughing so hard- until the climax, when you are either bawling your eyes out, or your heart is pounding at the speed of light, or both. There are many emotional parts in this movie that you won't forget, especially if you are an adult and have had that one bunch of special toys you just didn't want to let go of when you were a kid. Writing, music, humor, animation, acting, and emotion were all the best in any movie of 2010 and I seriously hope this wins Best Animated Feature, Best Music, and at least be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. So bottom line is- stop reading this review, get off the computer, and go see this movie! And if it's already out on DVD by the time you're reading this, go buy it!",
37,29 October 2014,CMTiago,10, Perfect,"Toy Story 3 is my most cherished movie experience of all time. The whole trilogy is a creative, heartfelt and overall perfect piece storytelling for all ages. With the first movie, we experience jealousy and rivalry between toys, as well as the realization of finding out you're a toy. In the end, the toys come to terms with their differences, and their roles in life and learn to co-exist. Toy Story 2 explores issues of abandonment and how lonely an unused toy can become. However it's with 3 that Toy Story packs a wallop of a tale. ",
38,21 June 2010,ferguson-6,9, Lotsa Chuckles and Genius,"Greetings again from the darkness. Has there ever been a bad Pixar movie? Nope. And as many really good movies they have created, there are now two truly great ones: Toy Story and Toy Story 3. The first one (released 15 years ago) transformed the way animation is made and set the standard for kids' movies that parents can also enjoy. This third installment takes animated story telling to the next level.",
39,20 June 2010,zetes,9," Exceptional, of course.","Pixar is unstoppable. Heck, I'm even anticipating Cars 2 (which they are making, alongside Monsters Inc. 2). About the only thing I didn't like too much was the film's villain, who is pretty much an echo of the villain from the previous Toy Story movie. He even suffers pretty much the same fate. Otherwise, this is just masterful. Andy, the toys' owner, is now 17 and about to head off for college. He is forced to decide what to do with his old toys. Throw them away, donate them to a local day care or store them away in the attic? He chooses the latter option (except for Woody, whom he chooses to take with him), but, through a series of misunderstandings, they get set on the curb. They narrowly escape, and decide to jump into the donation box. At first, the day care seems like heaven on Earth: it doesn't matter that these kids will grow up, because a whole new set of kids is always arriving. Unfortunately, there is a pretty cruel society between the toys that has been established at the day care. Buzz and Andy's other toys are left to be destroyed by toddlers who treat them roughly. The stuffed bear Lotso (Ned Beatty) and his minions rule from a room full of grade schoolers. Meanwhile, Woody, who got trapped in the car and ended up donated, as well, tries to make his way back. On his way, he discovers the truth about the day care and goes back to rescue them. The film contains the same feelings and themes of the previous movies, but it has a somewhat more somber tone to it. Of course, it's mainly an adventure film, and it's extremely exciting. The escape from the day care ranks among the great escape movies (unlike Chicken Run, which just feels like a cheap parody of them). At the end of the film's climax there is a bit that is so emotionally overwhelming that it'll probably be remembered as one of Pixar's best moments ever, right next to the Carl and Ellie sequence that opens Up, the final moment in Monsters Inc. or the space walk in Wall-E. In my mind, the whole relationship between Barbie (a donated toy that belonged to Andy's little sister) and the Ken doll she meets at the day care is one of the funniest things ever. The Ken character (voiced by Michael Keaton) is especially hilarious when putting on a fashion show for Barbie. He might well be my favorite character in the entire series.",

The first toy story movie was by far my favorite movie as a child, i literally watched it two or three times a day. Im emotionally attached to the toy story movies so this movie felt like the closing chapter to my childhood. Aside from my emotional attachment this movie was still amazing! I laughed, which is expected since its the all might pixar. But i also cried...i was kinda embarrassed haha.

But by the end of the movie i couldn't hold back and instead of watery eyes i was in full tears haha. Everyone should watch it!",

Toy Story 3 proves that the third film of a series does not have to be the weakest and that it can sometimes even be the strongest. Toy Story 3 is just as magical as the first two offerings and the quality of the animation is second to none. Now I don't necessarily remember exactly what happens in the previous two toy stories but I remember liking them a lot and how the stories were great. I feel that Toy Story 3 is the best out of the 3. Toy Story was great but the third one does it the best, in my opinion.",

44,24 February 2017,sol-,6, Falling with Style Part 3,"Convinced that a now college-aged Andy intended to throw them out, his toys take refuge at a daycare centre with unexpectedly rough kids in this third film in the ""falling with style"" franchise. The movie tackles slightly different ideas to what we have seen before with Andy torn between moving on and hanging onto the toys he once cherished. There is also a magnificent sequence in which are treated to the detailed insides of a landfill station. For the most part though, the plot of 'Toy Story 3' bares such a strong resemblance to Parts One and Two that it never quite feels like a motion picture of its own. Once again, the story is propelled by the toys not believing and trusting Woody (as per the first film) before meeting an antagonist who initially appears friendly and jolly, which then leads to them making a daring escape (as per the second film). The antagonists in both the second and third film even meet with similar fates! The themes and issues are also strikingly familiar with owners who move on and toys who find themselves no longer wanted. The film does have novelties up its sleeve though. The Mr. Tortilla Head scenes are delightfully zany and the parody of prison escape movies works quite well. There are also some great new toys - even if they do not get a whole lot of screen time. Capped off with an emotionally charged finale (watch for Andy's face and eyes), it is easy to see why many have been won over by the charm of 'Toy Story 3', even if it does not pull in anywhere near as many new directions as the previous films.",

And yet, somehow, I always find myself feeling doubtful whenever a trailer for one of their new films is released. With Toy Story 3, I got the impression that it would be just another adventure with Woody and the gang for the sake of having one. So, with this, and a movie year that has been relatively lacking so far, would Toy Story 3 disappoint? The answer: absolutely not.",

I still think I like the first one better by just a small margin, but that does not mean this one is anything short of incredible. I don't cry during movies, but the ending of this movie is one of the closest I've ever come to crying. This and The Green Mile. Definitely the second best Toy Story movie.

In some ways I feel the 3rd entry of this brilliant trilogy is more for me than it is for younger viewers. In many ways it is the perfect conclusion to this story. What I loved about the film was that it acknowledges the journey our characters went on. In many ways I did emotionally invest myself with Buzz and Woody more so than I'd like to admit.

Their two ""missteps"", ""Cars"" and ""A Bug's life"", are disappointments only in that they don't contend for best movie Pixar has made. They're A minuses instead of A's. ""Toy Story 3"" joins the pantheon of great Pixar films, and all-time great sequels. It stands out as the best film of 2010 at this point. While it may not be as brilliant from start to finish as the second ""Toy Story"" film (the animated equivalent of ""The Godfather Part II""), is so engaging, so witty and entertaining and exciting, that adults and children will be pulled in all the way. And the third act ramps up the emotion to a degree equal to the best of it's predecessors (my 5 year old nephew had to turn around and ask ""why are you cwying?"") The highly publicized plot line deals with the toys beloved owner Andy moving on to college, and choosing the fate of his beloved toys. Through one of those complex farcical events that seems so common in Andy's household, the attic bound toys (minus Woody, who is supposed to go to college with Andy) are accidentally donated to a daycare center. Woody, of course, has to rescue his friends, but there is some doubt as to whether they want to be rescued: Andy hasn't played with them for years, and the daycare, a toytopia presided over by lovable teddy bear named Lotso Hogs Bear (voiced by Ned Beatty, in a welcome return to the screen), promises the chance to be played with everyday. And when these kids get older, new kids replace them. To the love starved toys (especially Jesse the yodeling cowgirl, who is terrorized of repeating the experience she had with her beloved Emily), this seems like the opportunity of a lifetime. It goes without saying that all is not as it seems.",

I just couldn't wait so today, my first day off since the weekend, I watched with my movie theatre-working friend who had previously seen it when it arrived and didn't mind rewatching it with me. Anyway, with Andy now grown up and on his way to college, it seemed he didn't need Woody, Buzz, or the others anymore but while he was going to take the cowboy with him, the others were going to the attic but there was a mix-up and somehow they all end up in a daycare center. I'll just stop there and just say I was laughing, crying, and a little scared all at the same time. It's that enjoyable especially with the way Buzz changes in many sequences. Of course, there has to be a villain and he comes in a teddy bear named Lotso, voiced by Ned Beatty. There's a few more surprises but I don't want to spoil them here (though I'm putting a spoiler warning anyway in case you didn't want to know what I just revealed in previous sentences). One more thing, it was nice to hear the return of the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Wallace Shawn, Don Rickles, Estelle Harris, and John Ratzenberger and that Blake Clark did a nice job of replacing the late Jim Varney as the Slinky Dog. Oh, and finding out the director, Teddy Newton, of the preceding short-Day & Night-is the voice of the talking Fisher-Price toy telephone is one of the nice things about reading the IMDb board.

Kids may learn the value of appreciating and taking good care of their favorite toys. Pixar's Toy Story movies are all about friendship, loyalty, and ""being there"" for Andy and for each other. Through teamwork, perserverance, and collaboration, Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Bullseye, Hamm, Mr. & Mrs. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Rex band together to overcome their many obstacles and disagreements. Sharing, curiosity, and ingenuity are all celebrated. Andy's toys are all courageous and willing to sacrifice themselves for each other. Woody is one of the most loyal characters in movie history -- his dedication to Andy above all else is admirable (if sometimes hard for his friends to understand) -- and over the course of the three films truly learns humility. The rest of the toys are also quite brave and helpful, and they don't quit on Buzz when he's not acting like himself. Even the alien ""kids"" are quite willing to do anything and everything to save their ""parents"" Mr. And Mrs. Potato Head and friends from danger. Toy Story 3 introduces some new characters who aren't as admirable as Andy's crew, but they face the consequences of their behavior in the end -- and some even get a fresh start. Several of the Toy Story characters are recognizable brands (like Barbie, Ken, and Mr. & Mrs. Potato Head).

Warmly and touchingly animated (in wondrous 3-D too boot too!) by the studio artistic geniuses and expert direction by Lee Unkrich with a very shrewd (and decidedly darker) screenplay by Michael Arndt collaborating with John Lassetter, & Andrew Stanto and Unkrich. Among the new standouts is Keaton as the 'metorsexual' Ken doll (acerbically full of himself). One of the year's best.",

94,27 December 2014,paul2001sw-1,8," Not quite as fresh as its predecessors, but still funny and moving","The original 'Toy Story' was not only the world's first fully digitally animated feature, but also funny and original, the story of toys who just wanted to be played with, but who lived with the fear of redundancy and, in the case of Buzz Lightyear, an identity crisis (Buzz believing himself to be a real spaceman, and not just a toy). It played with the dual life every child ascribes to their toys, and brilliantly exploited its novel medium's ability to combine realism and fantasy. The sequel was pretty good as well. 'Toy Story 3' isn't bad either, although the idea is, inevitably, not quite as fresh in its third outing, the basic dynamic of the plot mirroring that of the two earlier films. There are still some fine moments: when Buzz gets stuck in his Spanish mode, the result is truly hilarious, and the scene in the furnace room more affecting than a story about talking toys has any right to be. The ending of the tale implies this is probably the final outing for these characters, and I think that's the right decision. But the series remains comparable in its quality to the best of Pixar's subsequent, much-admired work.",

The first 2 parts are amazing, the first deserving an honestly 8,9 and the second a better 9,1, but because of the hype of Toy Story 3 I was a little bit skeptic about how good it would be.

Toy Story 3 is living proof, vivid and playful and touching and meaningful at or above the lofty levels of their mid-peak masterworks. With a true ensemble cast, it allows the old stars to spin their familiar spells while tossing in a few new supporting players (Michael Keaton as Barbie's beau Ken is especially entertaining) but wisely doesn't focus on any single character for too long. With a roster this well developed, still clicking deep in their third feature, why not celebrate that kind of rare, wonderful diversity? I'm glad Pixar waited to tell the right story, too: the level of care, meaning and power that's on display here simply doesn't come around all that often. Let's do it right or not at all, yeah? Needless to add, it's a stunner visually, with brighter colors, more brilliant settings and no shortage of Pixar charm fitting right in alongside the timeless character designs and visual themes of the two preceding films. An essential tale that's effectively moving, sweet, heartfelt and hilarious... and maybe even the best chapter of the trilogy.",

114,27 June 2010,meeza,9, Yea Toyyyyyy!!!,"I do sincerely apologize for being punfully playful in my movie review of the extra charming ""Toy Story 3"". Yes once again, I will be a Mr. Puntatohead! ""Toy Story 3"" is a room full of entertainment heaven. It is that good! I am not toying with you! This Toy story picks up when a grown Andy is preparing to leave to college, and unsure on what to do with his classic toys he has cherished throughout his past childhood. The same cast of Andy Toy characters are back; of course headed by Woody The Cowboy and Buzz Lightyear. But as the last Toy story, new toys are introduced to this story including a toy boy for Barbie, and that would be none other than Ken. The Andy toy family eventually end up in a day care center called Sunnyside, even though the toys end up being more scrambled than sunnyside up by a feisty group of toddlers. The so-called toy leader at the Sunnyside Daycare is a conniving bear called Lotso, who has lotso devious plans to hold the Andy toy entourage as prisoners. However, Toy Story 3's primary premises play more with the concept of the agony & denial of ""letting go"", and the togetherness of loved ones. Not to mention, the specialness effect that childhood toys could have on one throughout an entire lifetime. There were a few handkerchief moments in the teary story of ""Toy Story 3"". Academy Award winning screenwriter Michael Arndt scribed an exuberant and heartwarming screenplay which should present him a revisit to the Oscar red carpet. Director Lee Unkrich was precise with his handling of these toys, and the rest of the Pixar clan were once again terrific. And woodynt you know it, the vocal performances of Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, and Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head were a thing of beauty! I especially liked Michael Keaton's vocal work as Ken. In no way, shape or form ""Toy Story 3"" belongs in the toylet. It is a classic tale that both children and adults will adore, even though some kids might not see a baby doll the same way again. The final buzz is that ""Toy Story 3"" will live in all us for infinity and beyond. And that truth is not light years away! ***** Excellent",

A perfect ending closes the film and at the end of the credits you cannot hold the tears,"Rescuing ""Toy Story"", ten years after the second film, reinforces that taking risks is also one of the virtues of the studio. It means the return to the franchise that marked an era in world cinema, having raised Pixar to the status it now maintains with ease. But they definitely know where they are stepping. They know the steps that must be taken to achieve the same success and, even better, those that must be taken to overcome it. That's right. ""Toy Story 3"" is better than its predecessors and ends with tears of happiness what was already historic. This third part is epic from the first scene. The opening sequence is already a warm-up for what will come next: lots of adventure, humor in the right measure and a delicious nostalgia. With each film, we follow a new stage in the life of Andy, the owner of the toys. Now, 15 years after we met him, he is ready to go to college and his mother puts pressure on him to fix his room, separating what will be kept in the attic, what will be donated and what will go to the trash.

Something goes wrong when Buzz, Woody, and all their toy friends get donated to Sunnyside Day Care Center. The day care center is run by Lotso (voice of Ned Beatty), a seemingly nice teddy bear with some evil plans. This Toy Story has everything you would want in a summer blockbuster-action, laughs, thrills, drama, and even moments where if you don't cry, you truly do not have a soul. I enjoyed the addition of Ken (voice of Michael Keaton) and his love for Barbie as well. All the voice actors do amazing jobs. The first 2 Toy Story films were flawless, and this still manages to out beat them. There's a kind of sweetness to all these films that make it so that both kids and adults can enjoy them. Even if you don't have kids, you still need to see Toy Story 3 because it is simply put it, by far the best film of the year so far.",

It is not a little children's movie. No kid under 7 should see it unless they have already been jaded by watching stuff too mature for them. It seems as if the producers were aiming their script at the audience that saw Toy Story 1 when it first came out 12 years ago in theaters. Because it is too perverse for today's children. It is a brilliantly edited and filmed technical achievement which has a lot of laughs, but there is an undercurrent of tragedy, hurt, and despair that runs through the lifeblood of this picture. It is unnecessarily cruel with some of its back-stories and comeuppances.

I waited until now to write a comment—not really compelled to generate something quickly. Tom Hank's beloved cowboy toy Woody stares off to the distance and says, ""So long partner."" I got a lump in my throat. For me Woody is really saying, ""I will always love you, partner."" However, this catharsis of unconditional love and legacy does not seem to culminate from the chaos of the Daycare Center, the chases, and crises.

This film will blow you away on many aspects. First off, just the transition of the animation since the first film back in the 1990s. It's simply beautiful and looks so epic and realistic I swore I was there in this Pixar film. Secondly, a screenplay so vivid and surprisingly smart that nothing is overdone, nothing is drawn out, it's just simply brings the trilogy to a climax. For example, in my humble opinion I believe ""The Incredibles"" ultimately tried too hard to be a real action flick when it should've stuck to the laughs.

The idea of squeezing a few more bucks out of people by rehashing a successful title, I find despicable. Even though I am a Pixar fan, I thought ""Toy Story 2"" was their weakest release to-date. But THIS movie, well, this is a work of art on its own right. Calling it a sequel is like saying that ""Wicked"" is a prequel to The Wizard of Oz. The love to the characters and the story shines through every scene, and the emotions the movie invokes are genuine: you will laugh, you will cry, and you will sometimes do the two simultaneously. The folks at Pixar continue to amaze me by topping both their CGI abilities and their storytelling abilities each and every time. Here, CGI highlights include clutter, voluminous light and fire effects. (When I watched James Cameron's Avatar I distinctly recall thinking ""well, they've got the water, fabric and skin right. I guess we'll have to wait until Pixar makes a fire movie in order to see realistic CGI flames..."") Clutter we already saw much of in Wall-E, and other stuff (fur, facial expressions, gravity, wind, etc.) that Pixar pioneered in earlier films now take their places in the background, making the world of ""Toy Story 3"" much more real and large than in earlier movies, without upstaging anything.",

Even the short film before it, Day and Night, complemented the movie very well. It was visually amazing. Also, it has a great story. The 'old'characters were still lovable as well as the new ones. Barbie and Ken were great addition to the series. Big Baby was a bit scary though. Many scenes made the crowd inside the cinema laugh real hard but there were also those scenes that silence covered the entire room and sobs were the only sound that can be heard. The ending is very sad. It's so sad that it really had me crying on my seat. Just imagine, I'm an 18 yr old college guy and it had me crying like a baby. Well, it didn't embarrass me at all because when I turned around, people were crying too. So it turned out that I'm not the only one. That scene was just so perfect, with the right timing of music and the proper execution of emotions on the characters' faces, it's just so right. So for the last installment of, I must say, the well loved series, it is indeed the best. With the right amount of laughter, thrill, and tears, it is totally an emotional roller coaster ride. :)",

I have a 11 year old son who LOVED the Toy Story characters, yet during the movie; even at the end he was far more composed then his old man. TOY STORY 3 is a wonderful film. Read the other reviews for plot descriptions and more superlatives as I agree with them all. For us folks with kids I can tell you I believe the root cause why you maybe so moved to tears as I was. Through our children we learned about and grew to care about these characters. They represent our children's early childhood; a time for joy and wonders. Now our children are growing into teenagers and we collectively weep for those days not long ago we could marvel at how our children would drag around a Tattered Woody or hold up a Buzz Lightyear and exclaim ""To infinity and beyond!"". If your children ever pulled you through Disneyland and waited in line to stand with Woody and Jesse, get a photo and maybe even an autograph, this film will so remind of those lost days that well....lets just say bring tissue and thank god for the 3 D glasses as you don't want anyone to see you crying over what my son says ""Is a cool movie...for little kids"".",

172,21 March 2012,jfgibson73,10, Changed my mind about so many things,"Toy Story 3 blew me away. I wasn't a fan of the series before; now, I love all the movies and characters. The animation is so beautiful to look at that you couldn't give anything less than a perfect grade in that aspect. The voicework/acting is almost as impressive. It seems like such a miracle that anyone was able to assemble a cast where every player is able to make so much out of their characters. No one falls flat or disappoints. If I have one criticism, it's that it's a little too action-based and busy. There aren't really any moments like in Wall-E where you're just watching things happen--every moment is pushing the story along, explaining things, and moving to the next obstacle. I also thought there were too many scenes of toys finding ways to break out of places. I understand it is basically a prison-escape movie, but there were so many sequences like this, it felt overdone. I can't let these nitpicks affect my overall rating, however, because this movie does something so amazing with the final goodbye sequence, it makes up for all of it. I think that for me, it is the most special moment in any movie I've ever seen. I only wish I could have watched this movie in theater as a fan of the series already. And then all the extra stuff during the credits just adds a tremendous amount of more storytelling. It's so totally satisfying that this almost instantly became one of the movies that I care about so much that I don't want to watch it too often, so that it remains as affecting as possible. Put all this together along with the short cartoon ""Hawaiin Vacation,"" which continues the story, and I am begging for a fourth Toy Story. The filmmakers pulled off a number of miracles, but think about how staggering this is: not only does this movie build upon the characters and their choices over the previous two movies, not only is it more rewarding for culminating all the themes and emotional payoffs in the first two, but even after wrapping it all up with the most beautiful resolution possible--maybe the greatest movie ending ever--it also sets up a new beginning that is just as rich for exploring. Even more than Andy, I want to see what life is like for the toys with Bonnie. I would buy a movie of just Bonnie playing with the toys for an hour and a half. I wish I could let everyone who worked on this know how much it means to me and how inspiring it is. Awesome.",

I will discuss that shortly. The original voice cast was brought back, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Wallace Shawn and Don Rickles. The story structures were kept intact, toys escaping from concrete areas. Since Pixar's technology has really developed, so have the environments and you will experience them in 3D pretty well.

183,13 July 2010,pcongleton-1,9, As Andy grows up so does the Toy Story franchise.,"What troubled me the most about this film was it felt like it was the same story (Andy leaves the room, Toys get lost or in trouble, Toys need to work together to get home, Antagonist makes life tough for Toys, etc), but as the film unravels you remember the real reason you are here. To see Pixar animation come to life, beautifully I might add, and to be entertained for an hour and a half. All our returning friends are back, minus a few, but now Andy is 17 and moving onto college and the fates of the Toys are sealed. The characters who are gone are replaced by some new and exciting characters. The film also opens up with a new adventure in the beginning that is exciting too. This part was never done in the other two films either and gave a new dimension to this film. It obviously is an adventure that is generated by the ideas found in Andy's head but the Pixar team gives it to you like it was totally real. The interesting thing about the story is the parallel lines between Andy's situation and the mood the film will eventually take that catapults it into being one of the best films of this summer. As Andy grows up so does the Toy Story franchise. This film takes a startling, but welcoming turn towards the mature side of things and dishes out a dark side and a violent side that tells us that the Toy Story world has grown up. I don't want to say what happens, but it is jarring. Some highlights are Potato Head as a tortilla shell, Barbie & Ken, Michael Keaton expertly handling the voice of Ken and an homage to the now classic theme song ""You Got a Friend in Me"" in Spanish. In my opinion it still isn't as good as the original, but damn close. It is a fond farewell (hopefully not the last).",

Toy Story has been with us for 15 years now (20, in terms of actual development) and I had a sinking feeling that maybe all the character potential had been used in the first two and this was some shameless plot by Disney to exploit the franchise (""Little Mermaid 2"", anyone?).

It's funny, heartfelt, beautifully animated and contains one of my favourite villains of all time in Lotso, who works as a relatable and scene-chewing villain at the same time. As with all of the films in the Toy Story franchise, it manages to look at an interesting perspective on the life of a toy in what their life would be like at a daycare, and the execution is second to none. The characters are still as fun as ever to see on screen, and the new characters are given enough screen time to each have distinct personalities and quirks whilst still not taking the focus off of the central plotline. I think now, as I start to grow out of things that I enjoyed when I was younger, the Andy parts really hit home for me. And the ending is quite possibly my all-time favourite.

In the company of the characters we have come to know and love over the previous two movies, together with some new ones, we embark on one last adventure which is full of thrills, excitement, humour, scary bits, and tearful emotion before arriving at a moment which brings the Toy Story films to an entirely appropriate conclusion. The story is predicated on the problem of what to do with Andy's toys now that he is going to college, and the plot involves the complications which ensue when most, but not all, of the toys are donated to a daycare centre - the central section is effectively an extended prison break caper.",

After really great movies from franchise this one was again complicated and what is more important it is following formula of previous successes .

Only to keep with the family tradition, Toy Story 3 is going to run the same fate as one of the greatest movies ever. This is a spectacular movie, inspiring, moving and hilarious all at the same time. It touched me, made me cry and made me think about what's really important in life. I usually don't care much about technical variables. e.g. the animation itself. But in this case the plot and the animation are so brilliantly delivered that it's hard to imagine one without the other. There is one scene in particular (and don't worry I won't tell you which) that will pass the test of time as one of the greatest moment of this beautiful form of art.",

Technically speaking, all characters outsmarted their earlier performance both animation-wise and character-wise. What we expect Woody or Buzz to do is right there. At one moment, when Buzz goes Spanish all the theatre exploded in laughter it was hilarious. When Andy is giving away the toys you could hear people crying both young and adults and unashamedly. The didactic feature gains more importance because it is not straightforward. Toy Story makes us think about themes such as boredom, the purpose of our existence, retirement, loyalty, friendship, trust, the environment, giving for charity, the fact that at one moment we need to let go of things we cherish because holding on to the past makes things stagnant. We only learn to appreciate the things we have (including emotions) when are about to lose them. Yet, we must be courageous enough to keep moving forward. All are great lessons. What's more important is that there is no glorification of crime Hollywood style. I advise people to watch it again and again and take their kids too.",

Pixar has always made wonderful, artsy films that not only express a great message and feel, but they express great color and animation to them as well. The first Toy Story came out in 1995 making it Pixar's first film all around and it seemed that after Toy Story came out, hand drawn animation laid in it's grave while a new age of CGI animation started dominating the market and revolutionized a whole new era of movies.

210,26 July 2010,jboothmillard,9, Toy Story 3,"The first two are rated five stars by the critics, and I was worried this third film rated four stars wasn't going to be quite as good as the predecessors, but I was pleasantly. Basically Andy (John Morris) has grown up and preparing to leave for college, and he has to decide what is going to happen with the remainder of his most loved toys. Woody (Tom Hanks) is surprised to be put in Andy's college box, while Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the rest of the gang are put in a black bag meant to go in the attic. But Woody watches as Andy is interrupted and the bag is mistaken for trash, so when the toys do manage to escape the garbage disposal van, they get themselves in the box heading for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody is forced to go along with them, and he tried to convince them that Andy meant them to go in the attic, and that Daycare isn't going to be the same as having a real owner. When they arrive at Daycare they are welcomed by all the resident toys, led by cuddly teddy bear Lotso (Deliverance's Ned Beatty), and his second in command Ken (Michael Keaton), who is smitten with Barbie (The Little Mermaid's Jodi Benson). Woody is fed up of trying to get them to believe him, and he manages to escape, but with his mode of escape he winds up flung into a tree and in the hands of child Bonnie (Emily Hahn). Meanwhile, Buzz has been turned into his former self believing he really is a space ranger, and all the other toys have been trapped by Lotso who knows the chaos the much younger children can cause playing with them. Mrs. Potato Head (Estelle Harris) also comes to realise that Woody was telling the truth about Andy meaning to put them in the attic, because of her missing eye catching it, and Woody meanwhile is hatching a plan to bust out the gang out of Sunnyside. After a number of Great Escape style moments, and Buzz turning Spanish (Javier Fernandez Pena), all the toys make it out of the compound, but not without Lotso catching up to them, and forcing them to go heading for the dump. Lotso betrays the toys to make his own escape, and the toys look like they will face their end heading into the incinerator fire, but thankfully the Aliens (Jeff Pidgeon) grab them with their beloved Claw. The toys manage to make it home, where Andy is luckily not quite finished packing, Buzz and the others expect Woody to go to college with Andy, but he makes a choice to write a note for Andy to find. This note is the address of the little girl he had a wonderful playtime with, Bonnie, and Andy hands over his beloved toys one by one to her, he even sacrifices Woody who was with him since he could remember. Before he leaves, Andy has a final play with his toys and Bonnie, and drives away knowing his toys will be in good hands, and he says a thank you, and the toys are happy to have an owner again. Also starring Joan Cusack as Jessie, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Blake Clark as Slinky Dog, Bonnie Hunt as Dolly, Whoopi Goldberg as Stretch, Timothy Dalton as Mr. Pricklepants, Laurie Metcalf as Andy's Mom, R. Lee Ermey as Sarge, Teddy Newton as Chatter Telephone, Bud Luckey as Chuckles, Beatrice Miller as Molly, Charlie Bright as Young Andy and Tom and Jerry: The Movie's Richard Kind as Bookworm. The characters are all still lovable, and all your emotions are pulled, I honestly thought it was going to be the end when they were heading into the incinerator, and the emotion returned when Andy said his goodbyes. The film also brings you the same range of good emotions, including great new characters voiced by great talent, and great comic moments, including Ken doing his posing for Barbie, Buzz turning Spanish, and Mr. Potato Head becoming a flat bread wrap and much more, and the creepy moments are with the Big Baby. If this is going to be the last time we see Woody, Buzz and the gang, then I think it has been left on a good note, it is a great fun animated comedy adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Song for Randy Newman's ""We Belong Together"" and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Sound Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film.

And it absolutely does. Toy Story 3 follows the 11 year absent of the two previous films and off the Andy going to college. The toys including Woody and Buzz Lightyear are being donated to a daycare center. The toys were ecstatic about it until they found out that the kids there are disgusting and there is a huge evil bear with a one-eyed baby doll guarding them. Adding adventure to the already interesting plot, Woody and the gang decided to humorously escape the center with great style. Director Lee Unkrich, who is not new at all to the Pixar directing department, he's been responsible for Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and co-director of Toy Story 2. So picking him for the job is not a bad idea. He brought something completely new to the table and turned the story around with twists and thrills. Lee Unkrich had done a decent job of directing this beloved film which had both adults and kids crying their hearts out. From the beginning where Andy's home videos are being played to the end where Andy was saying his final good-byes to the toys, Toy Story 3 is a must-see for all ages and it touched all of our hearts one way or the other.

Eleven years have passed since the first sequel to their 1995 classic hit theaters, but the Toy Story franchise has lost none of its magic or charm. In preparation for the third installment, I got cozy on my couch, popped the first two movies into the DVD player and found myself fully immersed once again in the world Woody, Buzz and their friends inhabit, the world that represents a distinct part in the childhood years of an entire generation. With top-notch animation (at least for that time), clever dialogue, stories that mixed humor, action and emotion and nuanced, likable characters, it's obvious why Toy Story became the beloved icon it is, transforming Pixar from a fledgling company into the most trusted, reliable studio in Hollywood in less than a decade. As a result, Toy Story 3 had big shoes to fill and any skepticism in the months and years preceding its release are certainly understandable, yet any doubts can now be thrown out the window: the film has met, and for some even surpassed, expectations.",
219,23 June 2010,rockinkettles-1,10, Welcome Back Toys!,"The gang is back in Toy Story 3 in what may just be the final story. I can't believe it has been 12 years since we last saw Woody and all his pals. If this is the final Toy Story, then it is definitely a good send off. Andy is going off to college so the toys are put in a garbage bag and supposed to be put in the attic. All the toys that is except Woody who is put in Andy's College box to take with him. Mom thinks the bag of toys is garbage, so out they go on the curb. Woody of course saves his friends and eventually they all, even Woody, end up at Sunnyside Daycare Center which turns out to be the Daycare from Hell for toys! The toys are controlled by Lotso the purple stuffed bear who the gang thinks is nice at first. Lotso turns out to be a bitter evil toy who takes out his frustrations on other toys ever since he was abandoned by his owner. Instead of Woody and the gang being in a section with mature kids who take care of toys, they are put in the section where untamed children are their worst nightmare. This Toy Story is a little darker than the others but it is still funny and at times exciting when the toys try to plan their escape from Sunnyside which is anything but sunny. We also get to meet a whole new gang of characters that are a welcome addition to the old gang. Ken and Barbie have some good funny scenes together as well as Buzz and Jessie, the cowgirl. Buzz gets changed at some point into Spanish mode so he falls for Jessie and dances with her. Jessie likes the Spanish Buzz. She finds him to be romantic. The ending will have you on the edge of your seat and probably even cheering for Woody and the gang. And you really will wonder, is this the end for good for our friends? Pixar has a great imagination when it comes to these kind of movies. There are some classic one liners and moments that will even bring a tear to your eye.

226,27 July 2010,MarcusJ13,10," Just as good, no brilliant as the predecessors.",After seeing all the hype and good press about this film I thought this was going to be brilliant as Toy Story is what Pixar have done best in my view. In Toy Story 2 we got a very ominous piece of dialogue about how Andy is growing up and there is nothing Woody can do about it. I loved that they went with this approach with the next film as they could have just played it safe and have Andy as an excitable child again for the third act but it all comes full circle and we finally see Andy as young man going off for pastures new leaving his childhood behind. Without meaning to sound too deep and meaningful this is something we can all relate to as we've all had that feeling of having to leave our most precious of memories behind. As an 18 year old I can relate to it now. ,
227,21 June 2010,dadrifter-1,10, Simply Amazing,"I watched Toy Story 3 on its midnight premiere. It was great to have the crowd behind the characters, but also the story was really fun and emotional. It also helped that I have grown up with these characters (literally) the first one came out around the same time I was Andy's age and 1999- toy story 2 was 8. Now 10 years later the character Andy and I are both graduating, I always thought that was cool that pixar progressed his age, sorry for digressing. But anyways this movie is amazing, it breaks all the flaws of a second sequel a complete rarity. First most all the characters and voice overs come back except for slinky who sadly passed away but his friend voiced this one but its spot on, also there is explanation as to the whereabouts of the other toys that we do not see, bo beep, etch a sketch, and squeak. Leaving no apparent plot wholes. The story also progresses at a good pace, and makes you feel like a kid again, rooting for the characters every step of the way, it makes you hope that at the time of the movie your old toys are conversing waiting for you to play with them. Very nostalgic in that sense, I don't think at all that this was just a venture for Pixar to make more money, because the movie it so great! oh and all you Miyazaki fans, TOTORO has a cameo*!!!!

So when the ground-breaking production company decided to return to an old friend in 2010 after three straight years of cutting-edge family film-making, you had to know there was a compelling reason to go back to the toys that wasn't merely monetary.

If truth be told, how good do the studio pushers and enlisted creative staff need to strive for it to be?

In this adventure Woody and the gang wind up in a preschool after their owner Andy leaves for college. I loved the new characters including Stretch the purple octopus voiced by Whoopi Goldberg. The plot was pretty good, the characters were great, and the animation was so beautiful it just blows you away. The only thing that I was disappointed about was replacing Jim Varney with Blake Clark which I don't think Pixar should of done. They should of written Slinky Dog out but that's just my opinion. All in all Toy Story 3 was really great and lives up to the first two films. I recommend it for anyone. 10/10. Good job again Pixar.",

244,15 June 2019,Ryan_Barbakins,9, An incredible Ending to a Perfect Trilogy,"Wow. This film incredibly wraps the entire trilogy in an emotional bow that will leave you with tears.
The beginning sets the mood for this film as dark and unlike the others which were much more playful and exciting. Seeing Andy call his toys ""Junk"" at the beginning and then saying ""thanks guys"" at the end perfectly sums up the teenage attitude while keeping Andy's character.
This entire film happened because of the Toys' decision to go to sunny side and not believe Woody. I see why they wouldn't believe him but at the same time I think they should have given him the benefit of the doubt.
Lotso is an amazing Villain. They don't try to keep it too much of a secret that he is a villain by revealing it within the beginning of the 2nd act. This allowed the film to develop Lotso's evil side so at the end when we see him nearly murder everyone, we understand why. His motivations for taking over Sunny Side make sense because he wants to feel in control of something.
I love the ""Prison break"" scene. I guess it's just me, but seeing elaborate plans in action is really satisfying to me, and this plan was super creative so of course I enjoyed every second and was on the edge of my seat.
The ending is so sad. Not the part where they all almost die, but the part when Andy gives him toys away. Andy has realized that he can make someone else happy with Woody and he doesn't need to keep him for himself. Andy's character is almost a mirror of Woody's in the original. This ending is the perfect ending to this perfect trilogy.
However it isn't, because the 4th one is coming out in a week. I only hope that it has purpose and is a good film. All of the positive reviews I have seen of it give me hope that maybe the 4th one has something interesting to offer.",

She's here again, but she's sidelined quite a bit. The third entry into the franchise has Woody as the focus, and the story naturally progresses as Andy is getting ready to leave for college. It sets up some familiar and some new themes, involving abandonment, friendship, and moving on in life. It's these themes that allow this to be a mature film without disappointing the kids. Plenty of action, lots of laughs, and some great humor, kick this way past the 2nd installment. I didn't feel it was as complete as many have said, nor was the intensity matched by real sacrifice. The film realises that the best thing about the original was Buzz's delusions. So naturally they reintroduce it here as he is ""reset"". I guess I'm not that emotionally attached to this movie because I never gave up my most favourite toys. I believe people crying over this just feel guilty for giving up on their childhood.

Toy Story 3 is the first film I have seen in this new era 3D (Imax 3D to be precise), so perhaps that has given it an extra little edge, but I was once again completely blown away by the rehash of the characters, the narrative, the fabulous story and imaginative script.

Fifteen years later not only do they bring back the characters we know and love but make us love them even more and bring literally the best completion to a trilogy of all time...(Sorry Return of The King fans.) I love sequels personally even when they are bad but I think if they truly end the Toy Story series here they couldn't have done it more brilliantly. This is probably the best movie you'll see in 2010 so far and easily the best movie of the summer. Toy Story has absolutely everything that made the first film so amazing and best of all we see a young boy grow up like so many of us have since the original film and say goodbye to our friends...the toys. Despite a beautiful, moving, emotional, happy ending there is that feeling of sadness and reminiscing of days gone by.

262,5 November 2010,maryszd,10," Love, Loss and Renewal","Toy Story 3 is a beautiful and affecting wrap-up of the Toy Story trilogy. Andy goes off to college, and unlike the girls in most Disney animated films, he actually has a living mother. She's the same age as all of us parents who took our children to the original Toy Story films when they were little. All the Toy Story films have been about the sense of time passing and the inevitable sense of loss that goes along with it. Andy's mom, a single mother is loosing her son and he's ambivalently moving away from her and his childhood, the childhood personified in his beloved toys, especially Woody. The first Toy Story film started with a shot of a cloud-patterned wallpaper in Andy's bedroom. Toy Story 3 begins film ends with the camera panning up into the sky (interestingly, Up ends the same way). The director mentioned during his commentary that this gives the film a ""storybook"" quality, but it also gives it a dimension of mystery and becomes a commentary on the transitory nature of life. It's this sense that gives these wonderful films their resonance and makes us able to watch them again and again. Director Lee Unkrich and Producer Darla Anderson's commentary was excellent; they really went out of their way to give credit to all the individual animators and the work done by everyone at Pixar on the film.

Toy Story 3 from the beginning to the end has very clever storytelling (they better win for screenplay at the Oscars next year), laughs, tears & action thanks to Pixar as is the case with them. This movie is amazing, mix with lots of laughs & tears. The ending will make you cry even if you don't want to, it will make you cry.

The toys find themselves in a conflict rather to stay or leave, they realize they are being forgotten and need to move on or else they'll be thrown away. All toys decide to go to daycare in order to be smaller children's toys except Woody who prefers to stay behind. All toys must work together in order to leave the daycare before it's too late. The ensemble cast of actors voicing in this film is wonderful and an important feature, so is the animation, story and soundtrack. I believe this movie is the perfect one to end the long going story of ""Toy story"", the fourth and final movie of the franchise is more of a new story than a continuation. It was a completely different story from the first three we grew up upon. Overall the third movie of Toy Story is a masterpiece and a must watch to feel good and happy.

The next in line is Toy Story 3 which, quite easily, joins the ranks of Pixar's finest movies (though I'm now struggling to recollect which one wasn't).",
275,12 July 2010,chaaa,9, An emotional roller-coaster,"There's something about the Toy Story franchise that is universally emotive. Presumably that ""something"" is the fact that everyone had toys as a child. Toys taught us how to love. Not loving someone because they are related to us, or because they live on our street and happen to be our age, but because we feel a connection to them. Now, as grown-ups, we all know that toys are only toys and our love is wasted on them. I suppose that's what is so haunting about these films. They remind us all of that part of ourselves that left us many years ago, and dredge up guilty feelings about old Rebecca the Christmas Bear who now sits, dusty in the attic somewhere...if she's lucky. Toy Story 3 deals with just that idea. It is about what happens to the toys when Andy grows up. The film begins with the toys in a typically epic adventure. It is complex, it involves teamwork and it could be dangerous. As it turns out, the toys are plotting a very complicated ploy to get Andy to play with them. He is 19 now, and headed off to college. The toys have been sitting in their chest for years now, without being played with at all. When a chain of events see the toys accidentally donated to a day-care facility, the race is on for the toys to be reunited with their owner before he leaves for college. If the first film was sci-fi, the second was a western then this is a prison movie. Their ""great escape"" is just as exciting and fresh as the previous two outings and certainly just as hilarious. However, what makes this film special is that it balances heartbreak and loss with warm-hearted sentiment so it never feels depressing, but certainly has a sense of tragedy looming throughout. We know there can be no happy ending and that whatever comes our way in the third act will make us sad, but the journey there is so joyous that the tone never gets too blue. Writing about Toy Story 3 is difficult because it is not about the little bits of clever writing and brilliantly realised characters or perfectly balance sense of humour. This film is so much more than the sum of its parts. It accomplishes what so few children's films can. It gives equal pleasure to children and grown-ups. It manages to entertain but also make the audience feel truly invested in the fate of these characters...these toys! No easy task! This is perfect popcorn viewing for all the family and I dare you to sit through this film without at least a small lump in your throat. If this film doesn't make your heart simultaneously jump for joy and burst with emotion, you're made of stone!",
276,27 February 2012,myungjahigh,10, reminds me of my childhood,"Toy story 3 is definitely one of my favorite films ever. I watched toy story 1 and 2 when young, and i didn't have any practical concept about favorites at the time. Hence I would say that Toy story becomes my favorite quite recently. (but i am sure i enjoyed 1&2 a lot) Around the time when I am getting old and getting to forget about first and second series of toy story, i rushed into the theater right after hearing that toy story 3 is released. And some hours later, i found myself crying and this movie became actually one of my best. i must mention about the short but great story called 'day and night' shown before the movie. This brilliant idea and humanism Pixa makes always leads people to their childhood and purity even before the movie really starts. Such a great opening. While toy story 3 went, I could take lost parts of my childhood out to the real. It describes so well all the toys' feelings toward the process that one child who used to be the closest friend of them is actually moving on to a grown up who would not play with them anymore. And the fact that the process is a kind of destiny of human beings make it sadder. However, the film is not filled only with sadness. Of course on the one hand, it is quite tragic that toys got nothing but their human friends, and humans are destined not to take all of their toys to the society. On the other hand, however, it would suggest some ideas that we can possibly see the world in a different way. Toy Story 3 seems to change the trend and stereotype that toys only belong to children. As a genre, animation itself is usually considered as a child's one. but Toy Story 3 shows that grown ups actually can get impressed and enjoyed with all their hearts through animations. Toy Story 3 made me realize there were some moments I fell asleep hugging my toys and dolls. it was so nice and amazing to watch toy story again as an adult with the childhood memories. Another amazing fact! Toy story series itself has passed time and got old with us together. The producers, voice actors, and even the graphics. That might be a reason that people are moved more.",

Most of them have been thrown out because their owner Andy is now grown up and ready to leave home so he can attend college. He must make the difficult decision of deciding what to do with his toys. He contemplates taking Woody with him and leaving the rest of the toys in the attic. After almost being throwing out in the trash however, the toys end up at a day-care center where everything seems blissful and welcoming. Woody realises the realities of the day-care center and is too loyal to Andy to stay behind. He escapes, hoping to get back before his owner can leave for college. The rest of the toys are met by an old teddy bear named Lotso (Ned Beatty) who wants to keep them in line so that they will endure the reckless playtime of the infants who are too young to know how to treat the toys properly. Woody decides that he must return to the day-care center to help his friends escape once again.",

I'm sure that during TOY STORY 3, the smile never really left my face. It was so magical to see these characters back on the big screen again. As I was watching, all I could think about was how much I've missed these characters over the past 11 years.

The supposed ""sad"" ending was Andy's mom crying because her little boy is going to college and this in my opinion felt forced and reminded me of Transformers Revenge of the Fallen with the crazy mom crying over the baby booties and lost all credibility for me, besides the ending was a happy ending with the toys staying with Bonnie who is essentially another Andy instead of staying in the attic and of course Woody never abandoning his friends. Spanish Buzz was funny at first but Jessie being ""turned on"" was ehhh, look at her expression when she is dancing with him at the end credits, awkward.

When I heard that a third movie was in the making, I was so excited. It became the most anticipated movie of 2010 for me. When seeing ""Toy Story 3"", the third and final installment had something that the first two didn't have. A dramatic, heartwarming, and tear-dropping storyline. The movie involved Andy heading for college, and the toys are accidentally sent to a day-care center. While the toys are enjoying their new life in the day care, which is secretly ruled by an evil bear doll named Lotso, portrayed by Ned Beatty, Woody meets some new faces while trying to get back to Andy. Then, the whole movie focuses on trying to get back home and start a new life. During the film, the film teaches the importance of letting go and moving on. The film was actually the best movie in the ""Toy Story"" series. I was amazed on how many times I've laughed and cried, but mostly cried. I couldn't stop thinking about that movie for days. New characters including Michael Keaton as Ken, Jodi Benson as ""Barbie"", and Ned Beatty with his best role as the evil Lotso Bear, really make the movie a lot more special. The story was filled with much heart, and was well-written with comedy and drama. The film took us back to our childhood memories, and brought us to a time when we enjoyed these movies when we were little. That's what made this movie make a billion dollars in the box office this year! With a heartbreaking finale and the return of our beloved friends, this movie is a total must-see.

To me, Toy Story 1 is my favorite Toy Story of them all (which is three). It was a film about the relationship between Andy and his toys, much like Toy Story 2's plot. This story focuses on the relationships but in an abstract way, the toys end up going through an evil, cuddly teddy bear and a garbage incinerator to try return to Andy, who in turns hands over his beloved toys to another young human who he knows will take care of them like he did. For me, the film lacked the humanity that the previous two films had, and tried to make up with through action and humor, though it took away from the characters and emotions.

The film is filled with repeated allusion to old age and finality. Most obviously the film contains direct parallels to (of Divine Comedy fame) paradise, purgatory and inferno in toy form. Second, Lotso's failure and Woody's success revolve around accepting fate and aging (dying ) gracefully.

The creators did not rush into a made for video throw away, but rather looked at the Toy Story mythos and put the characters into a world where they belonged, with the frailties created by the passage of time and different circumstances based on the human component. It is tightly plotted, tugging at our sentiments all the way. It is also uproariously funny. I would stack it against virtually any comedy being made today--a nice departure from the scatological, anything-for-a-laugh stuff that portends to be funny. Don't get me wrong.

326,1 July 2010,arthera09,10, I love Toy Story,"I did not expect a lot from this movie. I went into the movie with the mindset that they could not make 3 great movies with the same characters. I felt that the movie would fall flat and just resort to clichés. The movie felt right in so many ways. The writers took advantage of the fact that there were well established characters with well established relationships with each other. The fact that I grew up with these movies and these characters really made a difference. I was 11 when Toy Story came out and 15 years later it was a perfect progression for the characters. I really saw the characters grow up in unexpected ways, but never in a way that alienated the characters. The landfill scene while action filled was so emotionally charged that it just blew me away. It is rare that an action scene is able to hold so much emotion while keeping the characters in the spotlight. The last 15 minutes with Andy was the best way for the movie to end and really brought together the whole trilogy. The movie was funny, moving and just a good time the whole way through. The movie looked great I really loved the music. Everything came together in the most satisfying way. I cannot wait to own the trilogy and share them with future generations. This movie is destined to be a classic.",

Stories will never stop needing to be told, and there are an infinite number of stories to tell. Still, some stories are so unusual that I find myself unable to conceptualize their creation. Pixar does this, and frequently. I'm amazed that over the past years they have produced stories about a rat that cooks, a robot that cleans garbage, and an old man who floats to South America in his house. All of these sound silly when I describe them to you, but they are told with a great degree of artistry and humanity. They have been some of the best films of their years.",

I hold Toy Story so close to my heart i love it more than most people. I have so many memories from when i watched the first two(and the people i would watch it with). Disney somehow took this warm feeling that i have for these characters, and they made the whole movie about those feelings.

What is truly remarkable is how simple the first Toy Story is as a landmark animation, and how both sequels manage to improve using deep impression themes. Andy is grown up and ready for college but his toys get misplaced on the way to the attic and are shipped off to Sunnyside Daycare. They are greeted with the pains of toddlers before being greeted by Lotso the stuffed bear. Directed by Lee Unkrich with glorious images throughout as well as a comical yet suspenseful screenplay. There is many references to prison movies that are amusing. Tom Hanks again voices Woody the cowboy who breaks out of Sunnyside to go to college with Andy but soon realizes that his friends are in dire need of help. Tim Allen again voices Buzz Lightyear who ends up a prisoner in Sunnyside and whose batteries are switched around to a comical effect. Ned Beatty is the perfect voice of Lotso with his own backstory on how he came to land in Sunnyside. Michael Keaton voices Ken who gushes over Barbie. This is hilarious especially when trust is violated and Barbie decides to take matters into her own hands. Joan Cusack is great voicing Jessie who discovers that Buzz has language buttons that bring about different personas. There is a strong theme regarding friendship and how life's difficulties are easier faced when not alone. Pixar once again creates a winner and for a second sequel, that is an amazing accomplishment. Score: 9 / 10",

Once again, the film delivers a very strong central character arc and is dipped, from head to toe, in theme. It's this thematic resonance that really gives it its impact, even more so than in prior entries. There's not as much comedy, despite the odd chuckle, and things don't really get 'fun' until the flick dives into prison-break territory. Still, it's a satisfying story in and of itself, as well as being a pitch-perfect conclusion (yes, conclusion) to a fifteen-year-old franchise. It truly nails its ending, earning every drop of its audience's inevitable, bittersweet tears. Overall, the piece is entertaining, energetic and emotional. It's, essentially, as well a crafted an experience as Pixar has ever put together - even if the comeuppance given to its downright despicable villain is frustratingly tame. 9/10",

Its universal achievement is its study of loss and post-script look at the fact that life does indeed go on after whatever tragedy might have previously befallen you. Here is the third film in a franchise which has stuck to its guns; providing more than mere blunt nostalgia and petty summer frills to an array of fans young enough to remember the first one as a wondrous animated adventure film, by effectively branching out in its overall study of something substantial; simultaneously refraining to pander to new generations of youngsters out for shrill entertainment in a CG animated form. The film is one very much for those whom have grown up with the characters and in-jokes; twelve year old newcomers out for the latest in commodity infused sequel shenanigans whom are not familiar with the other two need not apply.",

From the first frame itself, the movie sets into sublime motion with one scene simply flowing into the other. The audience gets introduced to all the old familiar faces - the Potato Heads, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy bank, the aliens, Slinky the dog, Jesse and of course, Woody and Buzz Lightyear. Andy's all grown up now and headed to college and the Toys are left guessing as to their fate now that Andy won't be interested in playing with them anymore. Woody, always the loyal one, tries his best to convince them that Andy won't discard them, but the others don't believe him. What follows is another typical 'Toy Story' adventure with the toys experiencing the supposed thrills and chills of being toys to kids in a Day Care, imprisoned in what they believed to be their new wonderland and Woody, as always, is there to save the day. Toy Story 3 also brings to the fore a host of new characters including Barbie, Ken, Lotso and Big Baby to name a few.",
382,24 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9, Toy Story 3 proves that some acclaimed films deserve sequels.,"This. THIS. This is what I wanted, and boy...I got it. At first I was worried Pixar may have milked this series just for a quick cash grab, but they continue to surprise me. This really was magnificent. Woody and the gang are now stored away, no longer played with due to Andy now grown up and moving to college. They accidentally get donated to a local daycare centre which is ruled by a ""cute but not so cute"" huggable bear. So the toys try to escape and return to Andy. Now this film is a prime example why child-friendly animations can be just as entertaining and emotionally captivating for the mature audiences. Especially those like me who grew up with the previous 'Toy Story' films, and Pixar know this better than anyone else. There is an ever present underlying sense of nostalgia riddled throughout this animated feature. Rehashed quotes and catchphrases, flashbacks, call back humour and even visual Easter eggs. It's just a pleasure to watch really. It's a story about growing up, having to part with objects and memories that have accumulated a sense of sentimentality. Making the difficult choice to let go and move on. It's beautifully told, both in the script and animation. It's breathtakingly vibrant and highlights what this franchise has done, not just for Pixar, but for CGI animation it its entirety. The characters were full of life, the new additions were memorable enough albeit had very limited screen time unfortunately. The inner dynamics between the group of toys were fully expressed where both conflict and cooperation were explored. A few goofy scenes for younger audiences, like Buzz dancing the flamenco whilst in Spanish mode, to ensure laughter is had all round. One scene though...actually make it two, just poured pure emotion. When the toys are holding hands, and when Andy departs. It's so simple yet incredibly effective. It never ceases to amaze me, but 'Toy Story' may just be the best animated franchise of all time. Please Pixar, do not make anymore...you risk spoiling its legacy.",

They are now starting to feel left out, and after a misunderstanding by the mother, wind up in a ""retirement home for toys"" headed up by Lotso-well voiced by Ned Beatty. Things seem pleasant enough. Unfortunately, things aren't what they seem, especially Lotso. Woody escapes to be back with Andy, but then has to go back to get the other toys and rescue them. This is overall a terrific film and a worthy entry in a great Disney series. I recommend it to anyone who likes Disney films and computer generated movies.

Now, after a triumphant sequel and several other wonderful Pixar adventures, Andy is seventeen years old and on his way to college. I myself am now twenty, and heading towards my junior year of college. It suddenly struck me just how personal the Toy Story saga was to me when i was sitting in the theater watching Toy Story 3 this afternoon. Woody, Buzz, and all of their plastic pals have been with Andy for as long as he can remember, and I realized that they have been with me for as long as I can remember as well. Needless to say this movie needed that extra personal touch to really deliver, and let me tell you that it did not disappoint.

This movie provides the audience with all kinds of assortments, superb technical details, laughs left and right, surprise plot twists and a heavy dose of nostalgia, my beloved wife was sniffling as usual. The folks from Pixar are gifted people who for over 15 years have managed to pull off what the audience like to see. Their products all have been hits because their dedication to every detail and commitment to quality has made them a big name in the industry. TS3 could easily be considered the best in the trilogy, just like Star Wars III did in year 2005. Simply it is flawless, the studios have perfected an already outstanding theme. What I like the most of TS3 is that the story although a bit predictable, still knows how to pull the right strings into making an engaging movie packed with emotion that can compare to real life experiences as well.

Sequels are met with sighs, gasps, cheers, dollar signs and more than often ""wtf?"" This is because sequels notoriously never quite (or at all) live up to their originals, it is a sad fact that some of your favourite films have more than likely be ruined by inferior siblings. Films such as Speed 2: Cruise Control and Ocean's Twelve spring to mind as two films that we could all do without ever seeing and no doubt omitted from numerous stars résumés. The secret lies in recreating the magic that made the 1st film such a hit and for many directors, writers and studios it is something they all too frequently fail to achieve. There are exceptions to the rules, as ever, and every so often sequels manage to muster together enough cinema gold and give birth to a sequel that is on par with its older sibling and on that rare special occasion a sequel that I dare say is better than its predecessor. Films such Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Aliens, Clerks 2 and X2, have all shown that sequels can be just as good or even better than their originals. Further down the line the dreaded threequel and numerous non-direct sequels plague the video-store shelves covered in dust and outlandish quotes engraved on the cover claiming to be ""better than the original"" or ""if you loved Mega Piranha, you are going to love this"". They are an inevitable evil in this world that tarnish the name of its forbearer that we must live with, Shrek The Third, Spider-Man 3, Stars Wars: The Phantom (JarJarYouAlmostRuinedStarWarsBinks) Menace, The Godfather 3, Alien Resurrection etc, a horrible list that goes on and on. Which brings me somewhat fittingly to the matter of Toy Story 3, a sequel, a threequel , so is it any good?

A three-film journey is complete and what a ride it's been.

But Toy story series has always a step up from the norm, and I must admit that this is one of the very best second sequels out there. This is a charming, funny, sweet, sharply clever action filled adventure filled with so many great characters (the big baby doll is genuinely creepy at times) , and it has more than a little touch of weepiness towards the end. The sense of passing youth and time in general is sublimely well crafted, and throughout this is hugely entertaining. All in all a great addition to family cinema.",

It is a brilliant thinking to add daycare center to the storyline as a new setting. I am not a fan of sequel unless it is designed to be made before the original. In any other cases, whether or not the original is success, the story of sequel is 'added' to the finished one, making it very difficult to look plausible and natural. Plus, many sequels repeat what's been said and done before. However, third Toy Story is a whole another one with adored and familiar characters; it would be harder to be a failure. Animation quality is just next level even after 10 years. Each character distinctive of personalities, looks, and voices is just so wholesome and fun to watch.",

When I heard that this film was going to come into fruition, I was excited. Finally after 11 years, the long awaited sequel was going to come out! However, I did worry a little. When I walked into the theater, I was filled with high expectations. Most Pixar films fill these expectations of a great animated film(except for the depressing Incredibles and stupid Cars), but Toy Story 3 was a different case. It not only exceeded my expectations, now I am going to expect much more from Pixar. The movie is simply hilarious. Sadly, some of the characters were not in this one, but we do have the main ones, and that's the important thing. This film is not only the funniest in the trilogy, it is also the darkest. Some of the plot seemed like a rehash of the second, but done is such a way that you don't really realize it or just don't care. This is also one of the few animated films where I teared up a bit. The ending is just perfect, and that is how it should end. I would say that Toy Story is the greatest trilogy in film history.",

From the story to the animation, it was amazing. It has been 15 years since the first movie. I loved all the toy story movies, it has been a part of my childhood. And i love Pixar films, since the first Pixar film to the latest one, i loved it and toy story 3 is definitely in my top 3 best Pixar films. It's so refreshing to see the characters again, and with the animation they look so much better. Toy story 3 has set the bar high, it is emotional (especially at the end). The ending part is totally my favorite (i cried like a baby). This movie is about friendship and letting go of things that are important to us. So for anyone who is looking for a film that will touch your heart, definitely watch this! it will not disappoint you. Pixar makes the best movies out there! I recommend this film to everybody! 10/10 stars!",

All the lovable characters are back and the film has the right balance of humour mixed with a tinge of sadness. Some scenes were very sad and effective for example the ending when Andy gives the toys to the little girl Bonnie , it nearly made me cry and I consider myself quite a tough cookie! Also the part when the toys hold hands when they think they are about to be burnt and die , in the tip. The humour was strong throughout the film, I particularly liked Spanish Buzz Lightyear and the Ken doll was exactly how i would imagine him if the doll came to life. The animation and visuals were great , as expected from Pixar. The toys looked so real I felt like I could actually reach out and feel the texture on the toys.

Toy Story 3 is darker, more sober and more mature - the film and its motifs intentionally grew up with its viewers, just like Andy did, and for anyone in my age group - anyone who was a kid when the first film came out and is now in their 20's - it's very relevant and extremely effective, not to say that it's not also whimsical and hysterically funny.

You relate to the toys in a way that's humane, and they speak of the tenderness and true loyalty of friendship with a childlike understanding and communicates directly to the heart for any open-minded viewer.

I wonder the same thing as I walked into the theater. Now, while the third movie in a trilogy is never good (with few exceptions) the wizards at Pixar have puled yet another winner out of their hat. Never have I been more entertained, touched, or learned more from an animated movie. This is the movie which not only all animated adventures be judged against, but all family movies. Toy Story 3 is a remarkable movie that will make you laugh and perhaps even cry. The script is extremely witty for the most parts, most of it aimed at adults. The voice cast is fabulous and the new characters fit in like a fish to water. All of the ""core characters"" (Woody, Buzz, etc.) complete their ""character arc"" becoming some of the most dynamic characters in recent memory. The actual animations have received a major overhaul, and are now some of the most beautiful computer-generated graphics ever. Using the lush, glow seen in Ratatouille and much darker, shadowy lighting that you would expect in the Godfather, Toy Story 3 generates as much tension as possible. Toy Story was is one of the most beloved movies ever. Toy Story 2 matched the original in all regards. Toy Story 3 however leaves them all behind.

Andy is now ready to go to University and has left his toys untouched for many years. Now that he's about to leave his parental home the question arises what to do with the toys. Will it be the safety of the attic, or the trash-can or some other fate? To me this film was tilted just a bit towards the audience of the first film and no longer really towards the kids in the audience.

The ""film"" poster is one of the most accurate I've seen for any movie. All of the characters faces match my natural expressions while viewing this ""film"". Well done! Why did they make this ""movie""? Seriously, why did they? It adds nothing to the first two ""Toy Story"" movies. They must have made it for monetary purposes, that's probably the only logical explanation. I didn't ask for this ""movie"" and neither did anyone else! It has a weak story, boring locations and a lazily edited soundtrack. As far as the storyline goes, it's one of the most cliched plots I have ever seen in an animated movie. I honestly predicted everything that happened throughout, including the ending! Which, I will not go into any details about, at the risk of spoiling it for those lucky souls who haven't had to sit through this ""movie"". Really, the ending is one I saw on the horizon since practically the beginning of the ""film"". In my head, I was thinking: ""yeah, didn't see that coming!"" Aside from the cliched layout, all of the jokes fall flat and I almost fell asleep multiple times! The locations, which I can't refer to them as sets since this is an animated film, are dull. Well, I suppose it matches the tone of the ""movie"" though, dull and boring! So they work, for all the wrong reasons. The soundtrack is okay in some scenes, but it adds nothing new or fresh to the plot. Once again, we have a soundtrack that sounds like it was added in at the last minute. Film Making 101: editing should be seamless. When you notice the editing, then something is very wrong. Now for the positives, yes, there are some positives I can salvage out of this ""movie"". The voice acting is spot-on and the animation is impeccable. All of the voice actors returned to voice their respectable characters, except for Jim Varney. Unfortunately, he died back in 2000, (R.I.P.) So, someone else had to do the voice of Slinky, that man is Blake Clark. Who honestly, did a fairly decent job. It did sound a little different, but overall, it was almost pitch-perfect. As for the rest of the cast, they all do a fantastic job with the voices without missing a beat. ""Toy Story 3"" is a major disappointment in the world of Pixar films. Is it their worst film? Absolutely not, there are a few that are worse. At the end of the day, I'm struggling to give ""Toy Story 3"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stick with ""Toy Story"" (1995) and ""Toy Story 2"" (1999) instead. Those are the real ""Toy Story"" films!",

The big question of the movie is: to what extent should you be loyal to people of your past versus moving on and doing what's best for the individuals? In the end, Toy Story 3 falls somewhere in the middle, as the toys realize they should not have doubted Andy, but at the end Andy accepts that he's ready to move on and give them to a new owner who will love them. Along the way, we have a dark day care hierarchy and a fun heist-style escape from the center. Friendship wins out once again, and the ending both with all the garbage drama and with Andy giving Bonnie his toys was excellent. I'm not sure I enjoyed the plot quite as much as the previous movie, but the wonderful ending makes up for it and keeps Toy Story 3 fresh and right in line with the excellence the series has proven time and time and now time again.",

I geeked out at the 3D re-release of the first two movies (giving me a chance to finally see every Pixar movie on the big screen). And the day finally came for the film to arrive. I wasn't too impressed by Day and Night; the short that precedes it. It just amused me at best, not among Pixar's best. That didn't bode well for the third Toy Story. Would it be great? Good? Average? Or even... terrible? Could it be Pixar's first complete stinker? Yet, all doubt of the film's quality slipped out of my mind after those first amazing seven-minutes, showing the joys and imagination of childhood at their best. The film really shows you how old we've gotten, through the technology, Molly, his mother, but mostly through Buster (he got a good laugh out of me).",

I dare saying Toy Story 3 might be the most anticipated western animation movie of all time. Usually this kind of anticipation comes at the price of disappointment. So what about this movie? The Incredibles is probably my favorite Pixar movie. Mostly because i love the characters so much. For me Ratatouille was the best so far. It just captured that magical Disney feeling so well. Wall-E and Up were excellent, but the first half of these movies was so strong, the end just didn't make that much of an impact and was a little lost in the shadow. So where does Toy Story 3 fit in? Toy Story 3 just set another bar for perfection. There is simply not one thing to hate or even dislike about this movie. At the beginning it was obvious we're not just watching another animation movie, but a 200 million dollar Pixar heavy weight champ. The highly impressive action captures the audience immediately and the movie never lets it slip. I couldn't find a few minutes where the movie got boring, if only a little.",
497,5 December 2011,estreet-eva,5, Paint-by-numbers Di$ney animation product.,"With their human going off to a noticeably generically-referred to ""college"", the now-idle toys mistakenly get shipped to a ""Cool Hand Luke"" prison-camp like daycare center. Hilarity generally does not ensue. A Big Wheel-sized amount of suspension-of-disbelief is needed to accept that somehow the Ned Beatty-voiced strawberry-scented Care Bear runs the prison, er, daycare, such that Woody & Co. are trapped in the toddlers room where they are tortured, er, played with. Since it was hard to accept the idea that the human day care mavens somehow couldn't simply put the toys into whatever room they wanted, I spent the time in the theater's darkness trying to develop a theory that the film was a veiled protest against secret CIA black-ops prisons. Given that the Patriot Act is still in effect, I will refrain from relating my ruminations on the subject. Anyway, the film has an intriguing voice cast such that it is populated deep into the character list with former actors who could open a film in their time. Also Don Rickles is in it. The script is passable with a reasonable amount of pathos for the younger target demographic but it lacks the winking adult-targeted asides such as those found in ""Monsters, Inc."" There is an attempt at this with the Ken doll trying to defend against charges of being a girl's toy but it never goes anywhere. This being Pixar, the animation is technically top-notch, however, since the toys-coming-to-life thrill is now some 15 years old, Disney must rely on the audience being too young to have encountered the conceit before. In short, this one goes into the over-rated Pixar films bin next to ""Finding Nemo"", and ""Ratatouille"" rather than into the Pixar classics bin which includes in this order: ""Wall-E"", ""Monsters, Inc"", ""The Incredibles"", ""Cars"" and ""Up"".",

Pixar absolutely knows how to touch our hearts with their movies. And that's what Toy Story 3 did. It's humorous, suspenseful, and emotional. Not to mention the Nostalgic Music they still kept from the previous two movies. This goes to show that movies don't need to be vulgar, and gory to be epic as this movie was.

Toy Story 3 delivers the most vast experience through multiple themes of aging, family, duty, self awareness and resolution. Our toy friends are mostly all back and they stay true to their character, while clever writing literally reprograms another. When faced with their challenge of survival, each point is thoughtfully made and yet we have a difference of opinion. They are splitting up themselves, not by an act of an outside force or circumstance. This was the best of the film. Kids learn to review their thoughts and that we are all fallible and we all change. Wonderful. Our ending is way more tense that I would have liked (did anyone else think of The Holocaust?) but the experience has its merits if not for pushing us to the edge.

Everyone knows that no sequel ever matches up to its predecessor, and that being said, I would like to say that while I enjoyed it more than Toy Story 2, it wasn't as good as Toy Story. But it was a very close call. I loved this movie. Even as a teen, I still felt for the toys. And while I must admit that Lotso the evil mastermind bear, the monkey security guard, the baby doll, and even the clown toy (I've always been afraid of clowns) scared me, but all Disney movies have to have a villain. I have to say, after a few people in the audience started to clap, I started clapping too. Soon the whole theater was erupting in cheer. It was then that I knew, and after wards when a lady behind me called her friend to tell her that she just HAD to see the movie, that Toy Story 3 would be a great hit and widely renowned. Roger Ebert, from the Chicago Sun Times, even gave the movie three stars, and I must say, he is a pretty hard critic to impress. Now while I love when he trashes movies (he's my go-to critic, normally, even though I don't live in Chicago, and when he trashes a movie it can be hilarious), I liked to see that this movie did well on his scale. Because I knew then also that it would be liked. And I think I was correct. Now let me bore you with the plot of this kid-attracting movie. Basically Andy is all grown up now, and he's going off to college. His mom (y'know, I never really liked her) guilted him into putting his old toys away in the attic. Except for Woody, who, lucky him, gets to go to college with Andy. But there's just one little problem. The toys, like most, I would expect, are selfish and just want to be loved and played with again, so after a close call with a trash truck, they decide to put themselves in a box of old toys up for donation at Sunnyside Day Care Center. Oh, if only they knew. Well, Sunnyside is run by the huggable bear Lotso, who turns out to be not-so-lovable, as we learn later on. Woody decides he belongs to Andy, and he won't desert him, so he leaves the toys at the day care. Oh, if only he knew, too. Now, I won't reveal the end to you, or the rest of plot. Of course, since this is a children's movie, and only rated PG, it has a happy ending. Since I'm not going to tell you, well, you'll just have to see it for yourself.

Anyways, I've waited 11 years for this moment, and its finally here. And I have to say, Toy Story 3 surprised me. In a good way. I never knew that an animation movie can consist such emotions, and still be child friendly. I would have to say, Toy Story 3 is way more mature than the first two movies, so little kids won't understand the more mature feeling Toy Story 3 provides. However, this movie still has the old Toy Story atmosphere, the personalities of the different toys. This movie is actually amazingly funny, too, my friends and I were bursting into laughter at Ken's letter. So for all you people out there, this is not the movie you would want to miss.

I'm very happy that toys can have new owners, treat them well and cherish their owners. Andy is really a good host. It's a waste to put it in the attic, let Bonnie help take care of them. There are new friends. Sunshine kindergarten is not sunny at all, and children do not know how to cherish toys and destroy them. The pink bear didn't expect to be so obsessed, the hatred was too deep, people saved you, but you avenged the hatred and deserved it. When it was clear that the button could be pressed but not pressed, I was really disappointed and disheartened. It vented its dissatisfaction with its owner on other toys, engaged in unfair class rule, and cheated on the doll. It is too selfish to let other toys go back, and it is difficult to imagine how much hardship they have experienced before returning home, only to find that the owner has found a new toy. The prison break of Sunshine Kindergarten is very exciting, and the seemingly beautiful places are also oppressive and dark. The period of changing clothes between Barbie and the male doll is very interesting. It reminds me that I particularly like to change clothes for the baby when I was young. The life and death of the junkyard, the three alien dolls are awesome, Buzz Lightyear matches Tracy as well, and Spanish Buzz is also interesting. Woody is smart and open-minded. When everyone was holding hands together to face the fire, they felt particularly tragic and not so afraid. This is the power of group unity. The friendship between toys is much deeper than I thought. I really hope that each of my toys is conscious and can choose its own owner or life. I have n't played with toys for a long time. At most, I hugged the dolls by the bed. My childhood is farther and farther away from me. My childlike hope is still there. I use children's imagination to give toys special meaning.",

Then I re-watched it with a friend when I was about 16(I was almost 12 when this released) and realized it was not as appealing. looking back, it was mainly for the potty humor.""Watch out for puddles."" ""I don't think those were Lincoln Logs."" The escape from the bathroom scene. So that's why I give it an 8. But it still is a good movie and it is definitely worth watching!Fun Fact: This was nominated for Best Picture. The only other animated films to get BP nominations are Beauty and the Beast(1991) and Up(2009).",

Toy Story captured the imagination and was the perfect family film combining adult (hey ham look i'm picasso....what 6 year old knows picasso) and child-like humour which made it a must see for parents and their children. One of the great things about the toys was how the characters all demonstrate human emotions giving the audience more empathy for them. ",

I went to this movie expecting to be disappointed, the first two movies were so good and usually sequels disappoint. However this movie blew my expectations out of the water. It was funny, cute, it had very emotional and sad parts making it almost a tear jerker. Then it swings back in and kills with a beautiful ending. They stayed true to the first two movies and kept everything perfect. They new toys at the daycare bring a fun new twist to the plot. The toys have been alone for so long with only Jessie and Bulls Eye being added that the introduction of the new toys was crucial. Woody and Buzz and the whole gang's friendship is great and really makes the movie inspirational. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a feel good flick! :)",

It was unbelievable adventure and just pure enjoyment to watch Woody and rest of toys get set up many obstacles in their plan to return to Andy. Plot was absolutely perfectly written and amazingly intelligent with some great twists and unexpected moments. So many amazing scenes with a perfect balance between expected and unexpected and great ways to turn toys into a clever things that never run out of ideas. Once more Woody goes through a tough period and a lot of doubts but finally decides to stay with his friends and Andy allowed him in the brilliant ending where he plays with for the last time and leaves them in a very good hands of Bonnie. Woody watches Andy leaving on porch was a great ending of a magnificent third part. Toy story 3 surpasses even Toy story in some ways as being more interesting. 4/4,

The opening was cool and epic, the main part was exciting and entertaining, and the ending was just heartbreaking, but perfect. The story about toys who are being let go by their owner, their home after many years, is a big part of the toys' lives. Either they get kept in storage, given away, or thrown in the trash. It's always difficult to choose. I think it was a good choice by Andy to give his toys away to someone he knew a little, like Bonny. The journey of the toys are not over just because you don't have any use for them anymore, but they can carry on with a new player, a child who has just begun his/her life. Then the toys can keep on going, and be played with just like before.",

It was darker than I think anyone expected, the villain was creepy, the plot was a masterpiece, and the ending was tear-jerking. I also think his is the movie that fully showed the strong relationship with Buzz and Jessie, thanks to this movie I ship them, the previous movie did good with them too but there was only a scene or two that showed that relationship.

563,1 January 2020,RhapsodyReviews,10, Perfect Trilogy.,"Review:
'Toy Story 3' is a computer-animated comedy film directed by Lee Unkrich. It is the third installment in Pixar's 'Toy Story' series.
Pretending that 'Toy Story 4' doesn't exist for a moment, this series could have gone down in history as one of the best Trilogies of all-time. I've seen 'Toy Story 4', it's good and will post a review for that movie in the future, but this movie is special to me.
The plot focuses on Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), and Andy's other remaining toys accidentally being donated to a day care center, while Andy, now 17 years old, is preparing to leave for college, and their ensuing race to get home before Andy leaves.
After 10 years of not seeing or hearing from these characters we all know and love, the actors portraying these characters don't miss a beat lending their voices brilliantly to bring them back to life. Ned Beatty and Michael Keaton were great addition to the already loveable cast and seemed welcomed.
This is an amazing film, and a would have been fitting end to a wonderful film series that started in 1995 with the first 'Toy Story'. The animation has come a long way from the original bringing the colors more to life.
Overall, there isn't anything I dislike about this movie. It's fun, funny and has heart all throughout. It shows us that things are meant to change and that's not always bad.

569,7 November 2022,ForTheMostPart1999,10, It may possibly be the best out of the series,"There's quite easily nothing better out of the entire Pixar collection than any of the Toy Story movies so far. It's quite incredible that after all these years, the voice cast of the classic characters still sound pretty much exactly like they did in the previous films. Andy is grown up, and Woody and the gang must stick together for as long as possible. They are eventually reunited with a new owner that has quite the similar playing style as Andy did back then. The movie starts out with a clever intro, a crazy fun and suspenseful middle, and probably the most heartwarming end you could ever see out of almost any film (animated especially). It also has quite the record of new fun and bright characters, including Ken, Barbie, Buttercup, Trixie and more. Each Toy Story film has shown that there's always a child inside all of us no matter how old we are, and Toy Story 3 I would have to say shows it off almost the most. With all the areas of the daycare and a load of the bright new characters, this is probably the most colorful film out of the series. Truly Pixar's greatest moment since their beginning.",

We were soon joined by a group of friends, all eager to see the movie. When we got into the theater and found our seats I was, admittedly, not feeling all that excited. Still, I had no doubts that it would be amazing; it's PIXAR, after all, and I had been following the movie closely basically since it was announced and had seen no reason to believe otherwise. Yet the excitement was still lacking. As I watched people begin to fill the theater, the thrill slowly began to wash over me, but it wasn't until I saw three girls walk in, each holding a different toy from Toy Story that it really hit me.

The end was the saddest part of the whole movie, I admit I shed a slight tear because it reminded me that growing up has it's perks but also it's downs. One of it's downs is that you start to miss the good old days where you felt like you can do anything and that you cant enjoy your toys like you used to. Anyways besides the sadness Toy Story 3 is an instant classic. Probably the best movie of the year and best movie of the summer of 2010.

Why don't they just tell the story without trying so hard to win the audience over. It goes out of its way to try to make you cry and piles it on thick. There's too much of everything in this one.

598,21 June 2010,gregyolen,9," TS3: Darker, and Better Than Its Predecessors","What's most wonderful about TOY STORY 3, and what sets it apart from the rest of the series, is how it approaches the character of Andy, the kid who was given Buzz Lightyear for his seventh birthday back when nobody had ever heard of Pixar in 1995. Andy's always been a sweet kid, a kid worth the loyalty of Woody, Buzz and the gang, but beyond that, he's been, well, a kid. As we catch up to him in part three, however, Andy's leaving home for college, and his choice of what to do with his toys – bring them, store them in the attic, or trash them – frames the story. The film's insight into Andy proves its best asset, because unlike parts one and two, the toys in this final chapter have a complex relationship with their owner, and their journey is not about simply getting back to him at all costs. It's about the question of where a toy's place in the world is – where it has value, and when. That the end of childhood is the jumping off point for this series capstone makes it not only the darkest of the three, but the most rewarding, at least for a former kid. If you are one, you will more or less love this movie.",
599,27 June 2010,jonnyfendi,8, Thiz Toy Is A Winner,"I always believe that ""Toy Story"" in 1995 was the first brick of Pixar's grandiose castle. 15 years go by, Pixar becomes more stronger and creative, not just in technology innovation but also for the story. Now, for carrying their important icon in ""Toy Story 3"", of course they will bring out the best of them. Two earlier prequels include ""Toy Story 2"" in 1999 was directed by John Lasseter. But for thiz reunion, the Director is replaced by Lee Unkrich, the former Co-Director from ""Monster, Inc."" (2001) and my favorite Pixar of all-time ""Finding Nemo"" (2003). It tells 17-year-old Andy will go to the college soon, now all his beloved toys are in jeopardy. They face a dilemma which is the toys will be given away to charity or being dump in attic. The familiar characters almost share in equal proportion, whether the cowboys Woody (Tom Hanks) and Jessie (Joan Cusack), the space ranger Buzz (Tim Allen), the fussy Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, the dumb dinosaur Rex, the follower Slinky Dog, the pinky piggy Hamm and three little green Aliens, plus introducing new foe, strawberry-scented huggin' bear called Lotso with his vicious gang. In overall, thiz movie is filled with well-arranged story and fun dialogue. From the opening scene, the adventure already rolls with explosive action scenes. The story-telling is very fast, there is almost no breathing room. I almost think that thiz movie is just similar to the prequels before. But something more happens, the ending shocks me. The power of thiz movie is definitely on its 15 minutes of ending (Spoiler Alert!), when Andy passes all his toys to neighbor's kid, Bonnie. He introduces one by one his toys and plays with her. That heartwarming scene is so touching. The ending has made thiz toys a winner. Once again, Pixar takes us to a new height with its winning theme, to infinity and beyond! ",

Especially as someone who is quickly facing ""the end of their childhood"", this movie really hit home for me. I don't know how Pixar manages to make all of these incredible films, but it definitely succeeded with this one. In addition, it really is a film for all ages, although it may be directed most to those around my age, those of us who grew up with the trilogy. In the theater, I was surrounded by young children laughing and old couples who went without their children, proving that this really is a universal film that can resonate with everyone. :)",

The only thing dissatisfied me was the 3-D glasses, Pixar does not need that technology to make its works perfect, and once again. I reviewed the others toy stories right after I came back from the theater and finally convinced myself that no one on the earth could make plastic toys strike adults again and again. I was a teenager when toy story 1 was on TV in China. The sequels amuse children for they are really funny, but express further more towards elder people. When we grow older, people will find out that so many beautiful things are gone and affections fade away. Like Andy I put behind most of my toys before going to college, unfortunately I do not have a Woody to recover me.. Although I didn't cry during toy story 3, I was totally overwhelmed for Pixar did another excellent job. WALL-E and Up surprise me so much that I can not believe Pixar is able to do better.The truth is toy story 3 is the best. Pixar gives us lessons about how to innovate and carry out those innovations.

610,27 May 2016,datautisticgamer-74853,9, Can it be? A third movie that happens to be the trilogy's best?,"That's right: I personally find Toy Story 3 to be my favorite movie in the Toy Story trilogy. The animation, as expected in 2010 compared to the 1990s, is better (though should that matter?), the characters are either already classic or feel classic upon being introduced to make them both seem recognizable and just met. The story isn't terribly original, as I noticed some elements recycled from Toy Story 2, but since this movie went in a different direction, the execution of it went differently and better in plenty of ways; there were less tedious moments and more emotion being doled out by the plot, including one of the best endings I have seen in an animated movie (up there with The Fox and The Hound). And yet, somehow, it's the one Toy Story film so far to not get 100% on Rotten Tomatoes (99%, thanks to Armond White and 3 other critics). After watching the original film as toddlers, plenty of more adult people in the audience will think back to that time and relate to it. While I have yet to do that, the emotional impact of it all is so strong that it was one of the movies that I cried while watching. You just might as well, especially if you are at a pivotal point in your life. But the real tearjerker is that this would be Pixar's final film before they fell into a Dark Age of their own (as Disney parasitized off them and made themselves a Second Renaissance).",

613,4 January 2011,psofronas,10, Not G rated,"Toy Story was the first movie i ever saw in theaters back in 1996. I've waited 11 years for this to come out and its been a great disappointment. If you've seen any commercial for this movie (except for the Superbowl commercial) you know everything that's going to happen. You know that the toys are going to get donated, they day care seems nice, then the kids turn out to be destructive toddlers and the other toys are evil, woody turns away from everyone else like he does in every other movie. but several plot points in the movie are not appropriate for small children, which the movie is rated for. The movie revolves around how the toys try to escape a Nazi-esquire gang of toys who for some reason are bent on keeping toys from escaping daycare and all of their motives are never determined. Also some parts of the movie are things that fuel kids nightmares. The movie is very dark, grim, and suspenseful especially near the end. The chatter-monkey cymbal banging thing is a demon- like saw trap. He's loud, frightening, performs shock scenes, and his appearance can scare people. Also when woody is sneaking around outside and gets the babies' attention, it performs a silent hill worthy head turning scene like that of which you'd see in the exorcist. Also the baby itself is like Frankenstein because its face is scarred up. Finally the relationship between Barbie and ken has a lot of adult themes such as flirting and other not G rated stuff. Also, the way they portray ken makes him either gay or a transvestite. He acts extremely feminine and most of the other characters treat him like so. The movie itself is extremely obvious, and anyone can tell what's going to happen probably because its exactly like any other jail escape movie. I'm not saying don't see it, just try not to let anyone under the age of 10 see.",

617,3 November 2015,joshuafagan-64214,10, A Fulfilling Symphony of the Heart,"From the release of Toy Story 2 in 1999, Pixar went on an unprecedented creative streak. All of their films- Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, the Incredibles, and so on, became unprecedented critical and commercial successes. And they were all original films. In the face of the tide of franchises that conquered the first decade of the two thousands, it was a breath of fresh air and a pulse of creativity that rang throughout Hollywood and beyond. Wow, new and creative and well-done films could perform just as well if not better at the box office than massive, overblown, CGI-fests? Who knew? All of these films have and will form the fabric of many a kid's childhood. They are the kind of movies that last. Perhaps the movie scene of the 2000s did not deserve these films, but it certainly needed them. As soon as (main-branch) Disney animation went down, Pixar rose to claim the now-empty Western animation podium. For that and for much more, it has gained deserved respect.",

The 10 year level up in animation quality is apparent from the rain, furniture and human character faces.

622,20 June 2010,musicday1094,10, Toy Story 3 will be remembered,"When I first learned of a third entry to the Toy Story series, I was on IMDb looking up some information from one of the earlier Toy Story titles. When looking up either Toy Story or Toy Story 2, my eyes saw a link to a Toy Story 3 page, set for 2010. When I saw this, I was both excited and a bit worried. I would once again see my favorite toys up on the big screen in an all new adventure, however I was skeptical as to how well this could be pulled off. Even though it was Pixar working on the film, I had trouble seeing just how a good third Toy Story could be made. Take the Shrek franchise for instance; Shrek the Third was not only unnecessary, but also not a very good movie in the first place. Well, the years went by and I finally saw a trailer for the Pixar film; it nearly moved me to tears. The idea that Andy was moving away, leaving the Toys behind was enough to make me pre-order my tickets. I thought it was a great story line. However, as the date for the moving got closer and closer, I was a bit upset with how they revealed much of the plot through their YouTube page. They talked about how the day-care was not what the toys originally thought it was going to be, and how there was going to be a prison escape. Then I actually saw the film, and was blown away. Pixar did not reveal an eighth of the story as I had feared they did. The animation, the story, and so much more all come together to make not only the perfect third entry to a franchise, but the perfect ending of a trilogy. The Toy Story trilogy is now complete, and it feels that way. This movie will be remembered, and it deserves not only the 9.4/10 that it currently stands on IMDb, but the 100% it hold at RT. I applaud Pixar for this amazing film, and can not wait to see what they do next.",
623,26 May 2023,atleverton,9, Should have been the end,"So in the first and second Toy Story there is this idea that the thing that truly terrifies the character of Woody the most is how his relationship with Andy the boy who owns him is going to continue after Andy grows up. In this film we actually see what happens when Andy grows up, and he moves away to college and his toys are destined for different places. There's a really horrifying scene where the toys are being played with by younger children. The difference in the animation, between this installment and the first two films, is just night and day. It's the first movie in this franchise where I didn't really think about the animation whatsoever. It's a good conclusion to this franchise, and I'm not sure why they made more films.",

Today I saw the third instalment to the masterpiece and I can honestly say that this is the best.

I went home walked into my room a realized that my Optimus Prime is not at the foot of my door, my Sylvester the Cat stuffed toy was not on my bed, and my McDonald's Sonic the Hedgehog toy was not on my shelf. My conner only housed my stack of video games. I asked myself why did my mother give away my toys without my permission? At THAT moment is when I thought about the last 30 minutes of Toy Story 3 I started to cry. This film was a carelessly thoughtful stoke of genius! It keeps both children and adults entertained. Lots of drama, lots suspense, and lots of toys! Disney and Pixar outdid themselves with this one. Toy Story was a smash hit when it first hit the screens. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, was not as good as its first installment but it was a film that almost never hit theaters so I'll give them the benefit of doubt. But Toy Story 3 set the bar ""to infinity and beyond!"" The VA cast was pheNOMenal. The visuals were stunning! The script was enjoyable! This movie reached all corners of film greatness (and its a kid's movie). I have no idea how Disney and Pixar knock out great movies like this (they make it look easy). I related to Andy in this film just as I did in Toy Story 3. The ending was so tough to watch without sniffling because if you watched Toy Story at around Andy's age during the time and you watch Toy Story 3 around Andy's age now (he was 17 and I am 22 and went through roughly the same hassle as he did when he was moving out for college), you would feel a wallop of emotion.

The first time i heard that they were making toy story 3 i got excited and worried at the same time, but when i heard all the good reviews and talk about it was my ambition to see it! it was just so.. well.. it couldn't have been better. a true masterpiece. and plus it was the third instalment which is quite tricky to make a good movie out of, even a sequel is hard, let alone a third. but thanks to toy story 3, i have faith in Pixar's future and cars 2! i was totally against the sequel at first but now i think it could be great! The 3d for toy story 3 was fine, nothing gimmicky or rubbish, although it didn't need it, it gave the movie more depth and emotion. The characters are all fun, even the new ones. This movie is entertaining for all ages. It ended the trilogy in the best possible way and if they were to make a 4th, that would be so stupid because it ended the series so perfectly! My overall rating is a 10/10. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys being happy.",

I just don't get it. (Especially with how amazing the first two T.S's were) This movie started off with the characters in trauma, and kept it that way all the way through, with each situation growing more and more sinister. This is supposed to be a kids' movie?? How is it appropriate to insinuate torture and prison in a kids' movie? Seems to me the writers ran out of ideas and rehashed almost the same plot (the toys need rescuing) from the previous movie, only this time involved more times riding in a garbage truck, involved a scary, crushing, fiery furnace, and and evil bear who in my opinion was a borderline racist casting (started off southern black-friendly and ended up sounding like a black thug)! and let's not forget to mention the disturbing and demented ""Big Baby"" dragging off beloved Mr. Potato Head to ""teach him a lesson"". I am almost laughing as i write seriously here about the torturing of Mr. Potato Head, but honestly, my boyfriend and i felt traumatized watching this movie. Kids may be immune, but we weren't! Laziness on the part of the writers, perhaps. Definitely -not- ""best picture"" material!! I honestly do not mean to offend people here, but what are you people thinking?? peace, S",

This is a trilogy that grew up with its viewers.

Let em get straight to the point: I thought that the movie was very well made, the animation, like all Pixar movies, was excellent, the story was excellent, and the humor was priceless. Many people expected too much out of this movie, but it was better than I myself expected. Well worth seeing, but be sure to know the first two well before seeing this one, because it won't mean as much if you don't.

The attic toys mistakenly wind up going to a local daycare. They are thrilled about the move, because they are under the impression that Andy doesn't want them because of the mistaken voyage.

They are constantly abused by the younger children and they are soon under the power of the great Lotso (voice of Ned Beatty and his right hand man Ken (voice of Michael Keaton), followed by the giant, freakish, lazy eyed, non speaking toddler.

656,20 June 2010,nikiburgoyne71,10, Capturing the hearts of young and old,"Toy Story is one of the best, if not the best children's/family movies of all time. The children are captivated with the most fascinating toys coming to life while the parents/adults feel like kids again. It brings back the memories of your childhood toys. Since then there was Toy Story 2 which brought all your favourites back to life once again and a few more. But I have to say Toy Story 3 was on a whole new level where those children who's seen the first movies are now grown too and the parent's feel that sense of your child growing up and moving on to life of their own. It was an extremely sentimental movie to me, but still managed to bring many laughs. I can honestly say that I loved this movie and the whole Toy Story trilogy. So, grab you children, teenagers too and don't forget your Kleenex as you watch the years enfold before your eyes. Great Job Disney Pixar. It will always hold a special place in my heart.",

I would go as far to say that it is better than 1&2. I thought that the story-line was very good and it was very cleverly made. It is amazing the difference in animation compared to the first two. My only complaint would be that they had left it too long, as 1&2 came out relatively close together and I have had to wait about 11 years for 3. Overall I would say that Toy Story 3 is a great family film and is definitely worth watching. I would rate it 8.5/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone.",

I LOVED Toy story 1 and 2, but this one didn't quite make the jump. The emotions got sorta cheesy and it would have ended way better if they were burned in the garbage place. Call me evil, but i don't actually wanna see them die. It would have just been a really good metaphor for departing from Andy. But then all the kids would have cried so obviously they couldn't do it.",
661,28 June 2010,carlosleonrendon,10, Pixar at their best!,"The minute I saw the trailer for Toy story 3 I was blown away and it brought back so many memories that the past year has been just waiting anxiously for it to come out. Then the movies came out on blu-ray, what better way to prepare for this amazing adventure that Pixar gave us. I have to say, when I saw Wall-E I was just surprised to see how they could get people of all ages to get so emotional with such unusual characters. That lovely robot that changed the fate of mankind and had us laughing for quite a while, to that 80 year old grumpy man. By the way, with Up, they made people fall in love with a character within 10 minutes. I think some people don't realize that for some movies, it takes the writers 2 hours to make people identify with the characters. Without doubt, The Pixar people know that when they are making a movie, they are making THE movie of the year. I grew up with Toy story, as many other reviewers here. I still laugh with the same movies and still get my heart a LITTLE broken every time I see that part in the first Toy Story with the song ""I Will Go Sailing No More"". The night I went to watch this movie I was with a few friends from the US (I'm from Mexico and we only get the dubbed version which is pretty awesome too, and I don't generally like dubbed movies). Their Spanish is not great so some parts were a little hard for them to understand. It was not necessary for them to get every single line, and I think it made them focus on the expressions of the toys, the music, the lighting and they too were crying as well as most people in the room, I can't wait for them to watch it in English and then watch it with a completely different perspective. Although it is a movie for kids, it is the darker of the three, the second time I saw it I was with a couple of little kids and they were really scared in some parts. Ever since Wall-E I came to realize how universal their movies are, so little dialogue, so many emotions. I guess this is probably not a great review of the movie, it is more like the experience you are probably gonna get. It's a movie in which you will laugh, cry, get scared, angry and who knows how many other things. So many life lessons that about friendship and love. I felt like I was 8 years old again, nothing mattered but the great stories I made up with all my toys, I didn't want to grow up (I still think some part of me didn't and that is why I enjoy this movies so much), but somehow, this movie showed a different side of the script and story that you don't get when you are a kid. **SPOILER for Finding Nemo** It was like that part in Finding Nemo when they are hanging to the whales tongue and Dory says: It's time to let go! Marlin: How do you know, how do you know something bad isn't gonna happen?! Dory: I don't! A kid would just probably get plain lines without special meaning. Just ask a parent if they got the same simple lines. Dreamworks' Shrek made the same thing with adult jokes. Don't get me wrong, Shrek is a great movie, I guess if I had to choose to watch a movie over and over again between these two... Toy story... always Toy Story",

Once again, Tom Hanks brilliantly brings Woody to life, with the same holding true to Tim Allen and all the other voices for the toys. ***SPOILER*** Now, when the Toys accept ""death"" and all hold hands going into the incinerator, this touches you in the heart. Then they are saved by ""the Claaawwww"" (As the green aliens call it). When I was watching a sold out showing of this movie, the entire crowd erupted in applause and laughter. Never, EVER in my movie watching experience have I seen a crowd SO into a movie that they applaud when a character is saved. This shows the Pixar Artistry at work. Even in the incredible UP, (2009) no one applauded for Carl when he saved Russel. Enough said, GO SEE IT NOW",

Everything Pixar has done is better than anything Dreamworks has done, and that includes Shrek, because Pixar movies have story, and heart, and a respect for the audience. All this said, I was afraid to see Toy Story 3, because it is a sequel to a sequel, something Hollywood has never done well. Take the Godfather saga—Godfathers 1 and 2 are the iconic American story; Godfather 3 is mess made long after the others and starring the director's daughter. Or take the blatant case of ""I have no ideas left, but can still make some money""—Back to the Future 3. Like Godfather 2, Back to the Future 2 worked hard to explain the cause and effect behind the original. In Back to the Future 3, they had Michael J. Fox for a couple extra months, so they put a cowboy hat on him and waited for the money to roll in. To their great credit, Pixar has created a Toy Story 3 that is true to the original, but that has its own story, one that expands on the earlier films with a new message of not living in the past. I knew Pixar had not failed when the opening scene—a spectacular action sequence reminiscent of Back to the Future 3—was quickly left behind and supplanted with a real human story.",

After leaving the theater, all doubts that I could ever have had about Pixar and their capability were gone. Pixar, once again, had demonstrated their ability to overcome expectations. Toy Story 3 was one of the best sad comedies that I have ever seen. I love how mostly everyone can relate to it. At some point of everyone's lives, one has to move on and leave behind the toys that he/she really cared about. I can relate to the character Andy because I, also, had to put toys away before leaving for college. It is a love/hate relationship because you know that you need to move on, but at the same time the thought of leaving them behind can scare anyone.",

Toy Story 3 maintains the excellent visual effects and Pixar's animation is excellent as always. But the story writers fell asleep at the pen and pad this time around. The battle of good and evil, the friends and foes was perhaps a little too intricate for the intended viewing audience. Children. Disturbingly enough for adults you were taken on this emotional roller coaster of loss, anxiety, fear, deceit, and just about everything else. How the writers bring this coaster to its finish was even more poor. This really wasn't the movie that I think many children would have learned anything from, let alone enjoyed. -Ravi Shanghavi, Ottawa",

Of course I don't remember seeing it then but my father told me he took me to see it. Now the third movie is out and the character Andy is supposed to be seventeen, which is what age I am now. It makes me feel as if I grew up with him. At the end of the movie when Andy is giving up Woody, Buzz and the gang it resembles how I feel as well. It seems very hard for him to give his childhood up, just as it is for me. Both of us nearing eighteen and having to give up, or at least, put our childhood behind us. I'm sad that the trilogy is over, but if they made another I fear it would totally ruin everything. I didn't expect the movie to be as good as it was and I definitely didn't see it as a cartoon.

Toy Story 3 continues the franchise's tradition of telling stories that tap into the sense of wonder and imagination in adults and children alike. Like all of Pixar's movies, the characters, comedy, and storytelling brim with more ingenuity, wit, and heart than nearly anything else on the market. They don't just make great children's films or great family films, they make great films, period. Like last year's Up, Toy Story 3 explores poignant themes of aging and mortality while wowing audiences with thrilling adventure and humor that puts competitors to shame. It is as charming as the first two films, with the advantage of ten years' advancement in computer animation and a screenplay that is truly touching. Highly recommended for the whole family (except the youngest of children; our heroes are put in grave peril, which may frighten or disturb them).",
