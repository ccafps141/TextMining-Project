0,29 December 2004,FilmFlaneur,10, One of the greatest wars films ever made,"One of the greatest of all war films, Klimov's stunning work stands amongst such works in which the horror and sorrow of conflict are made fresh over again for the viewer, left to stumble numb from the cinema thereafter. Produced for the 40th anniversary of Russia's triumph over the German invaders in WW2, based upon a novella by a writer who was a teenage partisan during the war, the propagandist use to which it was later put - when the GDR was still in the Eastern Bloc, citizens were forced to watch this to warn them of another rise of fascism - does not impair its effect today at all. It echoes intensity found in another masterpiece by the director. Klimov's shorter Larissa (1980) is a remorseful elegy to his late wife. Poetic and very personal, its sense of shock anticipates the heightened anguish that ultimately reverberates through Come And See. Through his images, the director stares uncomprehendingly at a world where lives are removed cruelly and without reason, if on this occasion not just one, but thousands.",/
1,3 May 2007,Asa_Nisi_Masa2,10, Masterpiece alert!,"Even before the final credits rolled, I strongly suspected this movie would end up on my Top 20; in fact, perhaps even my Top 10. A teenage boy, his hearing impaired from having just been at the site of a bombing, and a young woman clutching at him, the two of them stumbling and sludging through a slimy, smelly bog. A stork in the woods as it rains. A cluster of dolls piled up on the floor with flies buzzing all over the room. You don't need vast, elaborately choreographed battle scenes to bring home the message of the senselessness and pain of war. Reading viewers' comments on the movie, it seems that most found the second half  which admittedly contained some of the most powerful massacre scenes ever filmed  as the most ""satisfying"". A few other viewers seem to imply the movie doesn't really get going until the second half. For me, it was the first half that got under my skin the most, for its cinematic originality, poetry and symbolic power. War is experienced by civilians as well as by soldiers: this may seem like an obvious statement, but it's only after watching Come and See that you realise how few war movies are truly about the suffering of the ordinary man and woman, defenseless child and frail senior citizen. Also, never before had I seen the plight of raped women in war so powerfully conveyed, and all this without the movie ever being voyeuristic or graphic. In cinema, rape is often portrayed as something that looks like rough sex. It isn't always quite clear why women get so upset over it. In Come and See, rape is shown as nothing but pure, unadulterated, hate-fuelled violence with only a superficial, external resemblance to sex. Unlike other raped women on film, you cannot imagine those in Come and See ever healing from their scars. ",r
2,6 July 2006,HumanoidOfFlesh,10, Jaw-droppingly powerful and truly disturbing Russian war drama.,"""Come and See"" has to be one of the most powerful war movies ever made.It left me emotionally drained.The film tells the story of 12-year-old Florya(Alexi Kravchenko),whose desire is to join his countrymen in the battle against the fascists.His enthusiasm is written all over his face:in the opening scenes,which show Florya's recruitment by partisan soldiers,he wears the blissed-out smile of a hopeful child.After a bombardment,which leaves him temporarily deaf,he is left behind and stumbles across Glasha(Olga Mironova),who has also been abandoned.Together they return to his village, the atrocities witnessed there anticipating horrors to come.""Come and See"" is a deeply unsettling film.It's hallucinatory,hellish,traumatizing and uncompromising.There's an aura of profound sadness here,as Florya ages dramatically over the course of the story's events.The film's most disturbing sequence revolves around the raising of one village and the slaughter of most of its inhabitants.The acting is excellent,the cinematography is stunning and the use of Mozart on the soundtrack is particularly effective.10 out of 10.A must-see!",e
3,26 April 2021,clanciai,10, Overwhelming masterpiece of a child's awakening to the realities of war,"This is one of the most realistic war films ever made, and it's the more realistic for being shown and exposed from the point of view of a child, which enhances the impact and makes the realism with its constantly increasing chain reaction of shocks, more and more growing to unbearable self-tormenting horrors and abhorrence, the more almost unendurable, but you have to stay on and see it all thorugh to the end. It is to be noted, that he never uses his rifle until in the very end, and the only target of his ultimate fire is some images. But that final outburst opens the finale of the greatest sequence of the film.",v
4,7 January 2017,lee_eisenberg,10, horrors of war in 1940s Belarus,"Elem Klimov's final film is a devastating look at the horrors of war through the eyes of a teenage boy who joins the partisans in Belarus (then the Byelorussian SSR or White Russian SSR). Much like Mike Nichols's ""Catch-22"" and Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Idi i smotri"" (""Come and See"" in English) makes you feel as if the war is hitting you directly. And this movie leaves little to the imagination in showing the Nazis' brutality. Probably the most famous scene is when the Nazis burn down a house. There's music playing the entire time to ensure that the noise doesn't stop. You have rarely seen something as intense as this on screen.",i
5,5 January 2000,bnm81510,9, Apocalypse Then,"In all fairness, this Belorussian-made World War II picture detailing Nazi atrocities, holds a special distinction in world cinema: it is by far the most brutal and emotionally draining of all - in fact, a viewer whose senses have not been properly trained would most likely find it unwatchable. Those brave souls willing to be put through an ordeal of almost 2 1/2 hours will find themselves deeply immersed in an absolutely horrifying experience that will not easily subside whether they want it to or not.",e
6,12 May 2006,paulmartin177,10," I saw a film today , oh boy...","I have a bad habit of reading too many reviews and comments about a film before I've seen it, mainly to get an idea about whether it's going to be worth a couple of hours of my time watching it. As a result, I am often slightly disappointed with much of what I see, as all the hype that I've read about a film kind of blows my expectations out of all proportion. I had a feeling this would be the case with Elem Klimov's 'Come and See', a film I'd read a lot about, particularly here on the IMDb. (Imagine my ""excitement"" when, having tried to see the film for nearly a year, I discovered it was to be released on DVD a week or two ago from today!) Well, I finally watched the film yesterday and... well, nothing could have prepared me for the sheer intensity and unflinching visceral horror of the atrocities that 'Come and See' invites us to... come and see. (Has anyone commented before on what a clever title that actually is...?) This is one of those films, like, say, 'Requiem For A Dream' or 'The Magdalene Sisters' (both of which, though great films, are simply not in the same league as Klimov's film), that one does not (obviously) so much enjoy as submit oneself to. By the end of such films we are left numbed and shell-shocked, wondering what we are supposed to do with the intense emotions that have been evoked within us. Yes, I felt like the ground had been pulled from beneath me; yes, what I saw in that film made my blood boil, my head hurt and my heart pound; and, yes, it showed me things I'd seen before but to a degree of intensity and detail that I had not experienced before. The point though, I guess, is that the role of cinema (and art in general) is not to offer answers or tell us what to think but to simply show us particular events and characters and allow us to come to our own decisions about what those things 'mean'. I'm rambling now, but I'll simply end by saying that 'Come and See' is, with its outstanding technical and artistic credentials aside, a film whose very title alone demands that it be seen. It is the work of a visionary, a cry of despair from the depths of hell, and an important reminder of humanity's capacity for inhumanity Go and see...",w

10,28 January 2010,Theo Robertson,9, Once Seen Never Ever Forgotten,"Elem Klimov's COME AND SEE is a film best remembered for one scene and it'd probably be wrong to say it should be remembered for more that since THAT scene is one of the most disturbing and harrowing ever committed to celluloid . It also means the rest of the movie struggles hard to make up for it even though it tries . In many ways it's a throwback to the Soviet Home Front type of war movie mixed with Tarkovsky . Nature in all its imagery features prominently throughout the film . Forests are beautiful , green and silent on the surface but feature filthy , stinking swamps where a human can drown in . Man is also a hostage to the elements where rain soaks the skin and causes a human being to shiver .

13,29 January 2006,planktonrules,8, exceptionally gritty and realistic,"This film was no fun to watch, nor should it have been considering it is about the Nazi atrocities in Belarus during WWII--as seen through the eyes of a young recruit for the partisans. This young boy appears to be about 12 or maybe 13, though through the course of the film, he ages what appears to be many years, though the action that occurs seemed to take place over just a few days. The movie was a solid recreation of the horrors and is good because it makes the faces and lives affected by this sick war so very real. Because of its content, it is not a film for children, though it probably is okay for teens provided you discuss the movie with them afterwards. No serious complaints about the movie at all, though it would have been nice if the German planes they used in the film weren't the same FW-189 reconnaissance aircraft over and over again--but this is the most minor of complaints--it was a great picture overall.",6

15,22 March 2008,vlad_reven,10, a brief comment on some comments,"What most of the foreign viewers perhaps don't understand is that the factual side of the movie has always been a common knowledge among millions of Russians especially those of older generations. People like me, who were born 10-15 years after the war ended, knew it all along first hand from the stories told by parents and grandparents actually living through those times and events. My own mother at the age of seven was thrown by German soldiers into a barn that got lit, her front teeth were knocked out by the butt of a German soldier's rifle and she, along with tenth of other village kids, was saved by my grand-mother and other villagers only because some partisans had chosen to attack and deliberate the village that day. What most of Western viewers find horrifying, shocking and disturbing is nothing but the truth being accurately depicted by some later movie makers. This movie is pretty much like a documentary that could actually be shot with the help of some sort of a ""time machine"" in case there was one in 1985 when the movie got filmed.",6
16,20 November 2017,classicsoncall,10," ""You didn't know it would turn out like this, did you?""","It's probably a good thing that we have movies like this that show the brutality and evil of war, but I don't know if the mass of humanity ever learns from them. In recent days I've watched this movie and ""The Battle of Algiers"", and if you look at present day headlines and follow news of terrorism around the world, one must concede that the aggressive use of force is a distinct part of Man's nature. This is a viscerally disturbing film to watch, with scene after scene of intense brutality that would render a normal person who experienced it dysfunctional and mentally unhinged from reality.",8

18,25 June 2001,LSigno,10," Death, destruction and despair","There's not much one can say about this movie, besides ""Be warned, it's going to hurt you - a lot"". The story is simple: Byelorussia in 1943 and it's Hell on the Earth. The Nazis are fighting a no-quarter-given-or-asked war against huge Soviet partisan units, and the population is caught in between (historically the German security forces destroyed hundred of Byelorussian villages murdering most of the population in the effort to ""clear"" the rear of Third Panzer Army). Those who haven't been deported or killed by the Nazis are trying to join the partisans. One of them is Florya, a young boy - and in his quest to ""join the fight"" he get much more he had bargained for. It's a movie about an apocalyptic world (the title is taken from the Book of Revelation, a most of the movie looks like it has been filmed on another planet), but unfortunately it was all-real. The emotional centre of the movie is a lengthy sequence involving the destruction of a village, with all the sickening (but not exploitative) details shown with cold determination. There's no catharsis (this is not Schindler's List!), no hope, no redemption - even the eventual revenge against the village's destroyers become just a sad and murderous business. ""Come And See"" is a difficult, violent and surprisingly poetic movie, compared to which even classics like ""Saving Private Ryan"" (Spielberg payed a homage to this movie on SPR's beginning) or ""The Thin Red Line"" seems just artificial. This is the real thing!",?
19,8 March 2023,Andrew426,9, A surreal and effective nightmare of an anti-war film,"Trust the Russians to make one of the most miserable films ever made! I was told horror stories about Come and See - how it was one of the most harrowing and brutal films ever, how it superseded most horror films, and how it left its actors in a state of trauma after filming.

20,16 July 2006,EVOL666,9, One Of THE Most Powerful Films I've Ever Seen...,"First off - I will readily admit my ""ignorance"" to the actual historical facts of the state-of-affairs in Europe and Russia during the time-frame in which COME AND SEE is set. I do know ""some"" of what was going on during WWII (as I'm not a completely illiterate moron...) but I won't even begin to try to come off as erudite as some reviewers who obviously know FAR more about world-history than I do. Instead - I will approach this review strictly from the viewpoint of a film-fan. That said - COME AND SEE is definitely one of the most harrowing films that I've ever come across. Being mainly an ""underground"" horror fan - I've made it my life's work to seek out the most sickening, disturbing, twisted, nihilistic films that could possibly be laid to film - and honestly - the few films that have actually ""touched a nerve"" with me, typically are not by definition ""horror"" films at all - but then again - if these types of films can't be considered in the realm of ""horror"" - then what truly can???

25,31 July 2021,briancham1994,10, Absolutely horrifying,"I haven't been this affected by a film since Schindler's List. It displays the pure brutality of war in a naturalistic, lingering way that does not allow the viewer to ever take a break. The imagery and cinematography are evocative and disturbing. The main character shows us what war is like through the eyes of a child, and the horrific expression at the end matches how haunted the audience feels as well. This film is incredibly depressing with no hope or redemption at all. The sense of realism is terrifying, and all the better for it.",t

27,5 February 2020,gbill-74877,9, Masterpiece,"There's a moment in 'Come and See' when director Elem Klimov directly references Tarkovsky's classic 'Ivan's Childhood' - it's when the boy peers down into a well and sees his reflection in the water - and there are probably all sorts of other parallels as well, such as that beautiful scene when he's in the forest shaking the tall trees with the girl to make the water splash down. It really made me want to see the films back to back and compare them in their imagery, camera technique, and what they tell us about the Russian experience during the war. This film is certainly darker (much darker, my god), and a part of me thinks that Klimov was building on the great Tarkovsky's work and saying that this was Ivan's real childhood, a nightmare of apocalyptic proportions.",u

29,31 January 2019,searchanddestroy-1,10," Absolutely terrific, outstanding.","I comment this awesome war movie, the best ever made - which all the other comments have already described far better than I will do - because I just watched another Russian war movie directed by the wife of the director of this one, Larisa Sheptiko made herself another masterpiece: THE ASCENT for which Elem Klimov - her husband - gives here a sort of tribute to. Very similar topic if you watch closely. They are not just propaganda war films, as were so many USSR features describing the horrors of the Russian front. COME AND SEE and THE ASCENT just told the real truth about the atrocities that the Nazis commited. Because I consider that showing the regular German and Russian armies fighting against each other on the front doesn't require to point out who are the good and who are the evil guys. That's my own opinion. How could we here showing the Russian partisans as the bad and the Einsatzgruppen the good ones?",v

31,9 February 2011,gutierrez_garrett_an,10," Absolutely haunting, possibly traumatizing","If any movie can induce PTSD or reduce one's expected lifespan simply by viewing it, this is that film. I am not usually in favor of restricting movie viewership, but this is one film that I cannot rightfully recommend to any person under the age of 18. If I had watched this film when I was 12, I would have either created some sort of psychological barrier and have been unable to fully comprehend the events taking place, or I would have been emotionally damaged for life. Possibly both. After viewing ""Come and See"", I am a changed man. Though it contains no graphic sex, outright gore, or extensive vulgarity, ""Come and See"" is so powerful it's haunted me long after it ended. I've seen many horror movies (and even more war movies throughout my life, but no film I've ever seen even holds a candle to ""Come and See"" in terms of psychological trauma. I've heard stories about the horrors of the holocaust and of WWII, my grandfather was even in a concentration camp in Poland during the war- at the tender age of 14, about the same age as the main character in the film. I've read ""Night"" by Elie Wiesel, and I have seen ""Schindler's List,"" and though I felt great sorrow for the pain of those who lived through such terrible ordeals, at the end of the day all of the stories I'd heard resonated with me as just that; stories (very real stories, but stories nonetheless). This was not the case with ""Come and See."" Klimov's brilliant directing style is somehow capable of pulling you in and making you feel absolutely helpless against the surrounding evils. Not just sorrow and remorse for the characters, but complete empathy for their pain in a way that is indescribable. ""Schindler's List"" might be hard to get through at times, but you still remain fully cognizant of the screen separating you from the death and suffering you see. ""Come and See"" destroys that protective mechanism. As an audience member, you have no feelings of ""seeing"" the film through a lens, but you ""experience"" it like you might experience the effects of a hallucinogenic substance that latches onto your brain and changes the very chemicals that determine the way you view the world- in a way I would imagine that is similar to an LSD trip gone horribly wrong. I now have even greater compassion for my grandfather's ordeals, and cannot imagine what I would have done were I in the same position as he. The film raises serious questions about whether or not it is truly ""better"" to survive a massacre than die in it. Even if you walk out of this film, it's too late. Closing your eyes, covering your ears; all attempts at ignorance are pointless -because ""Come and See"" goes past your vision and hearing- it penetrates your very consciousness. If you've seen enough to want to turn off the film, it's already too late and you've already felt the film's power. By the end of it, there is no way you'll ever look at war the same way again, and you'll likely remember this film and its lessons for years to come. Every single person considering joining the military, and every single person capable of voting should watch this film, because I guarantee it will cause you to deeply reconsider the choices that could easily send thousands of men into similar situations you see unfolding in ""Come and See."" Though I am always in favor of watching all great movies at least twice, and though ""Come and See"" is nothing less than great (if not spectacular), it is one film I dread watching a second time. Be sure to have a pack of cigarettes, black coffee, and/or a stiff drink ready in hand before viewing this film.",

35,30 October 2020,Horst_In_Translation,8," Very touching anti-war movie, deservingly high rating here on imdb","""Idi i smotri"" or ""Come and See"" is a Soviet movie from 1985 (looks newer), so this one came out when I was not even a year old. It is mostly in the Russian language, but as it is set in Belarus and elaborates crucially on the country''s history during World War II, there are also parts in Belarussian and German of course and not just one or two sentences, which caught my attention especially because I am from Germany. Now as for this film, there are apparently two different versions in existence: first the standard version that runs for over 2 hours and 20 minutes and then there is a strongly cut version that runs for 1 hour and 45 minutes, so over 35 minutes shorter, but even if this film includes moments of utter violence, they must have cut out considerably more if they are taking away over half an hour. I have seen the long version today at a movie theater, so I cannot say what is missing in the shorter version. So you see this film is still somewhat known (and rightfully so) if it is shown in German movie theaters and not just once or twice, but for several weeks apparently, which may have to do with the 35th anniversary for this one. The director is Elem Klimov and he is also one of the two writers. He was around the age of 50 when he made this movie, so not too old and yet this was his final career effort. He lived on for almost 20 years, but never directed another movie. Many film directors peak early, sometimes never reach the level of their breakthrough film again, but Klimov is the exact opposite. This final career effort we have here is still his most known work apparently. Now I do not want to talk about the cast in detail really because I am not an expert on Soviet films or actors, but the incredibly strong child actor Aleksey Kravchenko, who you can see on the photo, is still active in movies today, still acts, and he turned 50 last year. It seems that this film we have here is also still his most known work as of now and will most likely stay the film that people will always remember him for.",

42,2 July 2015,Quinoa1984,9, Horror by Stedicam in this near-masterpiece,"Come and See comes off almost like a post-apocalyptic film, far more than what you typically may associate with a world war two spectacle. Of course director Francois Truffaut once said that you can't make a war film as 'anti'-war because of the excitement of the violence. Aside from many other examples refuting this, Come and See isn't simply anti-war, that would be too easy. Director Elem Klimov (in what turned out to be his final film) lays on the brutality and the barbarism so thick and with such force and magnified wrath that you'll never want to watch another war film as long as you live - and really, how can you go back to watching a regular ol' shoot-em-up-let's-kill-bad-guys war flick after this? You're basically put in the position as the audience member of the main character, the boy Florya (Kravchenko), and you are witness to see ALL of the devastation that the Nazis levy on the Belarussians.

52,11 December 2005,myboigie,10, The Most Honest War Film,"Forget ""Saving Private Ryan"", this is the real-story of who fought and suffered the most during-WWII: ethnic-Slavs within the Soviet Union. Most Westerners have little-or-no idea about what the Russian-front was and what it means in the scope of human-history. Centered mostly around the experiences of a young Byelorussian-peasant, this is what war is. Klimov stated in interviews before his passing that a number of elements came from his own experiences, and that he left-out many horrors that were even-worse. Like Iraq, the invasion of the Soviet Union was passed-off as a ""preemptive"" strike to stop ""Bolshevik-terrorists"", when it was really about creating a German settler-state that had been wiped-clean of Slavs by the Einsatzgruppe. SS units often razed entire villages, leaving nobody alive. We see a bit of this early-on in the film when the young-Byelorussian returns to his village--to the sound of buzzing-flies. All of this was necessary to the National Socialist-hierarchy to pay-off reckless loans that were the backbone of the Nazi ""economic-miracle"". Taking territory, and exploiting it was the only way Hitler and the Nazis had to do this. There is a similar-dynamic to American-involvement in Iraq, right-now. Proportionally, we are doing the same-thing, for the same-reasons. Not all films are for entertainment, and Klimov wanted us to remember so there wouldn't be another ""Operation Barbarossa"".",

59,21 June 2020,lyubitelfilmov,9, To shiver or The most cruel film about the Great Patriotic War,"Historical drama. The Khatyn Story by the famous Soviet writer Ales Adamovich, who was the author of the script, along with director Elem Klimov, formed the basis of the script. I want to write right away that the review will be very serious, it will not contain irony, jokes and a favorable mood, as I usually do. If you decide to read the review with humor, self-irony of the author - then read my other reviews. Such seriousness is due to the picture itself. So, I have long heard about this film, which influenced the director so much that after it he could no longer make a movie. Everything was delayed by the viewing, but finally decided today, on the eve of the eightieth anniversary of the German attack on the Soviet Union. And here is my brief opinion - I thought it would be tougher. Partly, the picture disappointed me, for which I will explain below. Despite the obvious pluses, I also found cons in the picture that were associated with my personal expectations, so you can consider them nit-picking. With the introduction, you can finish, and you can begin to analyze the true masterpiece of the beginning of Perestroika.
So, the obvious pluses:
1. The story of the protagonist - the picture tells the story of Flera, a sixteen-year-old teenager who in a few days goes from a cheerful and a little silly kid to an old man with gray hair, having gone through the horror of the punitive action of the Nazis. For more than two hours, we have been closely watching this incredible transformation that Fleur is going through. At first he smiles, tries to live, but in the end he is a silent old man who saw the horror of the bloody war that will remain with him until the very last minute of his life, and if he survives this massacre, then its echo will haunt him, slowly reduce it to of the mind. Young Alexei Kravchenko, for whom this picture was a debut in a big movie, gave all the best. You believe his hero, you empathize, sometimes you don't understand, yes, it was like that. But many children of the war went a similar way, someone was lucky, someone was not, but the image of Flera was taken from life, well, maybe a little embellished for more drama. Clingingly realistic, truthful and cruel!
2. The horrors of war - this picture can be called in its full program the most cruel not only about the Great Patriotic War, but also about the Second World War as a whole, because they did not remove anything like this before or after. Attempts were, for example, ""Schindler's List"" (which I watched and consider the best American picture about World War II), and although I respect Spielberg for his work, but after seeing ""Go and See"", I realized that old Stephen will only be on this list second place. Yes, even ""Saving Private Ryan"" against the backdrop of ""Go and See"" looks like a miserable parody of the war. I'll say that Elem Klimov did not dare to show all those atrocities that the Nazis did, along with the policemen in the occupied territory, otherwise the picture would not be released at all. But even that which was removed is more than enough to know the difference between man and beast, between communist and fascist. The burning of the village was inspired precisely by the Belarusian Khatyn, whose name became a household word, but such ""Khatyn"" in only one Belarus punishers burned about six hundred, and how many were there throughout the occupied territory of the Soviet Union? Many, and more than half, could not be restored, because the inhabitants were worn out. The picture reflects the essence of fascism - the most cruel ideology that a sophisticated human brain could come up with. I recommend keeping Corvalol or ammonia particularly viewing when viewing, since the sight is not for the faint of heart. Bullying by punitive civilians, executions, burning, killing children, rape, fanaticalism of some brainwashed performers. It's hard, it's cruel, but you have to watch it so that it never happens again!
So cons:
1. A tedious first half - I thought that the picture would immediately begin to show tin, but no, about half the time you will have to wait for it, but not everyone can. I am just a patient person, for which I was rewarded with the entire second half of the picture.
2. Arthouse - this can be safely written into the genre, since all the signs on the face - there is almost no music, the hero almost does not speak, and you always ask questions like ""What's going on?"" and ""What the hell is this?"" I was not ready for this. I will tell you frankly. Thank you for delivering classical music.
3. I expected more - I was getting ready to see real tin without embellishment and censorship so that a tub of cold water would be poured on me - and in the end I saw predictable things that I saw earlier in the documentaries about the war. No, the horror scenes of the war definitely happened, it's only a pity that the most cruel Klimov was not allowed to be inserted in the final part, which is full of allusions and metaphors. This is pure nitpicking, because I was brought up by the good Soviet cartoons and bloody Hollywood fighters, so I was not particularly impressed. But I can imagine what was happening in movie theaters around the world then - it was a real shock and awe.
A little about the main characters:
1. Fleur performed by Alexei Kravchenko - a cheerful teenager who went through the horrors of the Nazi punitive operation in a few days, turning him into a gray-haired old man. I won't paint the hero's path for a long time - you'd better see for yourself, but again I'll praise young Alexei Kravchenko, who has so convincingly gotten into the role that this look, detached and devastated, will haunt me for a long time. Bravo Alexey!
2. Glasha performed by Olga Mironova is a girl whom Fleur meets in a partisan detachment with which he has to spend a certain time, let's say so. Glasha doesn't remember anything special, it's more like an image of an innocent girl whom the war will not spare. Olga coped very well with the role.
This picture is cruel, but it is possible, there is NO NEED to see everyone, not only the inhabitants of the former Soviet Union, but every inhabitant of the planet Earth, so that this horror never happens again. Stop fighting! Stop hating each other! If you do not stop the hatred, then we will all turn into beasts.
Elem Klimov removed a masterpiece that should remind us of our recent past and what our grandparents, great-grandmothers and great-grandfathers went through when they installed the Victory Banner in Berlin - the den of those animals who wanted to destroy us!
See the picture for everyone!",

67,20 December 2011,david-byrne,10, A truly outstanding film,"Rarely does a film like this come along. In fact, it puts a whole new dimension in film making. Although the film starts out somewhat slow, the viewer is immersed into the realism of rural life and partisans in Belorussia during WW2. As the film evolves, the viewer experiences to some extent the bleakness created by the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The bleakness suddenly turns to chaos and then a level of brutality only a Hun could be proud of, where all senses of morality and decency are absent. The acting in superb, even down to the facial expressions of the partisans. Rarely do you find such fine acting, even in the West. But of course one must consider most of actors would be well educated in the Nazi occupation of Belorussia and the evil unleashed from the monsters who killed off a third of the population of Belorussia. A sense of anger and even hopelessness is felt watching this intense war film. The film exposes in a very bad light another chapter of German crimes against humanity few in the West have learned of, crimes for which Germany can never repay now or in the future. The camera work is brilliant in the film, where the bleakness is highlighted in dull tones throughout. I would strongly advise children do not watch this film - it is simply too disturbing, to the extent it makes Saving Private Ryan look like a G-rated cartoon show. Even adults with a conscience would have difficulty coming to terms with the brutality of war as shown in this film. I suggest too the viewer researches further the German atrocities in Russia in World War 2.",

72,12 March 2019,robertemerald,10, Perfect war horror,"The Director here is a champion of what I call the camera sweep. At times the camera travels as if bound to a drone flying long and slow over rural Russia taking in the landscape and the effects of war. It's such a mesmerising tactic, making the viewer an eyewitness. The other technique used is the framing of the shots and the concentration on faces, in particular the boy whose life during the war we follow intimately. There are other techniques, such as the use of animals to show suffering and shock, brilliantly effective and very moving. The use of mists was terrifically atmospheric, and contained an impression of being on the edge of danger, which, of course, it was. There is still more genius though, as some sequences are shown just beyond forest lines, creating a sort of outrage, as well as a true sense of partisan warfare. As well as this, one comes to realise a really true picture of the Russian farming life, poor yet happy, cruelly upset in gradually increasing violence, and thus more outrage for the viewer. I don't know if this movie was intended as a tragedy involving a boy or a broader indictment of war and its ravages, but both have been indelibly achieved. It's true at times there is a certain weirdness to behaviours, and certainly some licence was taken, but again the Director has purpose. I can't go into specifics without using spoilers, but the initial return to home was one case in point. Again I consider this technique genius. The closing sequence is also a stroke of genius. I consider this movie to be seminal, along with The Grey Zone, Schindler's List and The City of Life and Death. Easily one of the most authentic and heart-breaking war movies I have ever seen.",

After finding an old rifle, a young boy joins the Soviet Army and experience the horrors of World War II. There's a popular story that's told regarding this film. It goes as follows: at a premier, there was an elderly German woman seated near the back of the audience who, half way through the screening, stood up and boldly declared: ""I was a Wehrmacht officer during the invasion of the Soviet Union, and I can declare that everything you see in this film is completely true!"". In studying war films, realism is a factor that features heavily in dictating the acclaim a film is given, and to what extent it can be a true success of the genre. Idi I Smorti's raw, sombre, horrifying, damaging and empirically sound content elevate it to divine upper reaches amidst the 'war film' niche to any historian or intellectual immediately. About a third of the way through the film Klimov, a Stanlingrad survivor, juxtaposes the historical face of dismay that the newly deafened young protagonist conjures, something that could speak louder than the script of any American take at the unparalleled devastation war brings, with a solemn, indifferent and colourful stalk (crane-like bird) that followers him through the deadpan lowland setting. It's a piece of camera work that brought me trauma and introspection. Stylistically, Idi I Smorti is superior to its western peers of the era, even though it is shot in a grainy aspect ratio, this only intensifies what Klimov is trying to accomplish with his work. In terms of substance, the way Klimov uses two strangers: a teenage boy and a teenage girl, their families ravaged and piled naked behind their home, cling together under mosses and ferns in a marshland forest, whilst the thick drones of German aircraft fly noir overhead, is something that hits especially hard to all that witness it. Following the boy's journey, through constant loss, fugue, blood, wrath and decadence is perfectly formed and perfectly balanced, all the way up to the final scene, where he shoots a series of portraits of Hitler as a series of montages display a rewind in his advance, starting with the burning villages of the boy's homeland and distancing further and further from such local horrors. But after what he occur has seen across rural Belarus, he cannot bring himself to shoot the portrait of the infant Hitler on his mother's lap. We feel at one with the character at this moment and his experiences of war are hammered home harder than any moment in any film that has ever produced. Idi I Smorti is real, undisturbed, pure film making that the likes of 'The Godfather' and 'Citizen Kane' can't match.",

The story follows a young Russian boy separated from his partisan brigade, and tracks his slow descent into insanity as he witnesses one atrocity after another, until Nazi soldiers finally herd him (and, by extension, us) into a crowded peasant church and set it ablaze with flamethrowers. After several long, ominous establishing scenes the pace builds with feverish intensity to the climactic moments of annihilation, a tour de force of camera-work and editing apt to leave a permanent scar on the viewer's nerves.

Although it's a harrowing film to sit through, it remains such a worthy and deserved experience (nonetheless). The story documents just one village in Belarus (circa 1942), out of over 600 that were cruelly burnt by SS regiments, on the march east. All of the inhabitants, men, women and children were locked inside wooden structures (commonly this would be the local church) and torched. These atrocities committed by the 'Barn Burners' Leibstandarte, are well documented and with just a single Soviet film, shifted the whole focus of attention, firmly out of Hollywood and horrifically into the heart of the Eastern Front; where the Russians eventually destroyed 85% of the 'Nazi War Machine'. 'Come and See' is not only an invitation to witness the truth but also to view a true masterclass of movie making. A must, not only for film students but for budding historians to. The 'War is Hell' theme has never been more clearly evident and even the ammunition fired was genuine for the sake of the mud, rags and tatters of hyper realism.",

With just how haunting and harrowing it is, and how strong the imagery is. It's a movie that just doesn't pull any punches. Even through the perspective of the main character, the kid, just seeing an innocent little child have all of his joy just sucked away from him and being forced to witness the most extreme, it's really effective and gut wrenching. I want to go on for hours about how great this movie is, but I'll leave it for now, till I watch the movie again.

The film depicts many of Nazi Germany's horrific war crimes in the region including setting people on fire with gasoline and rounding up entire villages to be shot or burned. While the vast scale of Nazi Germany's atrocities are widely understood today, it is still deeply haunting to witness these atrocities on film. By the end of the film, the viewer will feel as they have aged considerably after witnessing such horrific deeds. Even the young boy ages on-screen. By the climax of the film, the young boy who was so hopeful and energetic at the beginning of the film is nearly unrecognizable and the viewers are left with a grim reminder of what happened when German soldiers invaded the Soviet Union during World War II.",

This movie is psychologically mind-blowing, shocking, disturbing, disgusting, and it will make you cringe as you're sitting on the edge of your seat. It is one thing to know the facts about history, but it is an entirely different thing to see it, as realistically as you can in the form of a film or as realistically as you can without actually experiencing it - though after watching this film, it is debatable as to whether or not I was actually there experiencing the same trauma. After watching this film, I felt an overwhelming crush of defeat, as if all the problems of a world at peace were absolutely trivial in comparison to the horrid experiences these people had undergone. I found myself engulfed in the story, to the point that it no longer seemed to be a story, but my own reality. My own tension and sorrow began building up so quickly throughout the movie that once I saw the girl with the whistle walk out, raped and scarred for life, I snapped - I just lost it. One of the ideas flowing through my head was: ""If this is the world that MEN have created, then I no longer want to live in a world of men."" I would be lost in a suspension of disbelief for the next day and a half, hardly talking to anyone, staring at my food, with an absolute loss for words or even a peaceful thought.

This movie is far from being a masterpiece, or even a great movie. Klimov uses exaggerated allegories and metaphors that disarrange the dialogues and images. There are many scenes like that and they are clearly noticeable in the first segment of the movie, it seems the director introduced some of these scenes just to increase the length of the movie. Then Klimov shifts gears and presents us with the realism of the shock by showing us the atrocities of the Second World war. In this ""mixed salad"", what is left is little of art and more of the repulsive, sickening gut feeling to the rawness of the images of war.",
127,1 May 2020,krational66,8, The division of the war collective,"I was afraid to watch Russian or Soviet literature and art, and afraid to watch war movies, ""see it yourself"" is both, but under the influence of ni ke can not hold back to see it. Still saw, from yesterday afternoon to the evening, the film also more than two hours of length, but felt under too much pressure, in the interval for several hours to continue to see the end.
It's a film I hope humans won't be able to make (because there's no reference), although it's undeniably a stunning masterpiece.
The film is set in white Russia in 1943, two years after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet union, during which it is self-evident that many brutal battles took place, but the camera avoids the battlefield where the two sides are directly depicted, and follows closely a boy who joins the army.
Young floriola with partners in the ruins of the war in the gun, with a gun, he can join the guerrillas. He got his wish, bid farewell to his mother and a pair of naive and lovely twin sisters, was disguised as the German guerrillas away.
In the froyola home, the mother received the two soldiers who had come to take her son with a mixture of fear, anxiety, and a vague hatred. When one of them, a large, jargon-prone, stiff-faced soldier, tried to amuse his two younger sisters, the children were terrified and on the verge of tears. This is in stark contrast to the scene when the mother angrily thrust the axe into her brother's hand, threatening to have him chop them to death before leaving the house. Despite attempts to be kind and reassuring, even the casual children felt strange and nervous in the two adults who had gone to war, an aura that was hard to blend with their daily lives.
The film quietly reinforces this sense of separation again and again, arouses emotions with the stimulation of subjective feelings, and gradually immerses the viewer's mental state into the historical scene it is to shape. Although it's realistic, it's actually full and subtle in its use of techniques to create a presence of ""body,"" as the title suggests, ""see for yourself.""
I noticed the following:
By visual drop. Such as the conversion of normal and dull tones. The first hint of this change comes at the beginning of the film, when froglia digs into a gun against a backdrop of green grass and blue sky, but then the fighter jets streak across a gray sky, and from a bird 's-eye view, the grass and trees become a gray blur.
Through the auditory drop. Such as high and low roar, from machinery (planes, motorcycles, etc.), from animals (flies, etc.) or disturbed radio waves, even physical tinnitus. The monotonous repetition of the sound made people anxious and depressed; There was the interlacing of the true and the disguised intonations -- the children who had come before froriola, speaking in a disconcerting, aged and fierce voice. Then we heard the truth of his voice again, and above all the childish words of concern to his companion: ""what's the matter? Peeing your pants?"" This seemed to confirm his real age. But even as I felt compassion for the child, I was still terrified: for the voice of the old man was beyond the range of what I could understand a child to disguise, and there was an inescapable truth in it.
As the film progresses, the signs of aging that end up on fryola's face again echo those of the well-spoken child, who is a shape-shifting sensor, spokesman and victim of the powerful violence.
Then there is the expression, the behavior, the emotional reaction, let me feel the most creepy is this. Laugh, laugh desperately, twist a cry face and still smile! Floriola and graca meet, sadness, fear, despair... There is a lot of unbearably negative emotion hidden in the neurotic dialogue, and yet they tacitly communicate with laughter and bantering. Floriola home in the emotional description of the repression to the extreme, but people can not use the word of pity or compassion to isolate themselves, to comment on it. I can only pause, pull away, and let myself think of something else. It turned out that the psychological interpretation of froriola's actions was a profound portrayal of the grief response:
1. The denial. When fryola entered the village, he felt something was wrong, but he did not want to face up to his prediction. He entered the house, ignored the whizzing of flies from the rotten food (his voice was deliberately exaggerated), and brought out the milk that had gone bad for too long to feed graca. ""It's still warm,"" he insisted. This assumes that mom and sister have been away for a short time and that everything is fine;
2. The suspect. Graca found the village head was massacred and hysterical, but froriola did not look, excitedly dragged graca into the swamp. He assumes that his family has survived their hiding on the island, but as he struggles through the mud, his flustered steps reveal the question he asks himself -- is it really all the same? Whether misfortune has befallen;
3. The anger. Arriving on the island, graca shouted the fact that his family had been massacred, and floriola attacked, strangling her and pushing her into the swamp. Still, he does not accept the reality of death, but the irrationality of this moment allows him to vent his anger towards death on his closest companions (in fact, the self-attack is directed at graca, who becomes the self-embodiment of froriola's acceptance of the reality of death).
4. Guilt. In the refuge of the island, the severely burned uncle deliriously blames fryola for digging up the guns. Although we know this is not true, fryola is also immersed in such remorse, which is mixed with the guilt of abandoning his family to join the army. He burrowed his head into the mud. When he followed the adults in search of food, the women asked him, ""don't leave us, child."" A mother with a baby in her arms consoled him: ""you never knew it would turn out like this. You never knew."" ""No, it's all my fault.""
The rough fate of floriola did not end there, foraging on the road with four people, finally left him. Rescued by an old man, he is hidden away in the village in his new identity, and the old man's rambling introduction to his family seems to ease the atmosphere, even with a touch of fantasy -- will froriola fit in with his new family? But then came the Nazi massacre.
In one detail, fryola is left behind by the army, crushing a nest of birds' eggs as he runs. This is probably the dividing line, and since then, the teenager's face has often developed the expression that trauma sufferers have. Two more photographs, one with the guerrillas, when he was a normal boy; The second time, he was photographed with a pistol held to his head by the nazis.
In the pull off state, we can say in theory that the child needs psychological intervention. But the truth is, we're watching, we're watching, we're not doing anything about it. As for myself, I can only chills and pray that I shall never be in such an environment as long as I live.
The unity and separation of emotions is an important criterion for judging schizophrenia, so we see it as abnormal when an individual's behavior and emotional response to a specific situation does not conform to our expectations. But what if the environment itself is abnormal? Every moment in the face of deprivation, the loss of loved ones, the threat of life, bad luck hovering over the head but do not know whether the next second will come... So what can we rely on? There is no such thing as normal order, that is, the collective schizophrenia, no one is immune.
The germans drove and beat the villagers to cheerful music and playful propaganda and burned them in wooden houses. Throw a baby back to the window of death like an inanimate muppet, or like a young pioneer doing a good deed, carry an old granny to her bed out of the burning place... The grotesque behavior reveals that the victorious side is also seized by fear, though not until after the exile.
I didn't like the silence of the guerrillas and the villagers at the end, watching scornfully the spectacle of the defeated side, the last volley of fire ending them, the fire thrown into the water. It seems to emphasize the moral nobility of the just side. It would be better if they acted impulsively, or even violently in return. Nico thought it was a good deal. She thought it was not that they didn't want revenge, but that they had a deep fear of the violence. Also, the maker of fear will eventually be swallowed up by fear. But why is it that humans are endlessly involved?
This film makes me strongly feel the power of art, which can not only be used to satisfy aesthetic pleasure, or passively become some kind of desire object; When it is full of energy and tends to perfect, it has a breathtaking attraction, can actively grab and capture the viewer, accurately and impressively instill its idea. It is, so to speak, both a danger and the best warning of it",

This movie is not one of those – it is beyond it. There are parts of it during which I caught myself stepping back from the immersion and almost forcefully suspending the suspension of disbelief. Such is the torment in it, but then again, that was the idea behind making this movie – to capture the horror of WWII and help us understand the scale of human destruction, physical as well as mental.

Filmmakers like Terrance Malick and Tony Scott, who use fast paced editing and dramatic monologues in the middle of their films which at times seem unnecessary.

This is my answer to those reviewers who claim that the movie is unrealistic, Soviet propaganda and so on. I will tell one story I heard from the residents of the small Byelorussian town called Starodub. They told me that during German occupation German police caught a woman who supplied information to the local partisans. She was interrogated but kept silent. Then Germans brought her to the watch-tower at the local fire station so that she could see how they will burn her house. She had three kids. Germans told her that they will throw them into the fire and let her to watch it unless she will give information about the whereabouts of the partisans. And when she refused they tied her elderly son and threw him into the fire. After that the woman jumped down from the tower committing suicide and thus saving lives of the other two kids. It is up to you to believe this story or not but I don't see the reason why the residents of the town (not just one but several) would lie to me.

152,15 December 2007,golfer06,8, Pure Realism,"""Come and See"" directed by Elem Klimov documents Nazi Germany's assault on Russia during World War II. The story centers around a young boy named Florya who has a dream-like idea about being a soldier and fighting for Russia, but his ideas of war are shattered when he gets a taste of the utter truths of what the war can entail. After seeing his family dead, he is utterly distraught and knows he cannot contain this child mentality of war anymore. We can see Florya age dramatically through the course of film, even though he is still the same boy from the beginning of the film. The experience has truly caused him to age and change and for the audience to get a new look at him at the movie's end. ""Come and See"" is truly an assault on our five senses, capturing the realistic feel in all aspects. Klimov does a fine job capturing the essence of the brutality of the war with little violence. Movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" documents more violence, blood, and SGI then actually capturing the true emotion and hardship. ""Come and See"" really focuses on emotion and the horrors of war. The scene which really is special is when Florya finally fires his gun to have a sort of epiphany and realization. Going backwards in the scene really makes it more captivating. Any of these events could be stopped if Hitler did not exist or was killed before he could let the horrendous events of the Hollacaust unfold. I really recommend this movie to truly reveal what the war is really about and how psychologically damaging it could be.",

When our young hero gets shellshocked, we voyeurs are likewise shellshocked- and the depiction of shellshock has never, as far as I know, been so realistically conveyed. (We've seen it to a lesser degree SINCE, in movies like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but never, to my knowledge, has it been handled so believably nor so uncompromisingly: the use of drifting, almost dreamlike, camera-work and uncomfortably muffled sound effects and music, combine to give us the impression WE have been shellshocked. One of the great strengths of this part of the film is its DURATION: it's not just done for a few minutes to get the idea across and then dumped: it drags on the way it would in Real Life, for fully a third of the movie.)

173,2 February 2005,Euromutt,8," Very worthwhile, though not without annoyances","Overall, I enjoyed (if that is the word) ""Idi i smotri."" The imagery is powerful, the scenery is magnificent, the military hardware is an anorak's dream, the overall plot is gripping and the climactic points in the action are nothing short of terrifying. In depicting the gruesomeness of war, this film pulls no punches whatsoever, and from that it derives a lot of its power. Even if you've seen ""Schindler's List,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" etc., this film will still shock you. The characters' motivations and thought processes are often somewhat incomprehensible, but given the situations in which they find themselves, this is understandable. However, the film is significantly longer than it needs to be, mostly because a great many scenes drag on well past the point of annoyance. Watching this film on DVD, I was mercifully able to fast forward through segments where nothing would happen for minutes at a time. Another point that niggles is the behavior of the Germans. Their almost casual brutality, even towards the Byelorussian police and militia collaborating with them, is perfectly credible. But there is a point in the film prior to which the Germans' behavior is cold and methodical (""gründlich""). Then, from one moment to the next (at the start of chapter 11 on the DVD), all discipline goes out the window and they start behaving as if they're at Club Med instead of in territory crawling with hostile partisans. This is rather jarring, and detracts somewhat from the film's credibility. All told, though, I thoroughly recommend this film, albeit it primarily to war movie buffs.",

In an amazing, almost surreal, piece of cinema technique the effect of being deafened and shocked by an artillery barrage is portrayed in the soundtrack, muffled and indistinct noises emerging from moving mouths. Apart from this personal story this piece of late Soviet film-making attempts to capture a ""typical"" atrocity of those times in the fate of another village, and largely succeeds. It ranges from the black comedy which the Soviets found in the behavior of their oppressors, a German motorcycle rides through the village with a corpse with a sign on it warning of the fate of partisans; but no-one sees it because it's raining and everyone's indoors; through exacting military historical detail - a Focke Wulf ""Owl"" reconnaissance plane slowly tracking through the sky is the recurrent motif signifying German presence - down to collaboration and partisan atrocities in turn.

200,22 August 1999,Jonah-7,10, The greatest depiction of war in film . . . ever.,"I have never been so affected by a film. At no point in my life have I hated war as much as I did throughout the watching of this film.  Now I understand why Come and See was used to educate East German students as a sort of ""Just Say No"" propaganda film against neo-Fascism.   However, while I watched it not once was there a moment of self-reference in relation to the film or intellectualizing over the mise en scène.  This is owed completely to the effectiveness of Elem Klimov's intentions.  The title, ""Come and See,""  is his direct invitation to the audience to join in the horrors of 1943 Byelorussia. We are not permitted any moment to wander through the scenery.  This is a polar contrast with Tarkovsky, who gives us the gift of time and silent contemplation as if we were reading a spiritual text.  With this film every moment is charged with a negative beat tied to an even more negative beat looming on the horizon. The sequence in the forest with Florya (Aleksei Kravchenko) and the girl (Olga Mironova) is an ominous allusion to innocent love, yet through sound and the handling of the camera we are not allowed to relax in the children's fantasy.  It suggests a traditional youth-in-love sequence, but a constant unsteadiness of camera and a cacophony of discomforting sounds mocks the viewer.  We are not allowed to find solace in their relationship, because the viewer possesses a sober omniscience of what is likely to come thus separating us from their delusion. Klimov uses unsteadiness of camera and erratic panning to keep the viewer dreading the coming events.  Even when the subject is not moving through the scene there is a subtle chaotic motion of the camera, contributing to the feeling that the very air that the characters inhabit is thick and unbearable, that to move through nature is to traverse a battlefield.",

This is probably the most devastating (war) movie I have ever experienced. That's right, you can't just see it, you experience it. The film puts its main character through such adversities and never gives any hope for things to turn better. Seemingly lighthearted scenes are sent by Oleg Yanchenko's ominous score that foreshadows the horrors coming. Even more horrifying than the brutal scenes of violence is the way we see the teenage boy grow older with one summer. At the beginning we see a young boy full of life, ready to protect his land, and by the end we only see grey and scarred human wreck. And not only physically - just look at those eyes of the boy, and how the life has been sucked out from them. The inexperience of the young actor is quite clear in some scenes in the beginning, but altogether, it is some remarkable acting. I guess the fact that the film was shot in sequence helped to improve his role. Almost like he grew with the character he portrayed. Not so fun fact - when the filming was finished, Aleksey Kravchenko's real hair had turned grey from the excruciating shooting period.",

To endure such horror and atrocity, would definitely create such a drastic distortion to anyone. To have a film, that has the ability to even convey such profound and surreal emotionmaking us, the audience, able to feel, hear, smell and perhaps taste.. is quite daunting. One must realize, that the story line perishes, and we literally feel as if we are trapped in a nightmare, in which there is no escape. Klimov's micro cosmic approach to this specific war, was quite intense; to even think he only showed one village, out of the 628 that were brutally executedto put simplyis incredibly agonizing.

It follows a young boy as he joins the Soviet Army and their efforts against the Nazis during WWII. The young boy, Florya Gaishun (played magnificently and masterfully by Aleksey Kravchenko at the age of 14 during filming), is the film's main focus, as his mentality slowly unravels the more he comes into contact with the grotesqueries of WWII. The representation of such grotesqueries is brutally honest, as his young Florya's reaction and acceptance of such horrors.

219,18 January 2021,hoggdoctor,10, In my opinion the greatest film ever made!,"This film will certainly leave you feeling empty of emotion once the final frame has finished but you will never forget this film afterwards. It is a seriously harrowing experience of emotion and sensory overload but that does not diminish the excellence of this film.
This is not your typical war film, not from the American/British type of film you may be used to. This film has no real heroes. No one bad guy. It is a cesspit of humanity at it's utmost worst, best, most real, most helpless and most terrifying all at once. I could see comparisons be made between this and Schindler's list, for both the topic and the harrowing type of film it is. Yet unlike Shindlers list this film has no 'badguy' ala Ralph Fiennes, or no 'in your face celebration of humanity' ala the ending of shindlers list. Though I feel like I must say I do think Schindler's list is an amazing film.
For the first time watching this, and I would say it may be the same for many viewers, the first 10-20 minutes may feel jarring due to a few things but I would say it is the style of filmmaking. This style of filmmaking is however what catapults this film into the greatest of all time for me though. The corruption of sound, harrowing close-ups, Surreal dialogue all make this film a little jarring at first, yet once this film pulls you in it won't let go until it is over.",

What makes it even more brutal and shocking is that fact that the whole film is shown as if throught the eyes of a young boy Flyora, a partisan, who witnesses unbearable wanton brutality, survives and becomes deeply traumatized by this.

221,19 June 2009,eric_mejia,10, A picture for all seasons!,"""Come and See"", the title of the Elem Klimov's brilliant psychological horror war picture can be definitely noted as a precursor for many of today's epic war pictures. The combination, of sight and especially sound, can bring one to feel as if they were living in war torn Belarus. The image of patriotism and the disillusionment is one to be taken home with, and thoughts are left to question acts of war and conquest. In today's day and age, with the recent speak of North Korea casing nuclear weapons, many are left to question whether it is freedom we long for, or warfare. 'Come and See,"" tells the story of a Russian boy, Floyra, who is prepared to confront the Nazis and become what he has dreamed of, a heroic patriot for his country. But soon does this innocent youth discover is that war is no petty game of guns and bullets, but a world of gruesome imagery, violence, death, loss of innocence, torment and ultimately hate for other another people. The world Floyra discovers is a world of loss, betrayal, hunger, thirst and the encounters with men and women who gain selfish freedom by the death and murders of other innocent families. A key moment in ""Come and see"" is the scene in the forest where he discovers Glasha, another girl who was left behind by the army. Upon meeting her in a morbid state, German airplanes attack their port and they run for cover and escape. Elem Klimov directs this scene with wonder in that you come to hear the perspective of Floyra, who has gone deaf as the bombs come under fire. There is nothing but a mere haunting mumble of noises with voices that sound stretched out and yawning. Elem Klimov shows his mastery to not only interweave good imagery, but great sound so that it's screeches stay with you, breath by breath. Quite possibly one of the most horrific adaptations of the Nazi War era crimes, Come and See does exactly what its title states, ""Come and See"" a life so diseased by the acts of war.",

Klimov seems to be one of those directors who likes to linger for an intolerably long time on something in order to make his point. Narratively, not a great deal happens. War really is hell, particularly for Florya, the boy-soldier who is witness to the most terrible atrocities imaginable and Klimov films the scenes of mass horror in an appallingly straight-forward fashion, (compare this with the sentimentality of Spielberg), and the final scenes are among the grimmest in all cinema. Unfortunately Klimov takes an eternity before finally taking us into the mouth of hell. At half its length and with the emphasis focused on the carnage this could have been a masterpiece.

This film in general made me really despise the Nazis more than any other films that I've seen that has to do with the Nazis. The movie had very realistic camera angle, as well as the story line. It generally gave me an idea of how much people went through during the times of World War II. My favorite part of the movie was the very last scene, where the Russian soldiers were marching on to fight against the Nazis; it generally gave the audience hope as to what's going to happen; also, when the main character steps into the crowd of the other soldiers, it reminded of the ending from the ""Bicycle Thief"" because it felt like he just moved in and disappeared into the crowd.

It's way of experiencing war not only through the eyes of a child but to actually feel how this journey changes him was one of the most horrifying as well as incredible experiences I every had. Elem Klimov managed to show the pure brutality and bestiality of war in the most incredible way I've ever seen. He not only made it possible for the audience to experience a sense of being deaf but furthermore he even makes you smell the smoke when ruthless German soldiers burn those innocent people. The most memorable scene for me was when Florya shoots at a picture of Hitler at the end thus using his pistol for the first time. After everything he had to endure this symbolic act was proof for me off how much he matured during only a few days. Ultimately he can't force himself to shoot at a picture of Hitler as a baby, which really makes you, the audience, think, not only about what would've happened if Hitler had never been born but also about the innocence of a baby and what must have happened to him in order to become such a monster.

I was really surprised because I didn't even heard about it. Came here, read this board, I thought ""Gee, this must be good"". It took one day for me to find DVD, and here I am - ready to watch. And everything went downhill since than 1) IMDb says its in Russian. Hell no, I couldn't understand a damn thing (most of the movie). It was in Belorussian or Ukranian language. I almost hugged TV just to hear some familiar words. There were no subs... I know this is not movie's problem but it gave me a really hard times 2) The whole relationship between Glasha and whatever-his-name-is was just a mess. It led nowhere. From the moment he saw her the first time - it was like was wondering why she is going with other guys and he was just sitting in a tub. It looked like he wanted more, thats what I thought. But there was no more. So I don't see why Glasha-character was even there. Also if they decided to add her - so please bother to tell what happened with her at the end (dead, missing, etc?) 3) Bad lead character development. The was no... lets say ""presentation"" of him in the beginning at all. I simply didn't care about him. It is hard to like a movie when you don't like / care about lead. 4) Some action of characters was just idiotic (first talk with Glasha in the woods, OMG. It was too strange) 5) Many posters here said about ""how great was the acting"". Didn't see that 6) Didn't feel the whole war-thing. (MAYBE is was just me) 7) The barn scene was stupid. Do you remember before the fire two people got out from the window. OK. Here comes the fire. Is it BETTER to stay inside and burn alive or you COULD at least try not get shot but go through the window??? It was about 100 or 200 people inside and all they did it's screaming? I'm not buying it. Maybe its because movie was cheap, I don't know about others but I was looking on empty barn on fire 8) I can think of more but do I really need to? I've got an idea that most of the people liked it because its Russian (kinda new, exotic, about the war). If this is the reason - I get it. For example I have a thing for danish movies, there is something magic about them for me. I didn't see any Russian people here, and I must say this movie is not very ""popular"" here in Russia.

Like most kids at that time, a young boy named Florya visions glory in protecting his land and fighting against the Nazis. After finding a gun, he leaves his family and joins a local amateur militia that dedicate themselves to protecting their land. As he gets involved in the war he soon realizes that war isn't as glorious as he thought it would be. Not until he finally is directly affected by the war he regrets ever being involved. As horrible as it might sound, I enjoyed the film. I didn't enjoy the gruesome damage that the Nazis left, but the fact that it didn't glorify war and that it isn't like most war movies. Klimov was genius enough to make this film even though it doesn't seem like it would be something that moviegoers would pay to watch. This film makes you feel as if you can almost smell the rotting corpses depicted within the film. Its easy to see that the film wasn't into the project for the money, but he was into it for the purpose of telling this terrible story. This is a film that I would recommend to a mature audience only due to the realistic blood and gore in the film.",

Come and see was a very unique war movement movie. I don't watch many, but I immediately was engaged in its premise. I was really concerned for the outcome of the boy's life. I must say the effects had me on the edge of my seat. It was visually created so well I could barely watch it. I felt I was going insane for the boy. I mean who wouldn't transition out of being norm after witnessing the terrifying events he saw? This movie was insane - but in a really creative way. From the time this movie began to the very end, I absorbed the creative teams hard work behind their assimilation of war, pain and revenge...and although a bit graphical I must say that I left with an admiration for everyones efforts.",

244,1 August 2009,maxwelllifscutz,9, come and see,"Brilliant War-based movie, in the eyes of a child who was forced to grow up. There is a paradox there however, as the child was very eager to put a rifle on and go to war- little did he know that his worst nightmares were yet to come his way. His tasks throughout the film add to his growing character, and touched me in a way that most movies do not. I especially enjoyed the part where he was dragging through the deep sinking mud, as this was actually said by the director ""go ahead and go across, i'll just film"" ( not in those exact words.) He matures throughout the movie and it is apparent in the look of his eyes. Through the evil things the Nazis are doing to innocent people, and he was one of the lucky ones to survive. It also says a lot about his character when at the end they have captured some Nazis, and he decided to shoot the picture of Hitler instead of the actual prisoners. Very well thought out movie, and I would recommend it to those seeking an action filled film.",

I felt as if I were in the scenes, whether it was an explosion, a love scene, or death scene, you were shown the results of these events happening as if it were happening to you. The use of the hand held camera made me feel as if I were actually following the protagonist step by step. The disappointment the protagonist feels when he could not deliver the cow to feed his people, I was saddened because he tried so hard and had gotten so far. The scene were the chapel is being burned down, was so emotional and scared me. Seeing this happen right before my eyes and the idea that this happened is truly tragic. The actors performances were so real. Glasha's character going crazy not knowing how to feel, act, or what to do. The protagonist not only mentally but had physical changes through out the movie. He started out as this naive boy and grew into a man who has seen everything. This film was possible because of perestroika and glasnost and marks a new beginning for Russian film making. I am glad I got to see it.",

This film tells the story of a boy of fourteen years, Florya , who joins the Russian army in their efforts to defeat the Nazis. His excitement at going to war in the beginning of the film is enough to make you want to get out of your chair, somehow penetrate the screen, and slap him into realizing what he's about to have to witness—and worse—do.

A type of unreal-realism that makes you question human nature, giving you a first hand view of the ugly impact war has on civilians. The protagonist is dropped at the center of the alarmingly morbid war, where he immediately witnesses death again and again. A paralyzing view which shows the unpublished secrets of the war, and the side most important and compelling amongst the madness; the innocent. After coming out of this movie you can't help but feel exposed to the true curse of war. Raw and symbolic, there is no sugar-coating to be found.",
249,8 August 2009,decembernaghi,10, Utterly stunning in its mesmerizing storytelling,"Elem Klimov's ""Come and See"" is possibly the most moving film I have ever seen. As a war movie, it is unique in its genre in my opinion. It engages the audience with all five senses in its nightmarish reality. The war came to life right in front of my eyes. When the first bombs erupted around Florya and Glasha, the use of sound made me feel like I was right there. I smelled the rotting bodies when Florya came back to his hometown and all he saw was flies and bowls of soup. I felt the slimy grip of the marshes when he dragged Glasha through them as he fought the idea that his entire family was dead. During the most harrowing and excruciatingly miserable part of the movie, when the Russian village was burned to the ground with the people inside, I felt the fear and pain and panicked helplessness. I wanted to cry out, to scream, to run. In the burning farmhouse, I wanted to claw my way out. I felt the terrifying responsibility of having to decide whether to take the chance to jump out the window or risk staying inside. My throat was dry, my body went from hot to cold to hot again. I shivered and I felt the burn of heat. While the disconcerting use of close-ups made it almost painfully intimate, the movie was all the more haunting because Florya was only one of thousands experiencing the same and worse. By the time Florya was shooting the picture of Hitler and using his gun for the first time, I felt battered and burned, exhausted and deeply disturbed, but also oddly satisfied. Though shooting Hitler's picture was just a symbol, it really made me think. What if Hitler had been killed as a baby? Would that be wrong? It made the film feel more well-rounded. I felt like I'd lived an entire lifetime in the space of a few hours. It was a truly remarkable film. I've never seen anything like it, and I don't think I ever will again.",

251,3 August 2009,jnine31,7, great European auteurs,"Do not watch this movie light heartedly, possibly with a alcoholic beverage (it might help ease the pain). Klimov does an amazing job of jolting the audience and showing how close to annihilation we were when the Nazi's were trying to take over. Set in Byelonessia 1943, a little boy is digging in hopes of finding guns or grenades that have been left behind. He finds a rifle, which he is so happy about, but doesn't realize the events that have been set by him now trying to be a solider. Klimov does an excellent job of showing ""glasnost"", creating a vertical relationship with the audience, and a holds no bar kind of feeling. The audience experiences everything with the Flor, from his hearing loss when the bombs go off, to swimming through the mud. You feel disgusting and want a shower as you watch this. All and all though, it is the triumph of the human spirit that shines through. Flor is put into unimaginable situations, where he must survive, grieve his family members who have all be killed, and become an adult before he is fully ready. There is a scene, where Flor finds bandages, and tries to bandage his rifle (as if that is going to fix it) but it is from a little boy's mentality who is obviously not really ready to take all this on. The Hitler Montage in the end, is perfect way to create another vertical relationship with the audience. It starts with images of men found in Nazi camps, and runs through everything down to the baby picture of Hitler. It makes you question and think, babies are suppose to be harmless and adorable. But this baby is responsible for killing thousands and thousands of people!",

It made me sleep with unease for 3 nights straight. Klimov captured every emotion out of me in: I laughed, I cried, I screamed, I yelled, I clenched my teeth. This movie also teased my 5 senses: I tasted the mud in the swamp as Florya and Glasha were struggling to get across. I smelt the fire from barn in the small village, while people were burning inside, and Nazis were laughing. I heard the flies buzzing around Florya's home giving off a sense of death, decay, and abandonment. I saw Florya go from the primal immature young boy, to an old man in a matter of days. I could feel the hardship, the sadness, the love that Florya felt for Glasha, and the Resistance coming to life. ",

However, it carries a strong message and is filmed in a way that makes it feel incredibly real. Things I read and heard such as the guns being fired with live ammunition strengthens the realism even more. I also appreciated details such as when the protagonist Florya goes deaf from explosions and the way the director lets us understand it. All in all an incredibly good movie about an incredibly horrible time of which we all bear a responsibility of never forgetting. If you are to only see one WWII movie, choose this one. PS. I felt sorry for the cow.",
254,24 July 2012,Pkleddick,10, Not your average Hollywood war film.,"Before viewing this film, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I knew it was not going to be like many of the other war movies out there. So many of the American war movies lean so much closer to the formalism aspect of the scale compared to realism, and as many say they are so ""Hollywood"". Klimov did an amazing job of keeping his film out of that category. I have never really been able to empathize with characters in a war movie the way I have with this film. It was not so much that I have personally endured what Flyora went through, but that he was such a young boy being forced into a grown world. I think the part of this film that affected me so much was watching this boy age physically and mentally so much in such a short period of time. The visual aspect of Flyora's transformation really hit me as the viewer emotionally. Comparing him from the start of the film as a fairly healthy and happy young boy, to a white haired, bags under his eyes, wrinkled boy who's soul has been sucked out of him, is hard to accept even just as a viewer to this movie. This film was so realistic, with no CGI and rawness, it seeped into my thoughts more so than many Hollywood films I have ever seen.",
255,9 December 2011,slatergrey,10, One of the most powerful war films ever.,Come and See is one of the most powerful war films of all time. Between the cinematography and sound design this movie takes you for an unrelenting journey and doesn't let go. The main character is thrust into war for the Russians where he quickly learns the destruction and real horror of war. The beauty of this film is in its completely realistic approach. You lose grasp of you're reality and plunge yourself into this film. Once the chaos begins in this film it never lets you go. The viewer is put into a hypnosis or dream and there is no way out. To me this movie is one of the most powerful war films because of it's message. It doesn't glorify war at all. It brings war down to it's grittiest and most gruesome it could ever be. This movie made me feel the pain of these people engaged in this war. It made me feel anger that people brought this type of horror and destruction to humanity. I was engaged with every feeling the lead character went through. All in all it was an amazing experience. My favorite war film of all time.,
256,9 February 2012,oshapiro24,10, A true story of World War II,"If there was a single movie that showed so much emotion, hardships, pain mentally and physically it was ""Come and See"". This movie truly showed the world how eastern Europeans fought and what they endured in order to protect their land from the Nazis. Taking place in Belarus, Florya did not show himself as a heroic soldier who fought for freedom and justice. Rather the 13 year old boy showed the audience what it means to be a boy in war torn Belarus. There was no heroism, no dramatic or artificial killing scenes done by Florya. He simply displayed the psychological and emotional pain that he endured as did the many other villagers. The goal of the movie was not to lavishly portray the Russians and fellow eastern Europeans defeating the Germans but rather show the fight that each soldier had on and off the battlefield. Both of my grandfathers served in the Red Army and fought in Belarus. This movie had one of the biggest impact of my life. I felt proud to be a native Russian because this movie was not propaganda movie. This movie showed the fighting spirit in an average boy. If I were to place myself in the same situation, I suspect I would be no different than Florya. Elem Klimov said : ""I understood that this would be a very brutal film and that it was unlikely that people would be able to watch it. I told this to my screenplay coauthor, the writer Ales Adamovich. But he replied: ""Let them not watch it, then. This is something we must leave after us. As evidence of war, and as a plea for peace."" One must never forget the tragedy and the great costs that took defending one's land from invaders. This movie calls for peace because in such a situation a young boy loses his innocence, his childhood in a brutalizing way. We must never forget the horrors. ""Come and See"" truly gave the world the true perspective of how people fought and the costs that they had to pay to be free. For me personally, this movie will always be engraved in my heart and mind.",

The shots are as beautiful as they are horrifying. What starts as an innocent curiosity transforms into a humbling sequence of terrifying events that push the boundaries of sanity.

What is impressive about this movie is that it is 100% real, everything that happens is real and that is very obvious to the viewer which is why it is so beyond moving. This is a movie that will not leave anyone unaffected seeing that, even though it is fictional, all of what happens in this movie actually happened in history, but in an even bigger scale. This is what is frightening and what creates the feeling of unease. Klemov does not leave anything to the imagination of the viewer but show in a brutal way just what the Nazis did to the villages and the people in Byelorussia at the time which is a clever way to prevent the reader from ever being completely able to think that ""this is just a movie"".

263,13 June 2009,marky2882,10, One of the Most Unnerving Films I have Scene in a While,"This film was heartbreaking in the way it showed this wide eyed, child turn into an old man due to the violence and cruelty he witnesses. The expressions on his face as the movie progresses go beyond make up and it's clear that his soul, as well as his face, age drastically through each horrific experience he has to endure. The film made me feel anxious, especially the scene where Florya and Glasha are left behind as the rebels march off to ATTEMPT to battle and defeat the Germans. As soon as the bombs go off and we, as the audience, hear as Florya hear, the ringing and terror and isolation set in. It made me feel as though I were experiencing it firsthand for myself. It only got more intense for me as the movie goes on. It had a crazed, manic feel to it, and I couldn't stand Glasha's insanity, I truly despised her character. Two of the most horrific scenes for me, were when Glasha and Florya return to his village and Glasha looks back to see almost the entire population of the small community massacred, with their bodies piled on top one another like animals. That scene was nothing however, to the image of the young blonde woman who, in another doomed village, had been gang raped by the German soldiers after she had been dragged by the hair into the back of their military vehicle. I will never forget the image of that woman walking awkwardly toward Florya while blowing a whistle hanging out of her mouth, with blood running down her legs and her mouth bruised and bloody. I couldn't help but think that her fellow neighbors had had a more merciful death burning with each other in the town hall. Seeing her, all alone, completely out of it and obviously not being able to process what had just happened to her was too much to bear. All I could think as I watched this scene was that at least they had died with each other, and here was this poor woman, who had not only been repeatedly violated, but had been witness to her children, neighbors and family murdered, and it is she that is one of the only ones left alive, albeit barely, to bear the burden of these losses.",

The movie too making you aware of that the Holocaust was not the whole story about World War II. Watching this movie, you certainly will use all of your five senses! The movie starts with a very powerful scene where Florya is taken away to a camp in a Belarussian village to serve in the war. Florya is naively excited about going out in the war but as the story progress he comes to understand that war is not at all heroic, neither about glory, but about suffering and death. When Florya comes to the camp as a ""new comer"" he is humiliated by that he cannot go out in the war and needs to leave his shoes to someone that needs them better. After the soldiers left the camp, he walks into the wood and cries, and meets Glasha who just been left by her boyfriend that is going out in the war. Glosha is as heartbroken as Florya is and in this emotionally loaded scene, Glosha says ""I want to Love"" I want to have babies"" , which are words that capture something that many people probably lost- their hopes and wishes about life and love. Right after they meet, a bomb falls over them. They survive but stick together as long as possible. The morning after, they go home to Florya to find that his sisters and his mother have been killed along with hundreds of other people of the village, lying in a stack just outside his house. It is a horrible scene, hard to stop think about even after the movie is over. Florya not only grows up emotionally but is aging several years in a two days time! The gun that he so proudly carried in the beginning hasn't been used a single time, except in the very last sequence of the film where he founds a portrait of Hitler in the ruins of the village. Here, a montage like scene is tracing back the most significant events of the Second World War, all the way back to when Hitler was an infant in his mother's lap. This is a very memorable scene and the fact that Florya doesn't shoot may have multiple interpretations, especially since the time is meant for us to reflect over this ourselves. However, seeing this scene, you instantly thinking back to the scene in where hundreds of people were locked in a building and killed but a comment from a soldiers says: ""Those without children can leave"", ""It all starts when you are a child"", may suggest that Florya's choose to not kill the infant Hitler which would essentially go against such a revelation.",

The difficult journey in the swamp and the selective blindness after landing on the island, the Hitler skeleton possessed by the god of death, and the dying bull's eye looking at the absurd world are all handled with metaphors and visual impact. The end is wonderful, and the anger that shoots causes time to go back, but if everything can be done again, will the world change?

The last war that was fought actually IN the United States was the Civil War (us fighting ourselves nearly 150 years ago). Of course, how can we understand what it's like for people in Iraq when we come into their country and bomb their homes and kill innocent people (sometimes women and children) in the process? Unlike ""Saving Private Ryan"" and many other war films that use extensive choreographed battle sequences, ""Come and See"" manages to show the horrors of war without glorifying violence at the same time. Through the use of incredible young actors and devastating scenes that engage all the senses, ""Come and See"" causes the viewer to lose their own innocence and gradually question their own sanity as they share Florya's journey into the agonizing horrors of war.

You feel Florya's transformation from being this young excited child to being a tired soulless kid who aged right in front of your eyes in such a short period of time. I think the director captured the struggles and emotions of being in this war. It pretty much takes the life out of you. I felt the emotions as I was watching the film. A glimpse of the dead bodies stuck in my mind even as I write this and that scene was less than a second. The ringing sound that still lingers in my ear whenever I think about the scene that the Nazi bombs were falling and Florya temporary losing his hearing.

279,14 June 2009,Short_Stufff,10," Painful to watch, yet definitely powerful.","This is a war movie unlike any other I have seen. What makes this movie different from other war movies that have been produced recently, is that this movie relies on its sheer power and message to move the viewer as opposed to blood, gore and explosions. This is not to say that the movie does not have any substantial explosions or scenes that would certainly keep you up at night, the scene that comes to mind for me is the burning barn scene. Yet the beauty and genius lies in the way the director Elem Klimov demonstrates restraint in what he shows his audience. By leaving certain things for the audience to make out for themselves, he makes this movie much more painful yet powerful.",
280,21 May 2022,DarkSpotOn,9, Amazing. Come And See! War Masterpiece.,"This movie fails under the same boat as The Nanking Massacre, Men Behind The Sun, Dara of Jasenovac, Grave of the Fireflies, and Downfall. This was amazing. The movie is 2 hour long, but God Damn it's sure worth it! I loved this movie. The movie is about a Young soldier that leaves his family, in order to go to war. Well, the army goes without him, because he was too young, or something by those lines. So he goes and mets up with a chick he never bet before, they become friends, nearly a couple. They go back to his house, to see that nobody is there. The young soldier thinks that his family is still alive, but the chick sees from behind that everyone was killed, including his two little sisters. The soldier goes insane, and can not believe what the chick was saying. Later on, the soldier meets up with other village, and he along four other soldiers, go to find food for the people, sadly they fail, dye to the Germans attacking them, they took a cow, which got killed by the Germans. All of the men died, except our main hero. The hero then mets up with an old man, that is doing his work. Well they go back to his village, where the Germans literally lure innocent Russians, that they will get rescued, which escalates in all of them getting killed inside of a big church, or house. In the end, the chick comes back full bloody, as she got abused, most likely sexually by the Germans, that scene was terrifying, i must say. In the end, some (i think the main leader) or something by those lines, ended up getting killed by Russians, and real footage of victims play out. This movie was Amazing, you never get bored, and this is how it should be done, this is how Full Metal Jacket should of done it.",
281,16 June 2009,pillowman,10, The face of horror,"This has become one of my favorite war movies. The face of the protagonist still echos in my head as he watches a church full of people burn to the ground; or as he realizes that his family has been murdered; or in the most intense and abstract of scenes, when he gazes down upon the picture of Hitler and fires his gun for the first time as a mélange of war footage is interwoven with his disturbed expression. Many times throughout the film Klimov's use of sound creates an intense overwhelming feeling which almost literally makes me feel the anxiety that the characters must be experiencing in the scene. A good example is when the protagonist realizes his family is dead and unites with the surviving villagers. There is an effective use of disorienting sounds that really do start to make you feel like the world is collapsing around you. What sticks with you the most after seeing this movie is probably its depiction of the reality of war. In so many ways this movie puts Saving Private Ryan to shame (still an awesome movie) where we get a bunch of high paid heads to make us ""feel"" for them through acting. Rather, in ""Come and See"" we get the opposite, very few, low paid actors. The ""feel"" then comes from the directing style and the directors voice.",

284,16 June 2009,rljslaughter,9, frighteningly truthful and terrifying,"""Come and See"" is a frighteningly truthful film about war and the horrors that take place in it. This film is not extremely graphic on screen but in your mind. The most terrifying things that happen in this movie, are left up to the viewer to imagine. This, I think, is an amazing way to get into the audience's head and under their skin. You do not see the people burning in the barn, you just see the barn burning. Yet we were just in the barn, and even though we escaped with Florya (the main character) your heart is still racing because you feel as if you were in the barn with the rest of the people. You can't smell a movie, yet you gag at the revolting stench of the swamp or dolls in Florya's house. Your not a character, yet you are scared for your life at the sight of the pile of bodies, you feel amazingly luckily not to be blown to bits by a mine. You've only meet the German minutes before (and you my think of yourself as a decent human being a would never do anything the Nazis did) but you clench your teeth, praying to see them burn to death, and you are almost broken hearted when they aren't. You don't just watch this film or listen to it, you don't even just live it. You survive it. You thank you luck stars that you are still physically in on piece.",

287,15 June 2009,ginaneves31,10, One of the Most Realistic Portrayals of the Savagery of War,"Come and See, a Russian film that touches on the dreadful experiences the Russian citizens underwent during the Nazi German invasion of World War II. Elem Klimov, the director of the movie, illustrates a captivating story by bringing to life all of the five senses of the viewer. Klimov, through filming with a hand-held camera and through the use of authentic settings and props, captures beautifully the smell, sound, sight, taste, and touch of each scene. This allows the audience to be able to experience the film as if they were really there. The film focuses on the main character Florya, a boy from a small Russian village. Florya is accompanied by a girl named Glasha after he is called upon to help the Russians defend themselves from the Nazi invasion. Due to circumstances beyond their control, these two young individuals are forced to wander the Russian wilderness while, at the same time searching for Florya's family. Florya and Glasha fight for their survival as they witness the death of many villagers. Their encounters allow the audience to witness the physical and psychological horrors brought upon by the Nazi's invasion of Byelorussia. Florya, after finding other survivors and finding out that his family is dead, realizes that he is temporarily deaf and goes off with a support team in search for food to help the other survivors. During his journey, he encounters appalling experiences as he tries to stay alive. The boy, Florya, continues to keep his life through pure luck as his life is spared over and over again. Klimov, through his powerful imagery and through the use of Mozart's Requiem in the closing scene, gives the viewer a true sense of the atrocities that took place during World War II.",
288,27 July 2012,foroutan_jasmine_lea,10, Inglorious War,"This movie was the perfect way to show the reality of what war is. It's not glorious; it's not all about being a hero for your country; and it's not about honor. It's extremely hostile, brutal, violent, traumatizing, and heart wrenching. As a regular citizen you only see the ""honorable"" side of it; but as soldier or even a family member of a soldier you know otherwise. ",
289,15 June 2009,shishonia,10," Wow, great!","In 'Come and See', one could watch the ugliness of war through the main character Floyra. For instance, after the bombs dropped in the forest, Florya lost his hearing. The audience hears the sound perspective of Florya when there is a loud ringing noise and muted sound of words. Other sounds the audience hears are echoing words and/or erratic noises. It feels dream like with muffled noise and bits of music here and there. Surprisingly enough, there is no voice over narrative (because we are so in tune to Florya and his experience).",
290,16 June 2009,kandylova19,8, Emotional Roller-coaster,"This film depicts the historical significance of the Nazi German invasion of a small town in Russia. As we are invited to ""come and see"" the horror and trauma a village encounters, we are only given a taste of the large scale disaster. With unforgettable scenes, Elem Klimov puts forth a great effort to capture the audience and take them through an emotionally exhaustive but equally important roller coaster ride. The cast includes a group of talented actors who are able to express the intensity of their emotions through limited dialog and powerful facial expressions. As difficult as it is to witness this terrible genocide, this film is one that deserves our undivided attention.",
291,10 September 2012,jboothmillard,5, Come and See,"I know most of the titles from the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die pretty well, some have remained in my memory that I have either seen or have been meaning to see and remember the titles, and this Russian / Belarusian film was one of the titles I remember reading and wanted to see. Basically set in 1943, during World War II, this film follows young Belorussian boy Florya Gaishun (Aleksey Kravchenko) who is thrust into the brutal and atrocious world of the war happening. He is forced into joining the fight with the Soviet resistance who are hardly equipped at all and feel hopeless because of this, and going against the savage German forces becomes more dangerous as they invade the various countries. Florya witness terrifying and horrifying situations such as fellow soldiers killed in action, many explosions and all forms of violence, and with all this happening he slowly loses his youthful innocence, and more importantly his mental state. The end sees him truly lose his mind when it all seems to be over for him, having been through all the brutal events, and he simply looks at a photograph of Adolph Hitler, he sees flashes of his rise to power in reverse, and finally having a weapon he attacks this photograph. Also starring Olga Mironova as Glasha, Liubomiras Lauciavicius as Kosach and Vladas Bagdonas. Kravchenko gives a great dark performance as the boy who goes through absolute hell and naturally loses the plot until he is pretty much completely broken down, the film has good use of colour to create mood, there is some impressive camera-work during the battle sequences and travelling through the woods, and the war sequences filled with violence and suspense are suitably gripping, so although there are the odd slow moments and it can be hard to understand all going on, overall it is a hard hitting terrific enough epic drama. It was number 71 on The 100 Greatest War Films, and it was number 21 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Worth watching!",

The movie absolutely is branded on your memory, and it doesn't let you go. This is something very important you should watch and understand before supporting the War in Iraq. This is absolute realism. On the other hand, you never meet such a movie in Hollywood. A young boy gradually understands the real during the war. What he experiences is pretty dramatic: death of his family, many of dead bodies, slaughter, rape, and many paralyzed hearts. His experience represents the victims.

The handful difficult situations and sufferings that I have been through in my lifetime does not even compare to what these poor people had to go through. It is awful, horrible and traumatizing and those survivors' hearts and souls are marked for a lifetime. That memory of the act of inhumanity by the Nazis will never go away from their minds. It just brings about so many questions. Why did the Nazis think they were better than anybody else and have to commit murder? Why did Hitler come up with this ridiculous idea? It just makes me so angry to know that there are people that have this mentality of being better than others and have to kill them in a brutal way. The film was very difficult to watch because there is no happiness what so ever and its very disturbing and full of tragedy. To me the filmmaker obviously made this film because this tragedy remains in his mind and it has not been forgotten. It is a historical film for all who know about it and for the newcomers that are arriving into this world.",

From the beginning, you begin to wonder what is this movie about? All you see are two boys playing in the sand and pretending to be soldiers and you might think that it will be a movie about war.

It's quite the history lesson too, where I've never heard the side of what the Russians went through during WWII. Every time there's a bit of relief or some hope, it's immediately crushed, so much stress that the main character faces, that it starts to put you in that state and even worried if the next scene that if he'll even make it or if there will be something else horrific. The fact that this young boy sought out this gun and carried with him almost throughout the film, it was like his curse. When he finally fires, you get to experience an aggressive montage with a final image that most people haven't seen and its amazing the way it was put together.

302,2 August 2010,Aristides-2,5, Hugely uneven WWII film,"There are scenes taking place that appear to be non-sequiturs; several lightly armed Russians going to some distant 'warehouse' to secure food in the boonies after their particular village has been savagely attacked (though there's no explanation provided to explain how so many villagers escaped the Nazi extermination regiment that left a mound of bodies next to a walled house on the outskirts of town.). Then we cut to a scene where the same men are running for their lives seemingly pursued only by a fixed and unseen machine gun's bullets. Not a clearly thought out scene! Another: Florya and a companion have requisitioned a cow. Suddenly massive tracer-laden machine gun fire inundates the area the three are in but the only casualty is one of the men. Question: How do you miss a standing cow in the field? (Answer: The cow is then killed for better theatrical value.) The director, Klimov, born in 1933, seems to never have seen a movie. How else to explain long, long static shots of people that provide no additional information about them. He's also deficient in any editing aesthetic after 1919; Mr. Klimov: your time is our time and you waste much of it in shots that need editing. Even the extraordinary section of the movie showing the horror of the destruction of the village.....and it is an extraordinary war horror section.....has a scene where a Nazi officer, about to die a violent death, delivers pure pedantic-inspired dicta. Propaganda, not reality and the scene stops cold in its tracks while this character speaks. The reverse-images montage near the end is something the illiterate and unschooled Florya couldn't possibly have been exposed to. Why hang this lecture on the kid? Yes, a powerful film but heavily uneven.",

Ever since then, I cannot get some of the images out of my head. For me, this is one sign of great film making. In particular, there is a scene in which the protagonist and another partisan steal a cow late at night from a farmer who is (apparently) collaborating with the Germans. The farmer discovers the theft before they have had time to get very far and summons the Germans. The Germans can barely make out the silhouette of the cow in the distance across the vast Belorussian fields (close to a mile away or more!) and begin firing. The pair takes cover behind the cow as numerous tracers fly horrifyingly close overhead. Eventually the tracers depress closer and closer to the ground and the cow is hit by a number of them and goes down. The camera hovers over the cow's eye as the life runs out of it. I am convinced that real ammunition was used and a live cow was actually shot on camera. I cannot adequately convey the surreal horror depicted in this scene. Nor can I quite put my finger on why the scene struck me so powerfully. It has remained with me ever since. There are numerous other moments like that throughout this masterwork, which linger in the memory. I cannot recommend this film highly enough, although it is not for the faint-of-heart. If you have the chance to see it on the big screen especially, DO NOT pass it up! Be forewarned though--you will be utterly shaken to the core. This film may be unrivaled in its depiction of the absolute horror and futility of war.",

Most have not gone through what he experiences in Come and See. The first image is of an old man who is slyly employing reverse psychology to get the boys to stop digging for weapons. He screams himself hoarse like a withered drill sergeant; later as he is found covered in burns inflicted by the Germans, he again heeds his warning, but it is too late. There is no doubt he speaks from experience - he knows the war's terrors, but perhaps he also knows the childlike excitement of playing guns and wanting to march off to defend his country. He, like Flyora's mother, is trying desperately to stop this vicious cycle. She acts exasperated at Flyora's antics, and his desire to join the troops. He is given the old 'act like an adult' treatment as she tells him to brandish the gun and kill them now (because him going off to war would mean the same thing). But as soon as the dream becomes reality Flyora is once again her baby boy, and she whimpers and tries to coddle and hold onto him in vain. ",

The film follows 12-year-old Florya (executed brilliantly by newcomer Alexei Kravchenko), who anxiously awaits life as a soldier for the Russian Army in 1943 Byelorussia. However his fantasy rapidly comes to an end as he comes face to face with the brutal realities of war and bears witness to some of the most terrible atrocities imaginable. The film relies heavily around haunting images and sound, and Klimov so vividly portrays Florya's descent into madness that by the end of the film we ourselves feel as though we have lost our minds.

The boy, joins the movement against Hitler and is thrown on a few day journey in which he ages grossly. The scenes are frightening as is the landscape which is at times scarier than the battle scenes which is partly what makes this film so unique.

Your heart always hurts when you hear about the war but this film makes you feel like you are there experiencing it in the moment.

319,25 July 2011,MariaXtinaBenthall,9, Real Wartime,"There is this one shot in ""Come and See"" where Florya, the movie's main character steps on a nest of eggs and we are shown this short shot of dead wet chicks in the middle of the mud moss. This tiny maybe 3second shot was so unbelievably powerful I felt sick for the next ten minutes. I watched an interview with Director Elem Klimov after I watched the movie. There was no way that the male actor that played Florya was mentally stable after such a horrific journey of war in this movie - Klimov explained that he used hypnosis during filming to make sure the actors were not affected. It made me think how different the movie would be if it was made in now time - there would be restrictions, laws and Klimov would have probably had to restrain his creative urges. The other thing Klimov mentioned in the interview was that the movie was originally going to be called ""Kill Hitler"" - Hitler standing for your inner demons. This theme that every one has a Hitler inside them that they fight constantly every day. Each person with a different battle. ""Come and See"" is literally a descent to hell. It is the only war movie where I have wholly felt like I was there - experiencing this horrific real war time of Nazi hell. Klimov gives us this microscopic view - He shows us the scale of things and the reality check that war is for small villages. By the end of the movie we are shown that it is the rag tag armies of these villages who are the ones that defeated the Nazis. It was bizarre to me how I felt a sense of hope through this revelation at the end. When Mozart's ""Requiem"" is playing at the end and we are shown this shot of just snow I felt this huge sense of relief. The fact that there were no humans or any man-made object in the shot, just snow, made me feel like finally I could breathe. Rebirth. A new beginning. Another chance at life. My favorite aspect of the movie was the use of sound. The music was an interesting choice - Mozart is most often looked at as beautiful and calming which is the complete opposite of what is depicted in the movie. My personal association with Mozart was also peaceful and it bothered me when I realized Mozart's music was being used through this heart-wrenching sick war movie. About three quarters of the way through, I realized it was probably Mozart that got me through the movie - That helped me through war. There was also this very small and constant sound of a buzzing fly - I was constantly irritated by this. I know this is what Klimov was aiming for and so I applaud him for the effect but I felt like shooting someone myself! Klimov's bravery as a Director was phenomenal. There was no fear of the truth and there was no fear in shoving the truth down the viewer's throat. We are taken on a journey with Florya - Klimov gives his character a huge arch and by the end we too like Florya feel a reason to fight - a reason to join - an explanation of what victory is. I would recommend this movie for the tough-hearted or anyone that is searching for the truth of our world.",

The film begins with the young Florya ( Aleksei Kravchenko ) searching an old battle ground for a discarded rifle that he hopes to use in the fight against the invading Nazi army. His dreams are nothing more than a child wanting to play soldier. His innocence warms our hearts and yet frightens us because we know this inexperienced young boy can't stand against Hitler's ruthless regime.",

323,2 May 2005,FADrury,7, A Witness to Atrocity,"This film follows the path of a young boy as he confronts the incredible brutality of the partisan war in the Soviet Union during WW II. The film starts with the boy joyfully going off to join the partisans while his mother shrieks with fear. However, when the partisan band heads off, he's left behind due to his youth and innocence. As a result, he becomes a witness to the atrocities visited upon his village and others nearby by a wandering einsatzgruppen unit that takes great pleasure in its grisly task of extermination. The film is episodic and takes some unusual turns (the effort to put up the dummy German is one). This is film about images, not words. There is remarkably little dialogue throughout much of the film. It's also brutal and graphic. A great deal of the horror of this films comes from the simple joy (and conviction) that the Germans bring to their goal of wiping out the population.",
324,1 August 2010,inoka_marques,10, Come and See Review,"This is a masterpiece of war movies. Come and See takes us with the main character, Florya, to another ""world"". We can feel those character pains and struggles. Come and See is the warranty that we fight for no reason, and while in war our life have no meaning, and we give up our lives in order to fight for reasons that ""have no reason"". The psychologist horror is more painful to watch than the physical violence. The movie is so real and ""touches"" all of the audience senses that we forget that we are actually just watching a movie. In my opinion, the end of the movie is absolutely brilliant, superb. Watching the ""flashback"" of Hitler's life until his picture as a baby, a baby just like many other that died because of him and his Nazi's ideals.",

If I had to see which group was the Ant/Pro in the film.

This one is tough, and if it wasn't so damn good I probably would stay away from it. While I'm sure other movies out there top Come and See as far as violence and artificial shock values go, Come and See is the real deal. War films tend to go toward either extreme subjectivity or for complete objectivity, which both have their uses, but Come and See blends the two together into something uniquely cinematic. War films come and go, with few of them leaving a mark on the audiences psyche. Come and See is a rough and wild ride that more than leaves a mark.",
328,10 February 2012,Natali_galindo,9, This is War,"Wow. This film was the best depiction of War I've seen so far, in no way at all did this film glamorize it, if anything it gave the audience the closest look into what a country under attack goes through. Unlike other war films Come and See really depicted the life's of ordinary civilians in the time of war. The small town of Russia were Flor was from resembled the country itself, it was micro-cosmic view of the point of view of the Russians during world war II. The director Elem Klimov did an amazing job in getting the audience involved with almost your five senses, we can practically smell old meat when the cow that Flor was trying to take to the group dies for example. The sound of the constant Nazi planes watching over haunted us as much as Flor. I was recently part of a house fire and the scene when the German officers terrorize the Russian city and burn the building with all the townspeople was unforgettable, it gave me chills to remember my own close experience with the fire but seeing it in this film took it to another level. A few minutes ago before the fire we got to see the inside full with people who had done nothing wrong. The flames were no CGI which made the scene that much more intense. ",

I have never been a fan of any kind of war violence movies but this one was so different. It made me feel as if I was really there experiencing the entire thing. Klimov's directing was just amazing. So brilliantly done that it has impacted the way I look at war in general. I love how Klimov made the beginning at an easy going pace showing bits of happiness and joy, but then the movie took a complete turn and became so disturbing and outrageous. I had my hand over my mouth and my eyes began to water at times and I just kept thinking about how horrible everything that was happening to this poor boy was. I kept thinking about how sad it is that humans are capable of doing such horrible things and after the movie I felt really distraught and sad. These feelings carried on until the next day and I even had nightmares from watching it. It is really hard to find a movie that can impact you so greatly in that way and Klimov nailed it!",

For Aleksey Kravchenko, being a young boy acting in such circumstances, carrying on the emotional and painfully feelings of the main character Florya, he did an amazing job, I really believed his pain.

It was brutal to watch but I was very thankful for that, no one wants to see the war sugar coated. The soundtrack was equally as impacting as it complimented what was going on on screen perfectly.

After thinking about it I realized that this is one of these films I liked but would never watch again. I think that he really made this film as a film about war should be. I have seen so many films about war where I enjoyed watching war happen in front of my eyes and if so, the film is probably not very realistic. In almost all film about historical wars, it seems like it was this fantastic great victory and everyone was happy. I think that Elem Klimov tries to show us that there are no such thing as a happy ending in wars. The people who experienced it will have scars for life. The reason why I felt so uncomfortable watching it was that he made it so real. I felt this panic all the time and as Florya tries to escape the Nazi's, I wanted to escape to. I think that this is what makes it so important, to tell us who never experienced war what it is really like.

Not that we do not know war, but they way he shows it is amazing, the colors, the camera movement e.t.c.

The first words, ""Are you crazy?"" ring out as 2 young children are seen digging in the sand. The story centers on Florya, a twelve-year-old boy that wants to join the partisans.

Glasha invites you to visit the portal of death and Klimov follows Florya and Glasha like ""Hansel and Gretzel,"" as if the camera is an eye witness to what is happening; the audience and the camera have joined forces with Florya. The camera is no longer a camera, but a living, breathing person. We witness with Florya the non-stop suspension of his disbelief--the breakdown and breakthrough of a fourth wall every breathing moment of his life. We see, we feel, we hear for Florya.

Growing up learning about my Jewish history, automatically I connect World War II with the holocaust. This movie did a great job in reminding me and making people aware that the Jews in the Holocaust were not the only people devastated by the horrific acts of the Nazis. Watching this movie, I certainly was unable to keep my eyes open 40% of the time due to terrible things we had to witness! It all begins with a naive young boy named Florya who is ignorantly excited about going to serve in the war simply because he wants to shoot a gun, just like any typical young boy would.

Floria takes us with him as war is forced upon his conscience for the first time in the most brutal, realistic, cold and hypnotic way. Just the same way we are misled by a false representation of soldiers as heroes, Floria's delusion of becoming a hero of war is quickly realized. His innocence is stolen forever and his spirit will be eternally crushed by the presence of the greatest evil man has ever come to know. Klimov captures the devastating monstrosity of the unfeeling Nazi troops as they round up Jews like sheep and celebrate the extermination of each and every one of the villagers. With scenes the viewer can almost smell, Klimov creates a very real experience as we feel the wounds this historic act of pure evil has left opened, gouging a deep hole into our history as a people.

Forgive me for being a killjoy here, but after viewing this film, I was simply left with a feeling of ""Really?"". The character of the boy doesn't seem developed enough and the imagery presented in some so-called ""intense"" scenes did not truly attract my attention nor made me empathize with the character.

343,9 February 2011,vahak30,9," WAR, a psychological game of oppression and conflict.","Elem Kulimov's thriller about war and human conflict is definitely a movie that will stick with the viewer undoubtedly forever. Usually war movies are done in either tow ways, one being the ""Saving Private Ryan,"" way of glory, valor, and determination; or in this case a more realistic and often actual representation of war, depression, despair, and hopelessness. The movie does a magnificent job at demonstrating the human psyche and outlook on life when war is upon one's country, the agony and distress shown by the protagonist (Aleksei Kravchenko) throughout the movie makes you cringe at every new scene. This movie in particular has such profound imagery that often times just a few seconds of frame at a particular image, (the back of the village) are enough to tell the entire story of both the people and the true nature of war itself. I felt that I was somehow being tormented throughout the movie, uneasy, moving around in my seat, in utter disbelief and disgust, realizing that the movie has almost direct parallels with actualities the war had. Klimov does an excellent job displaying the psychological effects of war on Floyra. The use of music excerpts fits perfectly with the movie. The moment the Nazis bomb the area Florya was first stationed we hear this deafening noise, we feel the emotions and feel like we are almost under attack ourselves.

345,8 February 2011,kristakibler,9, Florya becoming a true man in the eyes of World War II,"Elem Klimov's film, ""Come and See"" was an extraordinary realistic approach to the portrayal of the Soviet Union's struggle to survive during World War II. Klimov deserves all the recognition for creating one of the best honorable war movies of all time. Through his realistic stylistic attributes, the audience is able to fully indulge their six senses and develop a sensory overload that haunt your mind of the horrific events that will forever mark history. ""Are you crazy?!""-This is an amazing opening line of the film, that serves as an effective foreshadowing of what is to come. The intensity of ""Come and See"" is efficient through the use of reaction shots that allow viewers to feel for the actors as if they are in a trance. By shooting the actors at a ""through the lens"" glance, Kilmov is able to capture real humanistic expressions on their faces. Through these shots, the audience can unconditionally grasp an emotional awareness of what it could have been like to experience World War II for yourself. Also playing with your sense of smell, there is a scene in Florya's village where he returns only to find it has been completely wiped out by the Nazis. Florya and Glasha are sitting at the family table eating leftovers as flies infest the area. The elaborate buzzing of the flies leaves you cringing in your seat. The soundtrack and sound effects lead you through Florya's journey of survival while losing his home, family, hearing, and joining the Partisans. Through it all, he was able to redeem self-awareness and become a true man. Klimov's film is an intellectual montage. Consequently, the film is presented backwards putting focus on Florya's experience (the effect) first and then the dramatic closing scene of Florya shooting his rifle at a picture of Hitler (the cause). This way of montage allows you to fully focus on Floryas's ultimate challenge of finding a greater meaning and truth of life, without any glorifying aspects. In the beginning of this film, Florya is just a boy who dreams to become an honorable man. Through the film and through his experiences, does he actually come to terms with himself as a true soldier. In the end, you are now aware that Florya is a conscious man who isn't just fighting without cause. Now he is fully engaged and aware of Hitler's power and what it means to really fight in a traumatizing war.",
346,9 February 2011,samuraisahsah,7, less violence is more film,"Come and See was unlike any other ""war movie"" I've ever seen. There was no gratuitous and glory-filled banquets of violence dripping down the screen, in fact, considering this is a WWII film it's shocking that Klimov could create this film with such a minimalist approach and yet still have it be so powerful and shocking. Instead of just making your average war film stuffed with violence they fill this film with emotion, which one can clearly see in the lines etched into our protagonist's face by the end of the film. When a violent act is happening, like in the case of the barn being burned with the town's children inside, we don't even see what's happening. All we get is the view from the outside, which when taking into account the joyous time the Germans are having, has the atmosphere of a light hearted social occasion, a birthday perhaps. What makes the scene horribly all-too memorable is the shrieks and cries erupting from within, along with the urgent shaking and banging on the door one could only imagine would be the product of children being burned alive. Even when stacked up against the most gruesome of cinema's war scenes, for instance when the American troops rush the beaches of Normandy in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and blood is running in rivers down the beach, ""Come and See"" manages to leave a more deeply penetrating effect, really driving the message of humanity's potential for incomprehensible atrocity towards the darkest depths of our psyche. I couldn't forget those cries and small clenched fists banging on the wooden doors if i tried precisely because Klimov left what was going on behind those doors to the viewers imagination, something two dimensional images projected on a screen can never compete with.",

Klimov provides a sample of the horrors committed by the Nazis on Soviet civilians during their invasion; the dreadful experience of watching the film is fueled by Klimov's unsettling, but effective, mise en scene shaped by a Soviet approach to film making. Indeed, in order to reproduce historical events in a realist manner, Klimov has used unorthodox, but highly efficient methods, such as shooting animals or hypnotizing the main actor. The heritage of Soviet cinematographic philosophy is also present in a scene in which an ominous bird walks around the two young characters before the arrival of the Nazis; previous Soviet filmmaker such as Eisenstein understood that metaphorical images –such as a dreadful bird or the accidental crush of eggs –had as much impact on the audience as details advancing the plot.

This thought-provoking film presents us with brutal and vivid images that take us into the violent reality of war. The viewer can nothing but witness a young man's experience in a world of destruction and despair, its loss of humanity in the face of the horror and trauma of war. ""Come and see"" is a mind-blowing visual, but most importantly, emotional experience, a play on human psychology that redefines what one accepts as believable. It gives us insight on the absurdity of war: the ingenuity that one can put in destruction, the pleasure that one can take in imposing suffering, the dehumanization of a fellow human being along with the trivialization of death. The brutality of these images pushes us to question ourselves: how could one possibly believe that this quest for power, war, is worth the relinquishment of our humanity? How can one possibly justify the atrocities of war? And how can we today, everyday, go on with our lives ignoring on-going similar atrocities?",

This was an unpleasant viewing even beyond the brutal treatment of the innocent. The plot was unclear. Even if the plot was to just follow a slice of time with the young boy.

Even close-up shots, of some of the characters' faces, make me feel on edge, and even intimidated. What was going through my mind, while watching the film, was the depiction of war, and how others interpret it. Is war defined as bravery and courage, or suffering and insanity?

While we also get the perspective of the civilians within this war, and the grueling events that they are destined to face, the audience quickly receives the reverse montage that is shown to give a strong connection. Throughout the young boy's journey, he remains wondering why he wants to be part of a resistance, only to quickly grow up and develop his fast understanding of this war and how it is not about hate, killing, or victory but something more. The incredible sound effects and amazing camera positioning, really gives us the full dramatic feel that is going on, this keeps us at the edge of our seat to eagerly want to know if this young boy will make it past this torn world. At the end of the movie, we are following the resistance, then the camera turns to another path, leading the screen to show the development of snow on the trail, which possibly demonstrates the state of a Russian winter that has given victory to Russian territory in past wars. Thus giving the audience a sense of hope for this resistance, and how they will possibly prevail and preserve their homeland front.

356,10 February 2012,tsingiser-michael,10, The Power of War,"Come and See is one of the most harrowing films I have ever seen. The director, Elem Klimov, never loosens his grip on the audience throughout the entire film and he has us in his grasp. There are no exits for the film's characters, and Klimov forces that idea through the viewer as well. The mood that the film creates is such that even when nothing is occurring, we are still on the edge of our seat, fighting to keep our eyes glued to the screen. We are in war, just as Florya is. We are witnessing the atrocities that around, just as Florya is. We are no longer just sitting and viewing these events. Rather,we are transported into the Byelorussian countryside as the Nazis are invading. It is also of note that what is happening here in Byelorussia had also occurred in other parts of the country as well. This is an experience that I believe many viewers will have a hard time fully embracing, but those few that do will be forever changed. No other film has ever been able to so successfully convey the tone of war that Klimov's Come and See does. From the battered and stunning visuals to the isolated sound effects, this is as real as war can get on a movie screen. Though the film isn't necessarily entertaining, it is shocking, and if you are able to handle the horrifying aspects of war that Klimov is presenting, simply turning the film off becomes an impossibility. After viewing ""Come and See"", it is as one professor once said: ""It is a film that you will never forget"".",
357,10 February 2012,crojasav2011,9, Come and See,"""Come and See"" is a beautiful film by Elim Klimov, and a smart masterpiece way to pay tribute to the 40th anniversary Russian win over Germany forces. The cinematography of the movie made me react as in to how many people were hurt during the making of the film, but also during the actual war during War World II. It is brilliant to see how Floyra changes in front of the audience, first his innocence, and then his mind. The film does a well job in depicting how brutal war is, and Floyra's decision to stay in war at the end, even though he knows how brutal it is. In addition, by Klimov emphasizing on the story of this little village, the micros coping aspect makes the impact of the film bigger because it can represent any other village that was going under the same circumstances in Russia. The images of the film are devastating, and there is so much to absorb every second of the film.",

I know this movie will be imprinted into my mind forever. By engaging all my five senses, I really felt what was happening in the movie. I also mentally prepared myself being warned beforehand that I would see and feel unpleasant things. I saw a totally un-glamorized version of war, which I have never seen before. It makes me proud and thankful for the people in the army for their bravery. Innocent people were being gruesomely killed left and right. I felt as though I was right beside Florya as all these horrible things have been happening. When it said that this was happening to 628 other villages in Russia, it pained me even more that this horrible specific event was happening to villages all around as well. In the midst of all this sadness, Florya and Glashas friendship was delightful to see. They stuck by each other's side and even at the end of the movie when they were separated, Florya thought of his love for Glasha when he saw the raped girl. I wondered how people, like the Nazis could kill people so heartlessly but unfortunately people are killed to this day. People must see this film because it is sure to change your life and make you think.",

One such part in the film was when Florya and Glasha were running away from the village and then the camera shows all of the bodies piled behind the house. At that moment I almost felt as if I were Florya and I had just realized that my entire family, and village, had been massacred.",

Despite the fact Flyora is a fictional character, he and his fellow citizens represent the people who suffered the atrocities commited by their own species.

The use of music in cohesion with the film, really helped accentuate the scenes. The scores were beautiful, I especially enjoyed the piece from Mozart's Requiem. The way Klimov was able to show Florya's emotional aging was heartbreaking. I think it is because you experience Folrya's trauma as he experiences it, that makes his psychological aging so profound. Also, I really felt as if a lot of my senses were in use. Especially the scene where they dredge through the swamp, I could practically feel the mud and water surrounding me. I think Klimov does an excellent job in showing the impacts of war and the human condition. The movie was truly a haunting experience that I will not soon forget.",

It seemed that the director Klimov did everyhtin he could to depict war the horror of war. In opening scenes of the film I noticed how proud the main character Flor was about finding a gun and joining the rebel army. When the soldiers come and take Flor away from his mother it is evident that he has been sold an sensationalized view of war. He is proud to serve and fight in the war. At the camp Flor begins to see that war is not what he really thought. When he is forced to clean the camp and give up his boots Flor begins to git a hint that war is a rough rigid life full of necessity and not wants. When the army leaves Flor behind to watch after the camp he realizes that war is not so glorious. When Flor is having a good time and the mortars begin to fall out of the sky with the ground blowing up all around him flor is suddenly introduced into the psychological horrors of war. He soon realizes that war is hell on earth and not fun. The scene that most illustrates this is the scene where the nazi's round up all the towns people in a village , force them into a warehouse and burn them alive. This scene for me summarizes what the message of the movie. That war is hell and that maybe we should as adults should reassess the way we sell war , combat and violence as to younger children. It made me realize that as humans we are not wired for the psychological terror and trauma for war. This was one of the most emotionally disturbing movies that I have seen in my life. As previously mentioned the scene were the Nazis round up all of the women, children, elders and towns people. What disturbed me was how easy it was for the Nazis to burn tortue and kill those people in the village. It made me feel upset that human beings could become so barbaric and inhumane, I soon found myself calling the nazi's bastards wanting to jump out of my seat and throw something at the screen. My anger was a credit to Klimov's brilliant film making that make you feel like your were experience the real think, that I was there in the war. Lastly the main thing that I got from this movie was how dehumanizing war could be. It shocked me to see that Flor would rather use a bandage to repair his rifle than to help save a ding person. This allowed me to see how people over become dehumanized like the nazi's who killed all the villagers",

367,28 July 2012,mbanooni24,8, Great War Movie,"This movie was a really good movie about war. I enjoyed the realistic point of view made by Klimov throughout. There were many points throughout the movie that I greatly enjoyed. One was where the two main characters are crossing a very thick swamp filled with mud. This scene was very realistic (because the actors actually did this while they were being filmed) and it spoke a lot about how desperate times call for desperate measures. Just prior to this, when they were running to the swamp, there was a quick shot of a lot of dead bodies in Florya's neighborhood. This shows how cruel times of war are and even though the shot was very short, the impact was immense. The ending of this movie was very interesting to me as well. When Florya started shooting the picture of Hitler and having flashbacks on certain things throughout the history of Germany, I was surprised that the montage was going backwards instead of forwards. Also, it was a very deep scene because it showed the hatred towards Hitler and it showed that the whole reason why they were in that position was because of Hitler. I thought that when Florya joined the army again after shooting the picture proved the brotherhood of the army and how once you're sucked in, it's difficult to leave. After that, the ending was amazing to be. The shot of the snow in the middle of the forest with the very powerful music in the background made it even more important than any normal ending. The snow represented the downfall of Germany, because the winters are what got the Russians the victory over Germany and the music just added a lot of mood to that scene. I would definitely recommend this movie to many people, especially those who like war movies and those who want to go to war to see what it actually is like.",

Movies like Saving Private Ryan show the true experiences of the men who fought and died, The Thin Red Line illustrates the impact of war on nature, and Schindlers List shows us how one man can impact the lives of thousands in a positive manor, even in a time as hopeless as WWII. But this movie. This movie shows, in its utter, naked, complete monstrosity, the most barbaric acts we as humans are capable of. In some ways, it truly makes you ashamed to be human. It is the most horrific, terrifying, raw, hallowing movie ever produced. Come and see is a movie like no other I have ever seen, or for my sake, hopefully ever see again.",

This is one of the first war movies that I have personally viewed that did not include the normal glorification of war. It did not have a real ""Hero"", although I would say that the child that this movie follows is a real hero going through the trials and tribulations throughout this movie. I was blown away by the acting in this film. The child stars shine brightly through this dim and gloomy film. I walked out after seeing this movie rethinking the lives of all those affected by war. This gave me such a new appreciation for the struggles for families involved in combat. I was filled with sadness and confusion on how some of the people in this world can view another human being as nothing more than a pawn in a chess game. I feel that this movie has opened my eyes to things I would have never thought about before. Definitely recommended but prepare to be shocked and saddened by this one.",

After witnessing mass murder by the hands of the Germany Army, Florya, is compelled to be a defending solider (first), rather than a preteen, or a man. After watching this movie, i tried to place myself in Florya's position. I could not. It's far too easy to look at someone else situation or circumstance and say what you would have or could have done in retrospect. The truth is, you cannot say how you would responded. Psychologically, Florya was far more advanced then my present thought process in trying to rationalize or justify what i would have done.

While watching the film it reminded me of how unfortunately similar situations happen in today's society and the results are deaths of innocents. The wars and violence that exist in countries only causes more deaths and hatred especially for the innocents of children.

Floya though is a child, making the film a rite of passage as much as it is a war film. If this film can truly be called such, as it lacks any of the conventions and cliques of any Hollywood war film. In it there is no sense of war being in way heroic or noble.

Klimov did a fantastic job on letting us the viewers experience almost the same exact senses and feelings the protagonist experienced in the film. I felt as if I was actually living at the same time and place that the film was taking place and it frightened me a bit that I had also believed I was right next to Florya hearing, smelling, and feeling what he did.

377,26 July 2012,lexismilisic,9, Aleksey's performance,"I was deeply affected by Aleksey Kravchenko's (Florya) performance in Elem Klimoc's film ""Come and See"". From the beginning of the story, we see an innocent boy, somewhat emotionally foreign from the direct contact of savages and war. His naive eyes sparkle and show interest toward the idea of war, yet he has no idea as to the trouble that is about to drop dead before him. As he is introduced to the turmoil that his country and people are going through, his innocence diminishes and with him we begin to experience Florya's journey into adulthood. Throughout the movie, Florya detachment from his youth is heartbreaking; he is immediately thrown into the cruel world of men and machinery. The character Florya, along with Klimoc's stylistic approaches, drew me in and made me feel emotionally involved from beginning to end. This is one of the most powerful war films I have ever seen.",
378,11 February 2012,barber_brittany_rae,10, Comments,"There are scenes in ""Come and See"" that I will never forget, and since first seeing the film, have not stopped thinking about. As the title suggests, we are subject to an insider view of what happened in just one of 628 Belorussian villages who were invaded by Nazi soldiers. This film feels real, and is so powerful because of the excellence in which it was made, but also for it's capturing a historical truth; this is not just a movie. The shot where Florya—already mentally damaged from the overwhelming horror of his surroundings—looks at a young girl, bloody from a sordid rape is one of many images that represent the scars of the nation as a whole. Florya physically and psychologically ages, and we see the raw nature of who he has understandably become. What he has experienced is relentlessly worn on his face. The incredible authenticity and stylized sound design adds to the intensity. A really significant element that I've never experienced fully from a film is how all five senses are involved, especially how tactilely is evoked.",

It is not a movie such as I've ever seen and I cannot say that I enjoyed it, but non the less it is a film that should be watched for anyone interested in what man is capable of. It should be seen so as to know why we must control ourselves to be as morally aware as possible and to try to get along with each other so as not to repeat the same patterns of history again and again.  The film is very interesting in the way it was made, it is so unconventional that it is hard to relate to it.  It actually gave me the feeling that I was a witness to an event that was absolutely intolerable and despicable.  Watching this film was like being there yet your mind cannot take the pain and torture so it becomes a dreamy nightmare that one cannot escape from until wakened by the live reversing footage of Hitler's Europe imploding at the end of the film.

389,7 June 2010,Brittan09,10, My thoughts about the film:,"This film is one of my favorite films I have ever seen because it has left a lasting impression on me. While I don't particularly enjoy war movies, finding the violence often to intense to find anything worth fill in watching it, this movie was different because it was not centered around the actual physical brutality of war, but the mental impact it has on the soldiers. In most war movies I have seen the typical soldier is portrayed as a desensitized character who does not seem to be effected by the murdering and the cruelty of war, which is very unrealistic and a unhealthy message to send to society. What is particularity nice to see in this film are the steps the Flior goes threw to become dehumanized, which is more true to reality in my opinion. Kilmov does an excellent job at making the viewer not only see but also experience the realities of war and the anguish it leaves our soldiers in. In many scenes of the film the viewer experiences the events with Flior through their own senses. For example, when Flior crawls threw the mud pond I felt like I was there with him smelling the mud and it made me actually cringe. Also, the scene when the cow is shot and we watch it die I felt a sense of loneliness and it pained me to watch it. However, this could have been attributed to the fact that I am not accustomed to watching the actual murder of animals, as their deaths are usually faked. At first I thought this movie was an anti-war film, however, the more I reflect I believe that in this case the movie tells us that the war was completely necessary and sought to reveal the courage the people of the Soviet army revealed under such grotesque circumstances.",

Focusing on the tale and travail of an adolescent thrust into the cauldron of the world around him the film conveys in crude, ugly and grimy scenes the filth and misery war thrust on the Russian peasant class. With minimal battle scenes the movie instead portrays in tunnel vision the narrow world view of individuals and their place in a momentous era in world history. The filmmakers fail in almost every way to do justice to what could have been a gripping tale by flopping in pacing, music, cinematography, etc.; the inability to convey what they simply set out to do. The scene where atrocities occur is too flat and erratic to successfully show the nightmare of such and the film's attempt at a flashback is childish and amateurish enough to elicit pity and disbelief. While the acting is good and there are moments where the hell of war howls through they're far too few to make it work in this loooooooooooong and tedious work.

Living in a simple and quaint village, he has a good life but is restless and itching to get out of an unadventurous environment. Naïve but full of vigor, he joins the army in the hopes of joining a camaraderie. What he finds instead, is more than he bargained for.

397,14 November 2015,maria_isabee,8, Come and See,"The 1985 Soviet war film entitled ""Come and See,"" directed by Elem Klimov revolving around the Nazi German occupation of the Byelorussian SSR. As watching this film Andrei Tarkovsky's ""Ivan's Childhood"" came to mind. Although the two are quite similar as both depict a child in war they couldn't be far different in delivery. Klimov's film doesn't center around the psychologically events war has on children as much as Ivan's Childhood does. We have far more aspects of war that are being shown such as the separation of families, the portrayal of manslaughter, we even see the German's celebrating after essentially burning an entire village. Klimov takes an entirely new portrayal of soviet war films that is both haunting and shocking. Klimov's usage of cinematic tools that makes viewers feel like they themselves are experiencing the same volatile environment that Florya is confronted with which makes this film all the more difficult to watch. There is one particular scene that is almost a mirror image of a scene in Ivan's Childhood where Florya is looking over a well while searching for his family just as what Ivan does. The image of Florya that is reflected in this scene doesn't appear as that of a child in fact this scene is most likely the beginning of when we begin to see Florya start to age rapidly as hinted with the absence of hair that is shown in his reflection. You see Florya as someone who is actively trying to avoid the horrible truth; we see this clearly when Florya is always covering his ears. The contrast in characters between Glasha who sees death everywhere and Florya who avoids this is also portrayed in the scene were Florya refuses to believe that his family was killed and rushes to a nearby island in search for them not taking notice of the mass number of dead bodies behind his house. The scene were the bog that Glasha and Florya are trying to cross is noticeable dense but the drastic change in consistency that happens a few minutes later most likely serves as Florya's difficulty in accepting the reality-coming to terms that his family was killed. The conclusion of the film where Florya comes upon the portrait of Hitler is an impactful moment where Florya seeks to undo all the terrific horror events that all of Europe has suffered at the hands of Hitler. Every shot attempts to erase Hitler's existence.",

399,31 October 2018,netmedic-12333,4, Why is everyone raving about this?,"If you want an ""arty"" war film, then I suppose this is for you.
I think the director only partially succeeded in portraying the suffering of civilians during times of war, due to making some silly mistakes with the planning and execution of certain scenes.
Some parts stretched credulity beyond breaking point. For example, the protagonist being allowed to splash around for ages in the bog before his girlfriend eventually decided to tell him that it was futile because she knew his family were dead.
The recurring motif of the airplane, so badly executed that it was akin to a flying saucer from a 1950's sci-fi ""B"" movie.
The Germans, who, to a man, were completely ecstatic about burning a barn full of Belarusians. You might have thought that one or two of them would be human enough to turn away or find something else to do other than applaud.
The very poorly applied makeup on the protagonist's face which was supposed to convey his dramatic aging due to his experiences.
The stupidity of running into the middle of an enormous field when supposedly trying to sneak past German lines to get food.
The stork. Very arty but incomprehensible.
All these issues pull down what could have been a great film.
I think the best part was the unexpected ""bomb"" from the airplane. Human moment.
Some other parts were well done. The sacking of the villages was portrayed well, possibly due to a complete lack of planning the scenes and winging it.
Use of animals worked well, must have been excellent handlers (apart from the stork).
The acting was very very good. Characters developed well, just some fibre, maybe some documentary styling missing to make the thing more believable.
Watchable, interesting, different, but by no means a ""masterpiece"" or ""great"".",

I found myself pacing back and forth because I felt so consumed and emotionally overwhelmed by the film that I had to keep my legs moving to remind myself which world I was in. This film is (pardon my Russian) a motha****** masterpiece. It was incredibly difficult to watch, the subject matter deals with one of the most horrific manifestations in human life: war. Every element from the cinematography to the sound design (most incredible sound design I've ever heard by the way), pulls you in further and further. And I don't mean catches your attention, I mean pulls you in to the point of physically experiencing nausea from the emotional weight the film carries. And that's not nausea from gruesome scenes either... It is nausea from the realization that we as humans are capable of creating hell on earth.....and watching this unfold is unsettling to say the least. But don't let this deter you, just because this film was a work out to watch, I feel infinitely wiser and more connected to the human race than I ever have. Please watch it, you won't regret it.

When I was a child Belarus was still in USSR and they used to show many war films on TV. I saw this movie also, but I didn't really like it. There was not much of war for me at that time, lack of skirmish. Ironically, at those times it was not the best movie to show to soviet people. The screen play was written by Ales Adamovich, belarusan writer, who didn't stand a high esteem of soviet government. Some scenes in this movie tell about things which were forbidden by soviet propaganda machine (that actually ukrainians collaborators, not (only) germans burned the people, how partisans were ""heating up"" - acting in in police uniforme, things about belarusan collaboration, about ""samaachova"" etc). The WW2 in USSR was something holy, and only one version of it existed, the government one.",
407,13 March 2002,s_gangas,10, The definitive anti-war film!,"Theodor Adorno in an instructive essay titled ""Education After Auschwitz"", claims that all education should be geared towards identifying and understanding the social causes that led to the immense catastrophe of WWII. In other words, through critical theory he wishes to negate in a determinate way the Holocaust in order to both avoide a similar event in the future, but also to create the conditions for the emancipation of humanity from barbarism. Elem Klimov's film points to this direction. The Nazis are portrayed as total beasts for the reason that these collective atrocities transcend individual character. Cyclical camera - movement creates appropriate disorienting effects that match the inferno of war, while hand-held camera gives this horrific experience an immediacy that most films lack. Klimov celebrates in a lyrical way the power of nature and innocence in contrast to the Nero-like scortching of the Byelorussian village. The dialectic between terror and visual splendoour in not resolved in favour of the latter. Rather, Klimov uses superb visuals in order to emphasize the political dimension of the film without resorting into a sterile aestheticization of war and violence, a vice that permeates most Hollywood productions. Overtly influenced by Bergman's ""The Shame"", ""Come and See"" keeps the memory of these atrocities alive; that in itself is the most noble political function that great art can offer!",

409,11 December 2011,Laetitiaa,9, Extra credit,"This is an incredible film by Elem Kilmov, that takes us inside the truth incident of the world war 2 through a young boys eyes. It is not often I get affected by movies but this is certainly a movie that affected me and opened my eyes. It made me disgusted by the humanity. How can people be such savages towards each other especially towards innocent children, women and old people to lock them inside houses and burn them. I feel a huge sympathy for those people who were killed during this war. I think by doing this movie he expressed his opinions and emotions about the world war 2 through a young boy, because he was a kid when the world war 2 erupted. I believe that this movie shows the truth side of the war. I love the way the movie is filmed, because it makes you feel like you are a part of the movie. Like you are experiencing the incidents that the characters are going through. The camera movement and the iconic picture is so well done and intensive. The close up of the character catches the intensive emotion. The sound effect on the deaf boy makes you go inside his brain.You can feel the pain and confusion he is going through, like he is losing his mind. Even if this movie represent sorrow and cruelty I could still see some moments of joy. One scene in particular is when the character Glasha dances after the Germans bombarded their camp. It was a way for them to show that they are still alive. I think the message of the film has a good connection to the title. The title says it all, come and see how they German soldiers treated us, locked innocent and hopeless unequipped Soviet resistance in their house and burned them. The camera really takes you inside the cruelty of the world war 2. The cast of the film is incredibly talented. The music of Mozart that was used in this movie, lifts the film and gives it a powerful and beautiful sound. The soundtrack and sound is designed in a way to put us through a war so we can feel what the population during the war felt like. You can also through the music hear all elements of sorrow, horror, fear, darkness, despair and in a way happiness all at the same time. Do you think war is cool? Shooting and killing some enemies? Watch this film and then ask yourself the same question. I guarantee you that it will change your view of all the violence. It is an incredibly touching and great movie.",

Klimov didn't take out the sensitive details, he wasn't scared that the audience will leave the theater. He wanted to let us know and show in his movie that those people went through during that war period, how they screamed when they were burning, and how their murders took pictures front of the burning houses. Besides those war movies which shows the big cities this movie is concentrates to the small villages, because there wasn't any other movie that would do the same. Perfectly shows that the age doesn't matter in war. You have to fight other wise you are going to die. I really like the idea how the director showed to the audience how much the war can change people, through the protagonist boy, Florja. Not just his personality changed and his thinking about the war but also his look, which is well done by the make up artist. At the end a 20 years older face look us back.

Not only are you granted A front row seat to some of the more horrific and beautiful images film has to offer (thanks to mostly hand-held camera work), you can almost smell the toxic fumes emanating from the swamp as Florya desperately plods through it. The soundtrack meshes perfectly with the mood of the film and only heighten the experience. This film is taxing both emotionally and psychologically. By the end of the film our young and naive star has aged what looks to be about 30 years or more. Does this represent him growing into a man?

This one of those films that really brings past horrors to life. The director's imagery is sensational and the on location filming as done with perfection. I get the feeling that the director does not really care if we focus on the plot, as much as the overall tone and themes he presents.

The movie takes place through the eyes of a 13-year-old boy named Florya, who joins the partisans to fight with Russian partisans in Belarus, when the Nazis torched over 600 villages and slaughtered their people in 1943. Come and See is one of the best war movies I have ever seen. It does prove that a great war movie doesn't necessarily need to have over the top special effects or production budget. A very powerful movie that makes you feel and sense what goes on in wars. It does touch on the reality of what war brings into people's lives and its affects on their behavior and decision makings.

417,13 December 2011,mrethanfalk,7, A Traumatizing Epic,"""Come and See"" was a film in which I really had trouble watching and enjoying. It goes without saying though that Elem Klimov deserves to be praised for his brilliant film-making. He was really able to effectively encapsulate this tragic event through the use of disturbing sounds and horrifying visuals, though it's a movie that would pain me to sit through again. It's one thing to remember and reflect on brutal, historical events, but to be involved in them first hand(which is what the movie essentially does to you), is truly overwhelming for the psyche. A film like ""Schindler's List,"" on the other hand, is something I can sit through several times without feeling as 'mentally abused.' I recognize that this was exactly what Klimov wanted to evoke in me. His intentions were geared towards having me take part in this war alongside the films protagonist Florya.

And in the moments where you tell yourself that this is just a movie, in an attempt to make yourself feel more comfortable about what you are seeing, Klimov has a way of reminding you that this is real.

Throughout the film, he stares at the camera inviting you to keep watching; an invitation that everyone takes but doesn't like. Personally, I felt very disturbed by all of the events that the young boy goes through. His face is one that is not easily forgotten. His lips are dry, his eyes look dead.

Throughout the movie we follow Flyora who is exposed to the brutality of war, however it seems like he becomes numb to it and at the end only wishes to survive this hell. The movie has an incredibly intense effect on the viewer and leaves the audience in a shocked state of mind. Although it depicts World War 2 and the cruelty it brought out of humankind, our generation does not seem to put much effort into creating a present that will be a better history for the future.

The plot is good - it feels like it's following the kid through a one-day journey, though the scenes/times change at several point.

This film sent me through and emotional roller coaster the whole time I was watching it, and made me question whether I would be able to go through these same situations and still have the will to live. For me, this film border lines a horror film, mainly because it is very haunting and scary. The scene where the Nazis are torching the homes with the people inside were particularly scary to me because I have a huge fear of fire. But at the same time, it could have been just as scary to come out of the house because the torture could have been just as bad or worse. It was moments like these that made me think about war, its purpose and the sacrifices or decisions that people who are in it make. Although this film is meant to be realistic, it can become hard to continue watching. There are no moments of hope or happiness, and watching Flyora age so quickly through out the movie is very disturbing.

432,4 June 2012,a_Fuhri,8, Confrontational war movie.,"Come and See is a very impressive film that almost literally leaves you shaking after the camera tilts up to the sky in the final shot. It proves that war movies can only be made effectively when they are not visually and narratively sugar coated. For one, because this is cinematically more interesting and relevant, but more importantly because it does more justice to the people that underwent the atrocities of that particular war. ""Come and see"" is a tribute to the people in the former Soviet Union that were affected by Nazi atrocities. A tribute to those who died and to the survivors of the Nazi invasion. Visually it is a raw movie, allowing us to see what this war and war in general is like. It warns us how people can follow evil blindly and become dehumanized killing machines. And by showing this in every ugly detail we actually come as close as possible to knowing what went on in this Belarusian village. It does justice to those that died and suffered. Just as ""Schindler's List"" pays tribute to the six million Jews that were killed by the Nazis. Just as ""The Deer Hunter"" did justice to the soldiers that came back from Vietnam with post traumatic stress disorder. The point is that these movies were dramatic, but not melodramatic in its depiction of the premise to allow the viewer as accurate a depiction of the events that took place as is possible. ""Come and See"" is a very powerful movie that depicts the resiliency of a lesser equipped Partisan force that beat the Nazis. It also shows us that war can make numb, but that numb doesn't mean dehumanized. This shows in how Flyora shoots at the the portrait of Hitler in the montage sequence, but finally cannot pull the trigger when his thoughts portray Hitler as a baby. Klimov's message is that Flyora becomes the same as the Nazis if he'd shoot the baby picture, just like the general is saying in the scene before when he decides that the Nazis shouldn't be burned. They would stoop down to the animalistic level of the Nazis that we saw in the barn scene. Flyora joins the Partisans as a boy that is hardened by life, but still a human thinker fighting for a just cause. ""Come And See"" is a must see movie both for the messages that it conveys to us, but also because it is a very well crafted movie by a smart director.",

The film depicted WWII as if it were a documentary following Russian resistance but with beautiful cinematography and direction. Emotionally the film left me stunned to the point of apathy when I finished watching it. It was a two and half hour visual and auditory assault to my eyes and ears. Despite its brutal honest depiction of the war I enjoyed the fact that this film was able to invoke this kind of emotional response on me, which I feel is very rare in films today. I also loved Flyoras transformation from a ignorant eager child into a scarred soul with the will to still keep on fighting for he's people, even after all the horror he experienced throughout the film.

It is crazy to think that real war images don't create a reaction anymore in human beings minds; we have become numb to everything that doesn't directly affect us, our family or friends. This certainly does not apply for everyone, but the evidence is that as a species, we don't end the suffering once and for all. Like it's not enough what happened up until today. One might think that evolution and a larger brain should have given us the tools to become peaceful and more understanding. It has on the contrary, given us enough intelligence to build larger and more horrific bombs that could probably kill most of us and all the other living things on this planet. It's a shame that this film was unknown to me until most recently, and to one of my dearest thoughts that it evoked– is it possible for a film to actually make a major difference globally? I mean – if a war can't, could a film do just that? I believe that everyone that watches this movie will not only think once, but five times about what war is really about, and what it does.

For me, it's a great film if you want to know more about the Nazi invasion, and maybe get a taste of what war is like. But I am not much for war films, I understand the importance of not forgetting what happened in the past, and the fact that there are situations like this still going on, and the annihilation of villages and it's people still happening to this day. I appreciate the film, and think everyone should watch it, but definitely be aware of it's intensity as it may be too much, as it was for me.",
441,2 June 2012,dillon-ross,8, Frightful Images-Impossible to Look Away,"This movie was one of the most realistic movies I've ever seen. For a movie in a completely different language then English it was amazing how in touch I felt with each of the characters. It is a emotional roller coaster, I would advise watching this film with no references or pre knowledge of the plot. I watched it not knowing what to expect and I feel it affected me the most this way. I also don't want to write about the plot much because like I said I want you to have a clean slate once viewing. But even with such horrible images the pictures shot are also so beautiful. From a technical standpoint this movie is a masterpiece. I think what shocked me the most was how real everything was and how it was shot in almost a perspective view to make it feel as if I was there. Once my mind was connected with the film to make it seem as reality the story and plot hit me so much harder and by the end of the movie all i could really say to explain how i felt was numb.",
442,3 June 2012,MikeCourtney310,9, A gloomy path to realization,"Very few films have left me feeling the impact days after the viewing. This is definitely one of them. The opening scenes of the boys searching in the deserted sand bank were very intriguing as it turns out to the viewer that they were searching for buried rifles from previous war times. The shock factor of this film is extremely high. If you are not okay with brutal violence in cinema, this is definitely not a film for you. While watching ""Come and See"" I felt a strong looming necrotic feeling increase as the film progressed. Once Florya and Glasha escape the forest bombings and retreat to a formerly familiar place that was once Florya's home, my gut was wrenched. The sounds of the buzzing flies among utter silence queues the unwelcome presence of death, which we do not see until they leave and Glasha glances behind a barn to see the villagers now as a pile of gruesome corpses. The moment when she notices but does not tell Florya made my head spin at the thought of family ties being severed forever in such a brutal and unfair manner. The sheer realistic manner of the film is enough to engulf viewers into feeling for Florya and his people as their existence is nearly decimated by the unrelenting hand of Nazi Germany. Once the film wound to an end I found myself reflecting on all the horrific imagery and pain that Florya witnessed on his resilient path to surviving such a brutal inhumane event. I couldn't help but feel the hatred he felt and yet I understood why he wanted to join the ranks and fight the good fight once he realized that war is no game. I feel that the pride and resilience Russians carried on their back during the Nazi atrocities is strong enough to charge a fight for in any human witnessing this breathtaking twister of a film.",

Sadness, confusion, anger...it may have brought a few smiles, but physically it made me sick. (I had to walk out of the room when I felt I was running out of air) Florya's scared look as he saw his people being burned in that barn just made my head hurt.

This film is a psychological horror drama that evokes the person inside us who wants to fight against evil. It offers a different view point of war in general, of how brutal it can be.

455,31 July 2010,yenypalacios,10, Assalt on the senses,"Before seeing the movie, the Film Studies professor told the students: ""It is an assault on the senses"", but nothing could have prepared me to deal with mixed feelings that the film produced. Floyra, the child that the story revolves, ages just in front of the viewer's eyes. He ages based on the most frightening experiences one can imagine. The responsible for the terrible injuries in soul and body are other human beings for the ones that not descriptions exist. I could use the word beast to describe them, but animals do not act like they do. The Nazi soldiers attack Floyra's village, subdue, torture and murder its inhabitants. Entire families are burned alive and soldiers rejoice in their work. Most of the perpetrators are drunk. This can be considered a sign of humanity that can speak of the desire to numb and even block the conscience to commit such barbarism. Nature embodies degradation as well. What was green and lush is transformed, by the grace of the German bombs, in bleak remains of trunks and bare branches, a metaphor for the condition of this young soul. The bomb that deafens to Floyra echoes in the audience. The buzz is part of the assault to the senses about professor spoke before the film opened. It is particularly disturbing the scene about cow that is stolen by Floyra and his comrades not to eat, but to provide milk to the hungry people who remain hidden in the outskirts of the village. An initial burst of bullets kills his comrades and the second wounds and kills the animal. Its eyes show the agony and it is impossible to look, you must close your eyes to avoid those feelings. Exhausted, Florya falls asleep under the heat of the dying animal and wakes up with the coldness of death only to rise up and think how to drag the animal to where his people are, but it is impossible. The viewer lives Floyra's experiences. Stress is not just emotional, the body is stiff and there is nothing to mitigate the feeling until the end of the film, even when those who commanded the massacre were captured by the guerrillas and are subjected to a sort of trial that ends with a benign death sentence. Instead of burning them alive, as it was the first intention, they are put to death with bullets. Floyra's revenge is different; he shoots Hitler's photograph and as clear demonstration of the resilience of the human being, he picks up his rifle and joined his comrades. He is not longer the rookie in search of adventure. Now he is a man readily participating in this awful cycle. I like this movie. I highly recommend it. Director Elem Klimov shows us a harsh vision of war and, it's a very persuasive message against any confrontation.",

Come and See contains no enjoyment or relief for any of the characters until the final few minutes where by shooting a picture of Hitler we see footage of the war in reverse and get to briefly fantasize that none of it ever happened.

I think it fits into a category of film which best summed up, would be the 'Film of one's Duty', works of a historical or wartime nature that deserve remembrance or realisation of events and atrocities of our past. Come and See is a difficult one to categorise as despite its overall impact and significance, try telling yourself after its over that it provided you with an entertaining experience. Its not that sort of film, as you recline back in the safety, security and comfort of your individual surroundings.I'm glad I finally caught up with it and knowing full well I wouldn't be supplied with a feel good film, I still can commend it for its sheer technical bravado, the brave cast members and the satirical wasteland it entertained in the final reels.I think its important to see and admire these sort of artefacts for the express purpose that they really make you 'see' and 'feel' something.To shake you out of your complacency and take new stock of one's own station in life.It was a memorable but sombre trip well worth taking.",
460,28 October 2007,Dominic-Berlemann,10, Deeply disturbing tour de force into the abyss of the Nazi's war of annihilation in the Eastern theater,"Once you've seen this 1985 movie by Elem Klimov, you'll never be able to forget it. The reasons for this are to be seen both in the aesthetic quality of the realization of the script, to which Ales Adamovich contributed as well as the director, and in the extraordinary sujet, the brutal elimination of a Belorussian village and its inhabitants at the hands of the SS in 1943, something that happened to 628 villages in Belarus alone between 1941 and 1944. Partisan warfare behind the front-lines forms the background of this profoundly shocking and deeply moving drama. The pubescent protagonist of the movie, the 14 year-old Flyora, against the will of his mother stubbornly and somewhat naively insists to be allowed to join the ranks of the Soviet partisans operating from the relative security of the impenetrable woods in the area of his native village. The partisans, however, don't think young Flyora to be of much use, and therefore give him only minor tasks like standing on guard. At the partisan encampment he meets Glasha, a girl romantically linked with Kasatch, the leader of the partisan unit. In the course of the film, the almost extra-terrestrial beauty of the girl sharply contrasts with the ever-increasing brutalities of war. After an air raid on the partisan camp, Flyora and Glasha decide to make it for the boy's nearby home village. However, the villagers have all been executed, quite likely because despite all precautions it must have become known to the German occupiers that a boy from the village had joined the guerilla forces. Their bodies can be seen for the fraction of a second piled up like culled cattle behind a wooden house. Flyora feels guilty for what happened and heads back to his fellow partisans, leaving behind Glasha. Shortly after that, the boy tries to steal a cow from another village in order to support his unit, yet Flyora is spotted by the German troops that happen to be in the place at the same time. With difficulty, Flyora manages to escape and to disguise himself as an innocent farm-boy, but his actions trigger off an unimaginable act of revenge on the part of the SS men. The following part of the movie will definitely make some viewers TURN OFF their TVs, as it realistically depicts in great detail the slaughtering of the village people by sadistic and partly intoxicated SS troops going on about their deadly 'business' in what seems to be unscrupulous routine fashion, standard procedure. At the same time, the movie's aesthetic foundation undergoes a radical change: After the poetic, neo-expressionistic start to the movie which in many respects like its heavy symbolism is typical of 1970s and 1980s Soviet art cinema, the director switches to a purely naturalistic mode of presentation which lets the horrible facts speak for themselves. Those who manage to endure this part of the movie right to the end at least are rewarded with the almost cathartic arrest and subsequent execution of the SS unit's leaders and their Belorussian accomplices responsible for these horrific atrocities. At the end, it becomes clear that the experiences of the boy have deeply etched themselves into his soul and his face, which is disfigured by wrinkles making him look like an old man by the end of the movie. All in all, this is a true masterpiece which delineates the dreadful historical truth in an adequate artistic fashion bare of propagandistic tendencies.",

Now, this particular film is like a masterpiece that should be stored and saved for years and years for generations to see. This film steadily kept my attention from beginning to end (even though it wasn't in English). ""Witnessing"" Coming and See (and it's a film you are forced to witness from Klimov), serves as a painful reminder though that the reality of war is hell. In the case of Russia, a very cold hell. There is no innocence or sympathy for anyone. All soldiers are equal. In the movie I thought, ""but hes just a young boy!"" Without doubt Come and See is one of the most powerful film i have seen so far. Though this film is emotionally draining, there are so many scenes that are like turning the page of a storybook. At the end of the film, the protagonist makes another shift in character (in my opinion) during the regressive montage where he is shooting a picture of Hitler. When he gets to the baby picture and doesn't shoot it shows that the protagonist still has some shred of morality. As a solider you are given orders without question. The first character change was when his parents were killed. I believe the character ""snapped"" into reality and consequently losing his innocence and his mind.",

It is an experience and a unique approach to show a part of humanity affected by a horrible war, a war not only on the outside, but deep at the heart of human emotions. The lively and atypical sequence of the story rather than plot driven has touched me profoundly. The portrayal of suffering is very vivid because we see, we smell, we feel as if we were there. Florya finds himself in the middle of growing up and consequently the rapid worn out of his life caused by the horrors of the war. We see him age so quickly in front of our eyes and with the sound, it makes it more haunting. To lose your mind, to age so so fast is just unbelievable. The long take shots and the very realistic actions leaves us in awe. It is a trauma that in the end doesn't really have an ending, a film that could always have the same impact anywhere, anytime.",

Florya starts off as a boy playing in the sand looking for guns yet as the movie progresses he has to use the gun for more then just play. The aging of Florya can be seen on the boys face through out the movie and is made even more apparent with close up shots of Florya staring straight into the camera. The camera movements can be disconcerting but it only adds to the emotions running rampant within Florya. He seems to almost go crazy at points. This movie left me in a quite shock.

477,6 June 2010,sampen_ashley,10, Intense but gratifying movie with a message,"""Come and See"" is a very memorable movie for me. I can't help but picture the scenes that I'll never forget over and over again. It has so many elements that makes this movie as strong as it is. The message I got from this movie is the realities of war are not what is shown in ""Hollywood"" movies. This movie sheds the light on the truths of war so creatively that as a viewer, you can't help but feel like you are there with Florya, enduring all that he endures. Florya starts out so naive and innocent to the horrors of war, like most recruits of the military are. His face of sublime happiness when the soldiers come to take him to the camp set up in the woods is frightening. He only sees the glory and fame that war can offer while his mother, who is sobbing uncontrollably, knows what could happen to him as well as to her self and her twin daughters. This moment touched me because I have a little brother who will have to enlist soon but thankful he is not blind to the truth of war. I couldn't promise that I wouldn't sob like Florya's mother if my brother had to go war. Florya then meets Glasha, a beautiful woman who seems to be the lover or perhaps ex-lover of Koshach, the commander of the soldiers. Glasha is a pivotal character for Florya because she seems to represent all woman for Florya. Florya's humanity is also seen when he cares and builds a shelter for Glasha. Glasha eventually becomes all that Florya must protect because he loses his mother and twin sisters. The scene where the audience discovers the death of Florya's family is so heartbreaking and I found myself silently hoping and praying that maybe his mother and twin sisters are on that island in the middle of the bog. I knew deep down that there was no chance that they survived but I couldn't bring myself to abandon hope. This film definitely made me feel for the characters and that is what makes it so intense, at least for me. These characters could be people today. Glasha is a girl who wants to be loved but is rejected by the man she wants. Florya is a boy trying to prove he's a man by using combat. This film is very realistic and I think it is amazing that the director used actual bombs and gunfire for authenticity. ""Come and See"" does a great job of showing the audience what war is really like and I believe that is important because so many people are disillusioned by movies that glamorize war when the truth is there is no real victory in war. I like how this film starts Florya out in a sort of peaceful camp site where the soldiers of the partisan are gathered then the audience is thrusted into real warfare, shown by the used of real bombs dropped near the Florya and Glasha when an air attack begins. The scenes that were most brutal for me were the barn-burning scene, and the girl rape at the end. Even though the actress who played Glasha isn't the actress who played the girl who was raped at the end, I couldn't help but connect the two. although Glasha's fate is never revealed in the film, she probably ended up just like that girl at the end because she was pretty and couldn't fight back an army of Nazis by herself. In conclusion I definitely recommend this film but be forewarned that it's not exactly easy to watch.",
478,6 June 2010,hkeane-758-302260,10, Harvest your serotonin prior to watching this film.,"Even after I watched this film I continuously asked myself why ""Come and See"" was the chosen title for this powerful film from the Post Soviet Era. A harsh yet comedic depiction of communism, it was one of the films that came out of its tin can after censorship. It's no wonder that it premiered at the 1987 Moscow International Film Festival, one of 25 films shown for the first time from that era. I love how this movie tastes and smells and sounds and feels and truly moves you from your seat. In the dire moments of the film I caught myself almost swatting away the flies; Elem Klimov truly puts you in the shoes of various characters. The close attention to detail, utilizing all five of the audience's senses, made a tremendous impact in the outcome. It dug that knife so much deeper when we sat aghast and in horror at the fate of each character. The image of Hitler as a child that sunk into my thoughts and resonated into my mind; I remembered the comment an SS Officer had made about Russians and how the so-called unraveling began with the children. I immediately saw the correlation between the two, somewhat agreeing with what he was saying but in the completely opposite direction. To be as rotten as Hitler I truly believe that no amount of life suffering could have amounted to justify genocide. Everyone has troubles and lament in one way or another; Hitler is a perfect example of how bad seeds start as kids. What I had trouble recognizing was the immense disdain that previously discussed SS Officer had for communism. The thread that conversation had originally sparked from stemmed from the manipulation of asking the adults to leave all children in the barn, unknowingly to be burned to cinder. Only a monster would be able to do such a haunting and sinister act, thus why analyzing any SS Officer and Hitler himself would be as progressive as running in circles. I feel the most pivotal moment for Florya in the entire film, aside from shooting the picture of Hitler, was when he entered a reenactment of what he missed in his hometown into the second village. He was an outsider, a participant who outwardly glanced at the slaughter. It was almost as if the village was composed of sheep versus humans, constantly catering to the Germans every step of the way. It was in this moment Florya truly realized the grand scheme of the situation and that it was on a massive scale. Truly inspiring. I went from hating war post-""Come and See"" to making a beeline to the WW2 section in the library.",

480,7 June 2010,viytta1991,8, Unforgettable Film,"I have seen many, many war movies throughout my life time, but this film has got to be the one that will remain in my memory forever. As I was watching ""Come and See,"" I felt like a character in the movie. It was like I could smell the fires and explosions that were occurring non-stop throughout the film. This has got to be one of the most powerful movies ever made. It also is one of the most horrific coming of age movies ever. I imagine that individuals who are pro-war would also be very affected by this film. In the beginning Floyra, the protagonist in the film, starts off by trying to find a weapon which obviously shows his love and desire to be in war; however, towards the end of the film, after he has experiencing all the hardships that comes as a result, his desire to be in war is no longer evident. We, as an audience, end up having the same feeling as Floyra towards the end. The audience is rendered much like Floyra that we watch with pleasure as Floyra symbolically destroys a picture of Hitler. I like that Klimov's style of shooting in the movie allows for the actors to look directly at the camera, as if the viewers are part of the movie. Klimov does an amazing job of showing us the story through the eyes of the characters. I was astonished by the acting in this film. I have never seen such marvelous acting. This helped drive the film forward. Although this movie may be brutal and too much content for some viewers, i still recommend seeing it. The brutality is there to show us what war is truly like. This movie must be watched. It is a masterpiece.",
481,7 June 2010,disc00,10, potential insomnia,"If you get scared easily, do not watch this film alone at night. Especially if you plan on getting a relatively decent amount of sleep. But if you're not as easily shaken up as I am, any hour of the day will suit you just fine! Although it's not my first-choice genre, I have seen quite a few war movies over the years. I often find even the mildest displays of violence and gore too bothersome for me to keep my eyes open, but compared to this film, those are all ""Hollywood"" style war depictions, glamorizing the concept of battle in order to ensure a decent range of viewers. ""Come and See,"" or ""Idi I Smotri"" is haunting yet captivating at the same time. As much as I didn't want to view the atrocious acts I knew were coming, I could not permit myself to move my eyes from the screen. Following Florya through this rendition of Russia in World War II is an experience that carries out beyond the image on the screen. It really pulls you into the action, causing the viewer to forget they are just watching a movie. The incredible images of Florya's surroundings in ruins, and the overwhelming sense of realism from the focus on each of the five senses, make Klimov's ""Come and See"" the most unique war film I have ever seen. There is no attractive hero, no romantic storyline, and no Hollywood typical ending, which separates this film from the genre-oriented industry. If you're sick of seeing the same movies over and over again, but with different titles and (sometimes) different actors, I would highly recommend giving ""Come and See"" a shot. This film cannot simply be read about for one to understand its powerful essence; it has to be witnessed firsthand. As Florya discovers the horrific reality of war, I felt as though I was discovering it with him. At the start of his journey, this young boy is very naive of this reality, but seems to ""age"" significantly from experiencing it. It's almost as though he sees the ""Hollywood"" version of war in his head, as he excitedly leaves home to join the soldiers in the woods. The happy look on his face is something I can recall, but can no longer imagine. After you witness his intensely horrified gaze, it doesn't leave your mind. You feel as though you're right there with him as he watches a church full of people burn to the ground, refuses to accept that his family has been murdered, and finally, when he intensely stares down Hitler's photo and fires his gun for the first time. Rather than feeling simply disturbed after this experience, I felt both enlightened and guilty. I learned a lot from this film, about both techniques in film making and the reality of WWII, which left me to my thoughts for quite a while after watching it. The feeling of guilt is due to the fact that I was watching this poor boy go through such terrible atrocities, and it truly felt as though I was a quiet bystander. It's easy to lose awareness that this boy is not really going through these things, and his captivating expressions, along with the incredible sound effects, are what made this so real to me. If this film was able to affect me so much from simply viewing it, I cannot even imagine what the real-life experience of WWII in Russia must have been like. Overall, it was worth being a little scared after watching this film. I know it's one of the few I will never forget, and an important one to have seen for anyone who's interested in an aspect of film.",

486,9 June 2010,SMCfilm,10," Reviews don't do this film justice, you must see it to judge for yourself.","I am not the type of person to watch a film about war. I would have never chosen to see this film on my own accord had it not been for my International Film class as I tend to stay toward happier and uplifting films, but I would have to say this is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen and for good reason. Having seen this film over a month ago, I can honestly say that it has truly reverberated with me as its message is so powerful. All five senses are impeccably impacted, whether by choice or not. This is the only film I have ever seen where sight, hearing, touch, taste and even smell has practically jumped off screen, impacting me in the most profound way. I felt as though my own nose was smelling the soup that Flyora and Glasha ate, just as I felt as though I was trekking through the swamp filled with sewage and bodies, just trying to make it across. This film is definitely not for those with weak stomachs, as there are many gruesome scenes. Although horrific, these scenes are what make the movie so real and honest. This is an honest portrayal of war and what happens, not the Hollywood version of it. Watching Flyora's transformation on screen from young boy to WWII Byelorussia war veteran, we see a complete alteration of him as a person. Midway through the film, we encounter his shift as he no longer looks like a boy, but weathered man with a constant stare on his face, as though he is no longer fazed by anything, be it life or death. The most horrific scenes in this film are the most powerful, from the burning of the shed to Flyora's dying father, this film does a wonderful job of evoking human emotion and sentiment. I believe that the most powerful scene however is when Flyora uses his gun for the first time throughout his entire journey, and that it is not aimed at a physical person. This film is extremely raw and stuns you as the movie continues. I was not able to comprehend some of the scenes that were occurring as they are so different from my day to day life, but they opened my eyes to the reality that is war. The soundtrack was almost eerie at times, mimicking the eerie scenes on screen. As Mozart's ""Requiem"" played, I couldn't help but be thankful that this is not my life, but merely a portrayal of someone else's, expressing the resilience and steadfast sense of purpose that those in combat must continue to have. I think that although I wasn't able to grasp the depth of some of the scenes as they were occurring, I was able to long after the film had ended, proving the immense impact it had on me personally. I wouldn't say that I enjoyed this film as that is not the correct word, but I was more entranced by not only its message but also its images. This is a must see for anyone, especially anyone interested in joining the army, as it gives an unfiltered perspective that is bound to impact you in one way or another.",

There is an eerie feel throughout the movie, i found it very haunting. It quickly became one of my favorite foreign movies. Overall my favorite scene was that of Florya and Glasha in the Forrest from their weird cry/laugh to their dancing in the rain, it all seemed so surreal. These two kids in the middle of War. Another thing I admire about Klimov's 'come and see' is that the movie is not about a victory, but one of a Belorussian village being burnt to the ground.

His name is Florya and before leaving for war, his mom desperately begs him to stay but he refuses without thoroughly thinking about it first. In my mind, he seems to have that mentality that he can handle any situation and before he knows it, he puts himself in a very deep rut like going to war, and he experiences horrific events. Such events include the burning of a whole village and innocent men, women and children inside it. Punishment in this country is run by drunken German soldiers who only focus on their military careers and sweeping people out by killing and torturing them. Elem Klimov's story of this experience during World War II has given me a broader perspective on how people should be treated and how important humanity is in our every day life. Not only this story has given me a drive to learn more about similar stories, but I have also learned more about the camera elements of it.",

494,30 July 2010,abigail-juaner,10, Come and see a boy who was robbed off of his youth and was forced to be a man through the horrors of war.,"Come and See aimed to tell not just another story of WWII, but the one that we have probably missed to recount. The Nazi occupation of Belorussia was almost overshadowed by the accounts of Holocaust, nevertheless, it was as tragic as the latter's story. This is not about the heroics of a few soldiers or the betrayal of a comrade. This is the story of the witnesses and casualties of war, the ones who were left unarmed and defenseless from extreme brutality. Elem Klimov's portrayal may not give you the adrenaline rush caused by heavy action fight scenes and he may not have shown a lot of bloodshed, but without a doubt, he will make you weak. He left me psychologically exhausted. The excellent sound design which gave a feeling of turbulence throughout the film will leave you in discomfort almost as if you were being assaulted. My senses were abused. The excruciating face of Florya, the image Glascha saw at his home and the whole scene of the village burned were all unforgettable and haunting. I was traumatized. Klimov's way of storytelling is not simply by making you watch it unfold, he will give you a sense of almost being there right beside Florya. And together, you are both scarred and changed for life.

A nuclear war could have broken out and engulfed the entire world in the same type of destruction that was demonstrated in the movie. It would really be a total war. One of the downsides of the movie is its bias. It shows the entire German army as villainous an heartless. The only signs of emotion are shown to simply make the movie more believable. The Soviet troops in actuality were probably just as brutal as the Germans since both sides were pulling out all the stops.

505,8 June 2008,NewFilmStudent,7, Brutal and real...,"This film showed the brutal reality of what war really is. It is frustrating to see how many lives are taken unnecessarily with out any remorse. And unfortunately to see a young boy's dream to be a good soldier for his country be trampled on. Florya gets a rude awakening when he experiences what war is really about and to see all the death at a very young age. Even though some scenes in the film are graphic, the director did a great job in making the death seem so real that as if you could actually smell the blood. The film was raw and making scenes so traumatic that they become embedded in your mind. Also the use of long continuous time takes allowed some scenes to be even more intense, for example when Florya and Glasha are in the mud pool and to see their struggle, their expressions made it even more real that it made you want help to pull them out. This film definitely makes the point across that it's not about the plot, but of the horrors of war. But to also see how young Florya aged through the film was amazing. To see his innocence in the beginning of the film and by the end it has diminished. War has literally stolen the life out of him. This film is brutal, raw but definitely amazing. Highly recommend",

I then think about how World War II was one of the deadliest wars ever with an estimated death toll of 62 to 78 million deaths. Come and See takes you on a very emotional journey about the story of a Belorussian boy, who is forced into the violence of war. It is an atrocious and brutal movie, but it is a story told like no other. We often see many movies about the Holocaust and Word War II, this movie is different.

The director Elem Klimov chose to show us the most horrible aspects of war and does so in such a way that mentally our senses our assaulted by the gritty depictions of war time horrors. The constant buzzing of the flies I immediately understood to be a tell-tale sign of death and their constant buzzing became a harbinger of sadness and heartbreak. In this film death often comes suddenly and without warning. Just the way it does in a real war. Throughout the film we see the main character Florya go from a wide-eyed boy filled with optimism into a haggard shadow of his former self, seemingly aged decades from the horrors he's forced to witness and survive through. Ironically these hardships forge him into very type of soldier that the Nazi's wanted to snuff out. Those with the will to fight, but more importantly a reason.",

509,31 July 2011,classicrocklover003,9, A Combination of Raw Realism and Artistic Surrealism,"Most people know the atrocities if WWII. It has been the subject of books, art and films since it's inception in the social consciousness. Although the story has frequently become a history book recital, what Klimov has done with his film ""Come and See"" makes a supremely profound impact on its cinematic viewers and changes the robotic understanding of one of the most painful times in world history. It is important to note the significance of the title, which comes from the biblical passage of the Apocalypse of John. In it, the beast teases John to look at the destruction of the Four Horsemen by whispering ""come and see."" This is the first powerful hint at the deep meaning of the film. Come and see refers not only to this biblical passage, but to the obvious destruction that Hitler ravaged upon the rest of the world. Hitler here, seems like the beast, bellowing to the world to ""come and see."" It is this manifestation of darkness and destruction that Klimov displays, and the artistry that Klimov uses to do so makes the film the masterpiece that it is. Florya, the protagonist of the story starts off as a naive boy, searching for a gun in an abandoned field, his mind filled with the glorified thoughts of war. As the film progresses, Florya's physical body, and especially his mental state, ages years, and the illusion of valiant fighting are replaced with the reality of the raw ""dirtiness"" of destruction and war. Frequently uncomfortable to watch, this film engages all th senses, you see the darkness of the world, smell the raw sulfur and gun powder in the air, hear the uncomfortable buzzing of the flies in the rotten world...it is almost unbelievable. The viewer wants to cry out, to make it stop, to turn away, but you cannot. Klimov displays something so captivating that regardless of how uncomfortable the trip of movie is, you feel obligated to fight through it, because you know, immediately that the magic of the film lies within. Cinematically, the composition is stunning. The mere use of the close-up, which in many films is flippantly accepted, is used in this film as a true testament of the emotional impact of its content. When we see close-ups of Florya's face throughout the film, we see his age progression and the callouses that have developed on his soul. It is not a cinematic trick or the power of makeup; it is clear that the actors of this film have forever been changed and aged by portraying the despair of the Belorussian villages during WWII. This film is not just another story of WWII, but it is a story of the humanism, or lack thereof, that the world can harbor and humans can release.",

Before I could only imagine the implications of a society where the survival of the fittest is the bottom line, and this movie helped me institutionalize it. The feeling of being on your own in wartime, and losing all you have, including your sanity, is greatly hinted in this movie for you.

It presents events as remembered, not as recorded, a movie of memories: not as experienced in the sense of the audience seeing or hearing what the protagonist sees or hears - but seeing events in the form they take in a person's mind, with all the power and flaws of human memory. The film is therefore episodic, disjointed, lacks scenes that would explain, has scenes that go on for a long time, lacks a story-line, shows events in a seemingly haphazard manner and at times makes little or no sense. These are the ragged memories of a boy who starts out naive and full of patriotic intentions, but by the end has possibly lost his mind.

We see the story through the eyes of Florya, a young boy thrust into the war by soviet partisans much to the dismay of his mother. We see the transition of a normal boy to an extremely disturbed young man. The more brutality he sees, the more his insanity increases. As hard as this film was to see, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. I found it visually stunning and highly recommend it to not only a film major but history buff as well.

At first, naive to the reality of war, Florya finds and gun and is excited to join the Russian militia-style resistance to the Nazis, much to the dismay of his mother. The time span of the movie is only over a few days, but the boy appears to age years over the horrific events he endures.

What follows is perhaps immeasurable and describable by words. In one of the most vivid, haunting, and probably best war films ever made, we follow Florya as he experiences the psychological horrors and grim, horrific realities of ordinary people and their lives on the brutal Eastern front. In a film which is a masterwork of soviet era expressionism, nightmarish surrealism with vivid images which will become burned into your mind, Come & See is far from the heroic, romantic war cinema of (great) films like Great Escape, Where Eagles Dare, or even the stunning Longest Day. Hell, this superb masterpiece even makes Das Boot or A Bridge Too Far look like light-hearted romanticism. This film is a haunting nightmarish opera, absolutely overflowing in its creative genius and vision and technical proficiency. Cinematography is stunning. So many bold, mindblowing images, horrific scenes of Einsatzgruppen brutality are given a poetic beauty to them, while cameras flow intricately through them. Burning villages, savage slaughterings, soldiers emerging from the woods like ghosts and hysterical, blaring crowds pleading for mercy - this film weaves them all with godly precision. The music intertwined with surrealist imagery and perhaps the best sound engineering out of any film i've ever seen are both integral. The acting is moving with the hithereto unknown Aleksey Kravchenko exacting a mindblowingly horrific performance as the young boy Florya - who's expressions capture the sheer terror experienced by millions all over the Eastern Front. Technically brilliant, excellently scored and shot, emotional, horrific, brutal, surreal and vivid, this strange masterwork of a war film picks up and improves exponentially on works such as Apocalypse Now & Catch-22.

The movie did show that Florya was sane at first but then after fighting throughout most of his life show that he was starting to loose his mind.

And I looked, and behold a pale horse; and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him."" This 1985 anti-war film directed by Elem Klimov opens with two boys playing at war, but in a terrifyingly surreal manner, heightened by the younger boy emitting grotesque, chilling words that sound more beastlike than human. A hyper-realistic quality inhabits the entire film, made more horrifying by sound design which sounds as if we are experiencing everything through 14 yr old Flyora's eyes AND ears...there are sounds that occur throughout...both identifiable and all too realistic, but just as often not identifiable but sounding alive/organic, what cringing or squeamish might shound like...or like life slipping away. Aleksei Kravchenko* who plays Flyora has an incredibly expressive face ...and closeups force us to feel what he's feeling. The entire film was mesmerizingly painful. I'm going to have to go read up on the cinematographer and sound design to try to understand how that contributed mightily to feeling submerged into, suffused with and overwhelmed by Flyora's experience. *In reading through Critereon's ""ComeAndSee_press-notes_r1_original.pdf"", I just learned that Kravchenko ""had never appeared in a film before""...astonishing given his masterful performance in this film...in fact none of the characters were professional actors.",

I think Come And See is more realistic than Private Ryan. Successful art directing is one reason, the another reason is the usage of long take. There was montage at Private Ryan, when Soldiers reach the shore. It was the coolest war scene maybe but it was realistic due to special effects but montage faded it a little bit. In Come and See you see everything with long take, it gives a more documentary feeling. It deals racism without being racist, at least one German soldier was crying during the massacre.

My father was not very pleased telling me these stories. It always made him very emotional. Now back to the film, just seeing the way the Nazi soldiers had treated these Russian villagers had made me very uncomfortable and sensitive inside. It made me think, how could the other nations not see what is going on here? Why? Ugh.

I watched the movie fully in russian, so I can't tell how good the translation is. Compared to Idi i smotri, the movies mentioned above seem to be shallow in terms how they portray the sheer madness of war, and give you the chance to understand what it could've felt like. 
The movie starts very unspectacular somewhere in Byelorussia and while the war is somewhere around, it is not that present. The situation seems to be ok. As the movie progresses, the situation portrayed in the movie just gets worse and more dire. No happy end and no heroes to be found here.

Around him moves a group of German SS troops leaving carnage as they massacre the women children and elderly men in the villages.

564,9 June 2010,lizzzyj,8," Horrifying, stunning and powerful","""Come and See"" is a Russian film that was filmed about the post soviet era. It shows how Russia was invaded by the Nazis. It was to me a very haunting and disturbing film that portrays to the viewers some of what went on in World War II on the Russian front. It starts off kind of difficult to understand, and I wasn't sure what certain characters were doing. But shortly after, I found that this was going to be a great film. The title of the movie is basically saying, ""Come and see what war is all about""...and the movie shows it like no other. My professor showed it in my film class and prepared us for the gore. It was brutally realistic with most of the scenes that will stay imprinted in my mind for a long time. The movie did stick to the Soviets as the good guys, but really portrayed the casual brutality of the Parisian warfare. There were two scenes that really stuck out to me that I felt were very powerful, but also so disturbing. The first one was when the main character by the name of Flor, and a girl he befriended have to run for their lives as bombs are being thrown all around them. The only way to get to the other side is to swim through a sewage-like swamp, barely being able to keep their heads above. It was not only excruciating, but disgusting at the same time. God only knows what was in that swamp, and they had no other choice. Plus the background noise and music made the scene so intense it kept me at the end of my seat. The second scene that I found I still can't get over is when the Nazis brutally destruct a Russian village. It is a horrific, and such a sad scene that I almost couldn't even watch. A shed was burnt down full of civilians in it...children, women and men burnt alive. You could hear the people screaming and crying for help as the Nazis sat back and laughed and clapped, and embraced each other. And they all start to shoot at the shed also, the scene was terrifying and unforgettable. The sight was just horrific, along with the yodeling and music in the back round. The whole scene was just a gruesome massacre. The ending I found to be quite touching in an odd kind of way, but I will leave that for the viewers. Overall I found the movie to be really good as I rarely watch films like this. It did remind me a little of ""Saving Private Ryan"", which was another horrifying war movie that I had seen a long time ago. ""Come and See"" is a great movie as long as you are prepared to be shocked and see some brutal scenes. But it is a take on the reality of what can, and does go on at war. I think it is a film that if not all, at least most adults should see.",

567,8 February 2011,sherving55,8, A Great War Film,"This film is a gut wrenching experience that will test a viewer's limits. The realistic sense of this film does so much to heighten the brutality of what is being shown. The story is what I would assume war is like, as in not glorified, but shows unbelievable hardships of a young boy who has joined the partisans. The way Klimov shot the film, where scenes like the crossing of the bog were real and not staged also helped with the realistic sense, but also with the horrifying feeling this film gives off. This film also does a great job to make you feel the crazy that is happening in the movie. Scenes are not shown with a great amount of details of explanation, they are felt though, which is why it is such an intense movie. It literally feels like you are there with Florya. Just too quickly mention, some scenes seem to be amazingly realistic and that's because they probably are. The film really does show the unimaginable effects of war. You can see how everything is damaged, like how nature is destroyed with the dropping bombs, how innocent people are massacred. The psychological, emotional, mental and physical torment people must go through just to survive is depicted flawlessly in this film. I don't think I can stress it enough, but all these things rub off on viewers. Viewers watch as the Nazi enter a village and massacre an entire village as they celebrate and take pictures. Then it moves onto these same Germans and Russian collaborator begging for forgiveness and not be killed by the partisans. The question that should come up as this scene unravels is what should happen to these Germans. Is it okay to brutally kill these captured Germans? After all that is what war is is it not?",

The first time I saw it, went almost berserk within the very depths of my soul -there's far too much about feeling, understanding, witnessing and living in this movie to stay quiet and phlegmatic after having watched it. Is it the very opening of the movie that brings this state of facts, as you're told you're just poor little bastards who can't understand anything of what's going on, that you'd remember everything keeps going on and on and on without you to escape it? Is it because these first sentences I can't quote are dedicated to the young protagonist in which we will entirely penetrate? Or may it be due to the almost unreal living reality the entire movie flashes over you? That very feeling that you could have done such things, in such a situation, that every guy down here might be anything we usually like to consider as morally impossible? Will you bare the absolute passivity of civilians -if we can call 'passivity' the fact of trying to save one's life by helping anyone stronger than one is? Maybe it is just because it depicts reality as it might be -not understandable, not to be focused on, not to be made or modified as we'd like it to be, but just as something you can't escape, that stands still when you're happy, when you're suffering, and dying.. Go and watch this movie -this is for sure. Look at it as it is -a requiem for loads of massacres -the first of all being perhaps one of instinct... Go, watch this movie. And feel hard for long.

It just shows the horrors of war through a young boy who volunteer for a partisan. Also, a film has no heroism, no distinguishing oneself in war, and no impressive speech. There are just deaths, brutalities, and victims. Survival in war only depends on luck. Most war films are wanted to have elements of reversal, but at the same time they also are wanted to be heroism. However, in this film 'Come and See' does not have these elements at all. This film only tells us that there are no bad guys, good guys or justice in war. There is only one thing, victim.",
570,28 November 2001,twiglet-1,3, not as advertised,"I thought the movie was average at best!  If you like artsy films, you might like this.  There were some very good scenes that were enjoyable to watch, and made it somewhat interesting to watch.  But, it had about 2 hours of boring scenes that were not that eventful.  I don't want to think how it felt or have some weird imagery, I wanted to see more actual fighting, and how the war was perceived by soldiers not a 12 year old boy  The movie was not cohesive at all it reminded my of a Thin Red Line, if you like that movie you would like this.  I would imagine most war movie fans would not like this movie.   Save your money and pass this one up!!",
571,18 November 2020,florin_marinescu2003,4, waste of time!,"I saw, not long time ago, some real good russian movies about war (WW2 and Afghanistan): this one is not amongst them. After reading a couple of reviews, I decided to se this movie but now I just want my two hours back! We have not to forget the atrocities of the war, but this movie is forgetable. The intention of director it was obviously to create a shocking movie about war and the crimes of nazis against innocent people, but he failed. His creation is just extremely boring!",
572,2 July 2021,avmillerdesigns,10," Upsetting, raw, real.",This movie was disturbing AF. Gave me that feeling that my families in danger. I had to leave the room a couple times. The ending was perfect and such a wake up call. May we never forget!,
573,14 May 2005,subsur,9, time is a good indicator of greatness,"i saw this movie first time 18 years ago. at that time high school kids in Russia were kinda forced to watch this film as a reminder of what happened. i liked the film a lot. 2 images got stuck in my mind - a raped girl and old lady on a bed in the middle of nowhere. i've been wanting to watch this film again for the past 5 years and finally got a hand on DVD. too bad there are no extras except very short text by Sean Penn. i watched it again, almost 2 decades since my first viewing. the movie is one of the best films showing the side effect of wars without really glorifying the combat part of it. there is no superficial philosophizing, just very internal representation of reality as seen / felt by a young boy. in my opinion, there are only 2 films that can stand in the same raw with ""come and see"" - Apocalypse Now and Thin Red Line.",
574,1 August 2022,delpierothecapitano,9, Masterpiece simply but,I think you should do more movies about horrible war crimes going on right now in Palestine and Syria and in Africa and all around the world but from a European prospective.,
575,9 August 2021,redat1,10," Graphic, disturbing, and undeniably brilliant depiction of war","Not every movie of this quality can be found in full on YouTube. And yet, here we are. If it wasn't so readily available, I don't think I would've watched it.",
576,30 May 2012,blythejulian,9, Very depressing,"Come and See was impressive and at the same time the kind of movie that has you leave the room unable to speak to your friends until the movie leaves your head. It starts off slow, building some momentum as it goes when you grasp the location, time, and situation. Slowly the movie turns itself upside down then flips you right side up every now and then, then repeats the process. The movie becomes more and more insane, and right when it hits rock bottom, it gives our protagonist a bit of pause where he laughs and calms his nerves... Slightly.",
577,18 August 2021,samuel-brounstein,9, Is this movie too disturbing for you?,Is it worth traumatizing yourself just to see a great piece of art AND a realistic portrayal of WWII? That's the funereal allure around Come and See. I have a good constitution for disturbing content that I built up over years of watching films. I could not handle watching this masterpiece in one sitting.,
578,24 May 2014,maxwellwyman,9," Great film, hard to enjoy for all the right reasons","As everyone else has already mentioned, this is an extremely disturbing, gritty, realistic, and impressive Russian war movie. Having a young adult (although by the end of the movie he is mentally transformed far beyond his age) as the main character was a unique choice for a war film and is just another way to make everything in this film seem even more shocking. And this young actor, Aleksei Kravchenko, is a perfect fit. His faces and movements perfectly display the extreme emotional turmoil that any of these situations would create. The writing and dialogue was a minimal part of this movie for me (although that could have been because I don't speak the language and had to focus on subtitles) but the message is easily communicated across any language barriers simply because of the bleak imagery and this feeling of dread and horror that I rarely come across even in legitimate horror movies. War is hell. I think that's the point of the movie and it definitely succeeds in showing that. There are way too many brilliant, memorable, but disgusting scenes of wartime atrocities, some of them bordering on surrealistic hallucinations (similar to some parts of Apocalypse Now), especially with the help of a very strange and unsettling drone/ambient soundtrack meant to simulate the confusion of bombings and shellshock. There are parts that drag a little bit, but not for long. Powerful scenes are spread evenly throughout the film and at the end the viewer should be left ragged. I certainly was. Some of the worst moments are stuck in my head whenever this movie comes to mind. Although this is a brilliant movie, it's hard for me to say I really enjoyed it, seeing as I usually enjoy lighthearted and beautiful movies. It was hard to watch but for all the right reasons. So on two different scales:",
579,5 June 2012,tomajfatemi,8," Come and See, was very good movie because","Come and See, was very good movie because its way of showing us the strong emotions that was expressed by characters when they experienced true horrors of Nazi occupation. It made me, and believe anyone that has ever see it emotional effected by it, and its because of not making it unreal by putting unreal special effects and other stuff that typical Hollywood movies have. It also, didn't just show a Russian interpretation of the war, that was a glories victory of the great Soviet union an Stalin, instead it showed the true suffering and killing of ordinary people in Russia.",
580,5 October 2008,colinferrissss,10, Quite simply the best war film ever made,"This is the film that shows what total war in the East must have been like. The plight of the civilian and bestiality of the invader is expressed from the viewpoint of the a maddened young boy partisan. A film of great horror and also lyrical beauty it is nevertheless also restrained. Avoiding what would be unwatchable if shown truthfully, it nevertheless sears the mind like no other war film. The boy begins by wanting to be a soldier and to his frustration is kept behind as too young. Then he sees what soldiers do and learns to hate them. Finally he has no choice but to carry on. An anonymous accepted member of the group and disconnected from any other life which the war has killed.",
581,15 August 2020,charliebarron-09028,10, The greatest yet most disturbing movie to date,"How can I put it into perspective, this movie is a MASTERPIECE.not only of Soviet cinema which is more amazing than people think. Lots of people my age wouldn't twice about this but I really wish they could.I even think it's possibly one of the greatest foreign movies of all time. Its definitely up there with classics like the seven samurai, Cinema paradiso, life is beautiful and even a more recent one city of godand of course I'm forgetting other great foreign movies that definitely deserve a good mention. But never have I felt like I was part of a movie more than this you all most feel like a witness and at points the main character in the movie the 15 year old flora, who goes through the entire movie in a constant state of planning and a sense that we're losing our minds throughout this. From joining the war effort against the nazis to being right in the epicentre of a ton of Nazi war crimes that would make anyone feel uneasy to then finally having that final moment of the moment of the movie which something I felt on a personal level. This movie is as harrowing as much as it's GREAT. I hope more people know about this movie and give it a chance. It really makes you appreciate life more and is a great insight and a respectful one to those who unfortunately lost their lives and humility because of this war, any war for that matter, it can take a toll on are mental capacity more than we think. And yes it deserves a 10 out of 10 any day of the week.",
582,18 October 2021,aidanmoran-36647,10, Perfect,"Come and See (1985) is one of those films whose authority is established from its opening moments. Out in the open air, an elderly peasant dressed in a soft-peaked beret is volleying a mixture of threats and imprecations into some bracken-strewn sand dunes: Whoever is hiding in there (we gather they are kids: ""little brats,"" ""stinking bastards"") had better come out! After a few more insults, the man mounts his cart and, with a flick of the whip, prepares to move off. The force of the opening sequence alone derives partly from its bold use of close-up. The film actually starts with a close-up-the back of the peasant's head-and this is surely unusual (most filmmakers would be inclined to start with a more general establishing shot). The image of the younger child walking toward us, mouthing his deep-throated curses, delivers a sinister frisson that is nothing but disorienting. In fact, he is walking toward his friend, but it seems to be us he is addressing so impudently; and this frontality of gaze, pinning us down with its candor, returns at different times over the course of the film-we might even say it constitutes the film's stylistic signature, along with director Elem Klimov's amazing use of Steadicam. Thus, in the forest, the boy Flyora (Alexei Kravchenko)-the laughing child from the opening scene-and the girl Glasha (Olga Mironova) stare at each other in rapture, their mutual curiosity communicated through a series of striking matching close-ups. Here, at this early stage of the drama, the different pairs of eyes addressing us are vivid with feeling and youthfulness. Later, close-ups of the boy and the girl will only show numbness, revenge, or despair-eyes that have all but ceased to see, in response to enveloping horrors. Flyora continues to tred through this demented reality, the benign coloured past leaving him behind, breaking his spirit and leaving nothing except more doubt in his soul - the finishing sequence being him killing Hitler as a baby - a scene that will stay with you forever.",
583,5 July 2021,jacknpoe,5, I don't like it.,"Bad light, bad film, no timing, very crazy people treated like they are normal. Noisy, histerical, teatrical. Sometimes the plot changes and it's hard to keep it. The camera moves are bad too.",
584,16 September 2021,timebandit-73280,1, So Much for Reading Reviews!,"I believe those that rated this movie anywhere close to 5 or above are either being forced to do so or will personally profit from the sale of it. I forced myself to watch all of it, waiting for the Big Finish but only got a waste of time. I get it, these events really happened, but so did many other movie plots. As for showing what really happened in a believable way? This movie is about as unrealistic as it gets and the acting is HORRIBLE.",
585,27 April 2023,mike-91096,3, What did I just watch?,"I had high expectations for this movie based off user reviews, but was very disappointed. For the first 75% of the movie it's hard to understand the directors vision. Voices are dubbed over and don't match the age of the character, some actors seem to be laughing at awkward times, staring endlessly into the camera while having some sort of psychotic breakdown every time. It's confusing and scenes feels drawn out unnecessarily. I'm left feeling anxious, waiting for something to happen, almost wanting to fast forward to get to something that makes sense and pulls me into the movie. The underage teen girl dancing in a wet/revealing shirt was weird and disturbing. The last 25% was better. Could have been better in many areas.",

587,26 July 2011,bluvme4,8, Thoughts on the movie.,"This movie was very touching. I was engulfed in emotion while watching it. I enjoyed when the movie went from and objective to subjective view when the bombs were dropping on Florya and Galasha. That moment really made me feel like apart of the movie. I had to keep reminding myself that it was just a movie. The scenes were, not so much graphic but I feel it was the fact that they were so genuinely composed. Watching them struggle through the swamp I wondered why am I watching this but at the same time I could feel all the pain and desperation. I felt that the movie was self referential in its regard to ""killing the children"" when Florya stepped on the bird eggs. Its not the same as killing the children so that they don't turn into dangerous people, but maybe to save them from growing up in a world full of bomb, guys, fire and violence. Another thing I noticed was when Florya told Galaha ""I'll save all of you"" it wasn't just about Galasha, it was about all the people who needed to be saved.",
588,4 June 2012,filmingchange,8, The Power of Cinema all in ONe!!,"Understanding the power of cinema isn't just a simple norm or I deal concept that you can simply acquire when watching a movie. Cinema is more than just a form of pass time it's a form of art. This Film ""Come and See"" by Elem Klimov is a great example of what cinema has to offer to those whom wish to pursue a career in cinematography; it touches upon the idea that cinema can change and invoke emotional imprecations from past events like World War II. This film brings the viewer into the action and provokes you to smell, feel, and almost taste the gore that surrounds the entire movie from start to finish. We see a Great use of visual directionality in demonstrating the idea of pain and distress from the cause and effect in the film. This film as much as it illustrates the history of the past it manages to put you inside the realistic factors of what war is all about in a form that is hardly never seen in cinema. If you plan on watching the film be ready to take use of all your five senses; Fair warning the film can be too much to handle, but it's simply a small pick into what hell on earth truly looks like; and enjoy. POV: Loved It !!!",

591,19 January 2021,tacohemingway,7, Artistically great,"Worth seeing as it tells a dark aspect of WWII that seems as to not be known in foreign countries other than former country-members of Soviet Union. As it comes for the film itself, its artistic side is extraordinary. It has a specific tone with a lot of scenes that are consider to be a metaphorical (or maybe even surreal) way of showing the terror which those people experienced. Moreover, merely the shots with the protagonist's facial expressions, which are highly reminiscent of ""The Scream"" painting, is a great example of both the artistic side and the specific tone.
Highly recommended, especially for war-movies-to-see lists.",
