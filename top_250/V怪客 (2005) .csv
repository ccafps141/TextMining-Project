Governments should be afraid of their people.""","Placed in futuristic Britain, this movie tells a story about dictatorship and the man who became symbol of it's downfall.

1,31 October 2016,seige-hound,10, My Personal Favourite Movie of All Time,"It's been quite a few years since I first saw V for Vendetta. I didn't see it at release, because I was far under the age demographic at that time, but I managed to catch up to the film at around 2011-2012. Not sure the exact year, but I was a teenager at the time, and I loved the Matrix (still do), and heard that V for Vendetta was written by the Wachowskis, so I thought I'd give it a shot.",r

The police have spies and cameras everywhere, their eyes and ears observe the wires, seize and snare, but disguises cause surprises, hero V knifes, Fawkes and prises, to derail those, that sit in the top chairs.

And is a real reflection of what's going on as of right now. On top of that. It's a fun ride with great acting and a fantastic cast. If you watch this movie. You should realize the goal of all politicians. Absolute control and rule thru whatever means necessary. All governments should be de-centralized And this movie shows what happens when people let the government run rough shot.,r

11,28 March 2006,cosmic_quest,10, Very powerful even if it makes Thatcherism look heavenly!,"'V for Vendetta' will no doubt be remembered as being one of the most well-produced films of this decade for its powerful script, strong character depictions and the sheer excellence in terms of quality. Loosely based on the DC Comic, the film is set in a totalitarian Britain where the BNP-like government who run the country with an iron fist that they make Thatcher's Tories look positively warm and trustworthy. Then emerges a vigilante in the form of V, a man deformed by fire and the governmental experiments that have given him enhanced strength, who is determined to free the UK from dictatorship by blowing up the Houses of Parliament.

13,10 October 2020,Benjamin-M-Weilert,8, An eerily prescient indictment on the trade between safety and freedom.,"It's a little weird watching a dystopian movie like V for Vendetta (2005) in 2020. I watched this film each year around the 5th of November, but life eventually got in the way and made it difficult to continue the tradition. At the time, I enjoyed the ""underdog"" of V (Hugo Weaving) protecting art and freedom of thought from the tyranny of an oppressive government. Having gone back and re-watched it in the current global climate, I'm honestly shocked at how prescient it was in predicting a lot of our future. Hopefully, things don't become worse to the point of completely fulfilling this prophecy.",9

15,25 March 2006,LordBlacklist,10, This is one of the best films I have ever seen...,"...I am well aware that my summary line invites several retorts, and given the nature of my comment those retorts may very well be resoundingly, unanimously negative. If I say ""This is one of the Best films I have ever seen..."" One would think the immediate response would be, ""Then you must not have seen many films in your time, dear boy."" Butoh I have, and it has been far too long since there has been something up on that screen in the darkened theater that I enter to leave this boring, monotonous existence that had the capacity to inspire. To see the possibilities of what might be, what could never be, and what could happen if the leaders of the world keep things going in the directions that they are headed. V For Vendetta is just a film, yes? But it is also a wake up call of which there are not enough in this time we live in. It speaks directly to the hardship that we endure but seldom take notice of because we are distracted by things that do not matter...upon leaving the theater I saw people, teenagers mostly, the very people who should be pro-actively questioning the methodical erosion of this thing called government in the modern age, react with complete apathy. Most try so hard to be so outwardly different from the rest that they do not realize that in doing this they become just like everyone else; oblivious. We as a society do not want to see films like this, we do not want to acknowledge the atrocities going on in the world, all we want to do is play our video games, watch reality television, spend our money on clothes, jewelry, entertainment. Things that for all intents and purposes we do not need. These are the distractions that keep society from pondering in the wee hours of the night what they can do to prevent true injustice. The evils committed by those that govern are far worse than any fiction the cinema can dazzle us with these days. Yes this is a truly great film and one that I will cherish for a long time. I can only hope that its message finds a wide audience that is open to seeing things from another perspective, in a uniquely human light. In the end that is what the film is about...being human. Having the capacity to choose weather or not to recognize the evils of society and take a stand to make things better than they are. The film of course takes this idea to extremes but for the viewing public dramatic examples are needed to awake them from this artificially induced state of being we call existence and say, ""I see there is wrong, and it is my duty as a human being to do what I can to make it right."" To the makers of this unique and wonderful film, I salute you.",4

It seemed a tad too cartoonish in the first few minutes so we gave up on it when we first tried to watch many years ago. I am glad we gave it another view tonight-it could be a movie about the events happening today and so very realistic it is frightening.
It has a good storyline and the acting is well done. More importantly is the message it carries and we should all take that message seriously if we don't want to end up living in a country governed by martial law, fear and loss of freedom.",?

Granted, it was borne out of disillusionment and rage over Bush and Blair's corrupt handling of domestic and foreign affairs back in the day and post-9/11 (hence the themes of Islamophobia). But with time the film has only become more topical than it was in 2006, when I was asleep and didn't even know of its existence. More than a decade later, I have finally now seen it and I am left wondering what lessons we as a people still have yet to learn about our governments and their descent into totalitarianism.

Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) is a naive young Londoner who is saved from a gang of lascivious policemen by V (Hugo Weaving), a mysterious man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask. V soon initiates a campaign of terrorism against Sutler's government, hoping to spark a popular insurrection. He uses his charm and coercion to convert Evey to his cause, and soon the public begins to tire of being oppressed. Police Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea), who is assigned to track down V, begins to uncover evidence of government atrocities during the course of his investigation.

57,26 February 2006,GreenPlastikMan,9, Truly Unique,"There are some that will, upon seeing this film, say that it was akin to Andrew Lloyd Weber attempting to make a political statement: overly dramatic. These people would be well served to remember that the symbol of drama is a mask, which certainly begs one important question- Why, if you are so put off by an overtly dramatic motion picture, would you choose to see a movie that stars as the (anti)hero a man in a mask? I just saw this film at an advanced screening and I must say it is nothing short of uniquely brilliant. Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio-political message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure.",

61,2 May 2018,nicholasjcourville,10, Want to see where the anonymous mask came from?,"V for Vendetta is still after all these years one of my favorite movies to watch, and I find it as relevant today as it was whenever it was released in 2005. It is a story about a freedom fighter whose goal is to take down a totalitarian government that uses fear and deceit to control its people. To do this, he knows that one man is not enough to accomplish such a monumental feat and that he will need to use something that cant be silenced, hurt, or killed. he sets out with the goal of planting the idea of revolution in the people because, as he says in the movie ""Ideas are bulletproof."" 
One of my favorite things about this movie is that the main character is wearing a solid mask. It is a fantastic display of acting, both voices acting as well as physical. I guess you could say that I found myself not liking the character as much as I loved the idea of the character. The writers and director did an amazing job of drawing me into the storyline by mirroring enough of the world we live in today that I felt that the world I was watching on the screen could very easily enough being the world I live in one day. I saw myself in many of the characters and identified with their blind devotion to their country, their developing distrust of their government, and their inner conflict of trying to rationalize the two. 
Hugo Weaving plays the leading role of V and delivers and an unbelievable performance from behind a mask. Natalie Portman plays the role of V's sidekick, love, and accomplice. Stephen Rea plays the detective that is hell-bent on finding out the truth even if that means he must accept that all his life he has been on the wrong side. Many other great actors help director James McTeigue bring The Wachowski Brothers V for Vendetta to life. It is definitely worth your time. Please watch and enjoy this movie,",

You have civil war closing on US. You literally have a whole package of 2020-2021 and it feels as if it was filmed yesterday. People can only dream of blowing up parliament.

V probes the purpose of government and brings up themes which contemporary Americans seem to have forgotten - the basic concepts of the separation of church and state, government by and for the people, the right to overthrow leaders who exercise their own will at the expense of the nation.

77,20 June 2009,pfgpowell-1,3," Banal, pretentious and extraordinarily silly.","What an extraordinarily silly film V For Vendetta turns out to be. It is almost breathtaking in its banality. And the odd things is that for the first 10/15 minutes you feel you are in for something quite enjoyable. To begin with it is intriguing: who is this guy in the Guy Fawkes mask, what will happen to Natalie Portman, just how did to Old Blighty end up as a fascist dictatorship, what is the mystery of the Larkhill Centre? And most important, how did V acquire his almost superhuman powers, what are his resources (for example, towards the end of the film apparently issuing, at the very least, most of the population of London with a Guy Fawkes mask, a hat and a black cape like his own. Couldn't have been much of a queue at the post office when he went.) But we get no answers at all, at least none which will satisfy anyone with even half a brain. And when I say it just gets sillier and sillier, I don't in any way mean that the silliness can, as it often is in films, enjoyably silly. V For Vendetta takes itself far too seriously for that. We get a load of half-baked, juvenile cod political philosophy, an entirely obscure storyline about the persecution of both male and female homosexuals (and where did that come from. It is shoehorned into the film so maladroitly that it's as though a new film is starting) some silliness about Guy Fawkes falling in love with Natalie Portman and a couple of coppers who aren't quite as bad as the rest of those in authority. There are obvious points to be made - would the whole police investigation of this 'terrorist' really consist of a chief inspector and his sidekick (not, alas, a lovable but rather stupid cockney)? How does this idiot in the mask get around London undetected - he sticks out like a sore thumb. And just how did Britain accept a fascist dictatorship. But even asking those questions means taking V For Vendetta even a little but seriously and - well, it really doesn't deserve it. It is, to use an old-fashioned British phrase, complete b*ll*ks which goes downhill all the way. The Wachowski brothers (with Larry now apparently - according to IMDb - now shacked up with a 'professional dominatrix' who 'keeps him as her slave': put that in your pipe and smoke it) were responsible for the Matrix franchise. I haven't seen any of them, but if V For Vendetta is anything to go by, I shan't be bothering this side of my death. It is lazy, pretentious, superficial and a waste of anyone's time. I did think of being a little bit charitable and allowing that as it was apparently co-produced by DC Comics, it might score if you saw it as a filmed comic. But that won't wash.

Even given that Alan Moore's complex tale has been stripped to the bone (perhaps inevitably, as otherwise we'd be looking a looong film), it's far too wordy for most action-movie audiences  and, by the same reckoning, too violent for more thoughtful patrons. There are allusions to 'America's War' in the near-past, and of how religious fundamentalism and intolerance have come to shape the dystopia represented, but these connections are astonishingly heavy handed and unsubtle. This, plus the Wachowski Brothers fondness for cod-philosophising reduces Moore's incisive wit into something more blunt and unsubtle.

84,11 October 2006,TOMASBBloodhound,6, This film in the top 250? I think not.,"V for Vendetta is an ambitious, but tragically flawed film from such minds as Wachowski, Wachowski, and Silver. The story centers around the efforts of a masked hero/villain who wishes to take down a fascist government which has seized power in 2020 London. V, as he's known, is quite a character. He can carve up an entire unit of policemen with guns while at the same time quoting Shakesparre. He seems to be everywhere at once as the government is unable to nab him or even slow him down. He boasts that on the fifth of November of the following year, he's going to pull off some elaborate stunt that will somehow bring the government to it's knees. Can he be stopped? Should he be stopped? In the simplest of terms, this film has good things and bad things in it. The good: Well, the acting was very good. Hugo Weaving, though he's hidden under a mask for the entire film, gives everything he can to the role of V. He speaks with an eloquence, he moves like a cat, and he's given all the best lines. Natalie Portman is better than you'd think as the young woman who helps and is helped by V after getting into a sticky situation with some corrupt cops in an early scene. Her despair and disillusionment harden to resolve quite believably by the film's end. Stephen Rea is terrific as a detective trying to get to the bottom of the mystery man's plot. John Hurt is appreciated in no matter what role he plays in any film. The film is a treasure to look at, despite the numerous grisly scenes used to depict this terrible world of the future.",

The film kicks off far too early with the evilness surrounding the state thrown at our faces in a very sudden fashion. We aren't given any build up to Portman's character, nor to that of 'V' and as a result, it takes a lot longer for us to 'get to know' them as the film goes on. This twinned with the fact that when we should have been properly introduced, we're given a brief and rather ugly introduction to Guy Fawkes and the history surrounding him, obviously one for the Americans as anyone who has been to a November the 5th BBQ or fireworks party really doesn't need this sort of beginning, in fact the film would've benefited from more of a build up involving the corruption in the state and the past trauma's surrounding the main characters.

But to say that I haven't been this excited about a film brought by Andy and Larry Wachowski, the Matrix creators, since their 1999 ground-breaker, is saying a lot. Some may not like the film, or may not 'get' it, as it does go for a lot of dialog and character development over useless explosions and violence (of course there's some in the film, but no in over-abundance). But it is, like the first Matrix, quite challenging in the futuristic story kind of way, taking more from Orwell this time at a look of totalitarian society and the humanism that lies beneath terror and fear through dominance.

There are also several other annoying problems with this film: First, it invokes the example of Guy Fawkes from history as a basis for its agenda, but seems completely ignorant about who Fawkes was or why he did what he did. Fawkes was not an anarchist. He was a frustrated Roman Catholic who was attempting to disrupt the protestant regime of the Stuarts and reinstate Catholicism in 17th century England. He believed that Catholics were being persecuted under the protestants, but in actuality religious persecution had been greatly reduced from the terrors wrought by Mary Tudor (Bloody Mary) upon protestants. In any case, Fawkes attempt was a dismal failure, and the Stuarts and Parliament continued to rule. Eventually it was the protestant movement that elevated the democratic power of parliament over the Crown and instated the constitutional monarchy. The original poem ""Remember"" referred to in the film is actually a warning against Fawkes and his ilk, and a prayer of thanks for his failure and the continued peace of the nation and its king.

120,5 November 2015,ironhorse_iv,9," Remember! Remember! The 5th of November! While, V for Vendetta; V also stands out for victorious! What a great watch!","People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people. Indeed, V for Vendetta directed by James McTeigue kinda shows that. Based on the comic book by Alan Moore and David Lloyd. This controversy movie tells the story of shadowy freedom fighter, only known by the alias of ""V"" (Hugo Weaving) trying to commit terrorist attacks against the fascist government of Britain with the help of an young woman, named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman). Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I love the obvious symbolism, in which; this movie is trying to say. Indeed, the idea of self-expression is hard to kill. This is a physical representation of one of V's guiding principles. While, Hugo Weaving is indeed playing as 'V', you never once, see his face, just his voice. This is very important for the film to do, because the purpose of the mask was for it, to be the symbol of opposition and revolt against the ruling class. I think, this idea somewhat works. Even though that was never Moore's intent, to have Guy Fawkes masks, feature in the comics. The mask model after Guy Fawkes, a 17th century man known for attempting to blow up the British Parliament, has become, so much more, outside from the media, in which it came from. It became the symbol of free-will. The mask has become so popular, that it also began to represent the new world of 21th century social activism. Like V in the film, Guy Fawkes, seem like a folk-tale hero to uninformed. However, in reality, both characters 'heroic' status is highly dubious. First off, I wouldn't call, the real-life, Guy Fawkes, a hero. After all, the Gunpowder Plot wasn't really to strike a blow for freedom, they simply wanted to replace the Protestant king with a Catholic one. Further, more, they packed in so much gunpowder that hundreds, possibly thousands of innocent civilians would have been killed. So thank goodness that it failed. Lastly, Guy Fawkes wasn't even a core member of the conspiracy, but a minor mercenary, who didn't do a good job, hiding the gunpower. To most historian, he was more idiotic, than a genius. Anyways, the reason why the British celebrate, Guy Fawkes Night, isn't because how heroic, he was. The true reason, they celebrate it, is because he fail, allowing Protestant to continue to rule the masses, there. By modern standards, both V & Guy Fawkes are depraved terrorists, nothing less. So for the film to present V as more of a good guy and fascism leader, Adam Sulter (John Hurt) as 100% evil. It resulted in a more black and white viewpoint than the more complex side from the comic book, in which you don't know, for sure, who is the good guys. While, Norsefire in the comics, were still a repressive dictatorship. At least, the characters within it, was a little more complex, than the disappointing clear-cut villains, we have here. In many ways, I wish the movie was like, the comic, with its biblical theme. The villain, Adam Susan AKA Sulter, in the comics, represented how society need to stick to its notion of purity. His solipsist belief that he control fate, is similar to that of Adam from Genesis. He genuinely believes that self-choice is dangerous & that V represented the devil. The choice to not obey, but live life as your own. Evey represented Eve, the woman who is tempted to exposed, the unfair judgements and discriminatory racial and sexual stereotypes in which, the power, make be, has on people. It's no wonder, why V target the three symbols of authority: the government, the church and education institution. It makes more sense. I like the complexity that the comic, had. You truly, don't know, if V was the good guy, bad guy or just mad. It's so unlike the movie, that makes you really want to cheer for anarchists, even after the sick psychological and physical torturing, they do, against each other. I love, how V in the comics, has more moral ambiguity. Still, I can understand, why the film wanted to make V, more sympathetic than its comic book version. After all, we have to agree for the cause, in which, he fighting for, or we wouldn't have a movie. Weaving does a likable job, here. His charisma shows through his speech patterns, his philosophy, his dry sense of humor, and his flair for dramatics. All these qualities make V, watchable. One thing, that I thought, the movie does better, than the comic, was not to make him, seem like a superhero with peak-human abilities. The movie stay away from the superman drugs. No mention of LSD or Batch 5 really help the script. That's one thing, I didn't like, from the comic. However, the Matrix-like action scenes and slow-motion domino scenes, were a bit over-the top, pretentious fillers. One thing, that I felt the movie does really well, is show, the duality between V and Evey. V was created by fire, signifying destruction. While, there is Evey who is reborn by water, signifying creation. It shows that Anarchy wear two faces- both creator and destroyer. I have to say, Natalie Portman was outstanding in her role. I didn't mind, the little changes, they did, for the character. Still, V for Vendetta was a bit heavy-handed, when it comes to Evey's transformation from simpleton to cult leader. It's seem like an easy choice for her, here, than in the comics. Overall: In my opinion, the original comic will always be better, because it was influenced by Alan Moore's fears of Thatcherite Britain becoming a repressive dictatorship. While, the film version owes more to critics of the second Bush administration and its clear filmic references to human rights abuses by the US, emphasis on terrorism and Islamophobia. Still, whatever, version, you get into. Both serve, its purpose: being thought-provoking. It's a must-have.",

130,10 April 2006,pandabat,5, Did I see the same version as everyone else?,"Wow! As a lot of the comments I am seeing for this movie are very positive, I am just wondering if I have seen the same version, or cut, of the movie as everyone else seemingly has. I cannot see how this was enjoyed, as a whole, by anyone. Yes, there may have been certain scenes which certain people may have enjoyed but overall, there's little to be impressed with. The exploding buildings were fine but very reminiscent of Independence Day in that some of them just weren't real enough. The script was, well, poor (the alliterative sequence aside - alas, this too was overdone). The characters were bare types and I don't think anyone had to use much of their acting powers in orders to portray them. John Hurt barking out from a screen being a prime example. V's and Evey's relationship, such as it appeared to blossom from nowhere (""Oh you've tortured me and kept me as a prisoner, let me kiss you!), was unconvincing. The story didn't have much content either and the movie ran far too long. You found yourself waiting to see what the point of it all was and in the end discovered that there was little point at all. The only value that the movie has for me is that, perhaps, it is an attempt to bring to mainstream America the ideas and concepts of fear that have been used by US government to oppress the people of the US, to start and continue wars, to remove and ignore human rights, to add new ""big-brother"" style laws and to make the rich and powerful richer and yet more powerful, as Mr. Noam Chomsky's been saying for years.

142,24 March 2006,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,9, Is terror ever a justifiable tactic to use? And if so... what does it take for it to become that?,"I was fortunate enough to watch this on the opening night. Having returned from the cinema, just a few hours after it ended, and with the movie still fresh in my mind, I write this review. My main interest in the film was and remains that the graphic novel upon which it is based was written by Alan Moore, arguably one of the best comic writers and without a shadow of doubt one of my favorites. Allow me to address the fellow fans for a moment; a lot of the story is intact(if the conflict is shifted, with measurable loss of effect, to the current political climate, rather than Moore's original, anarchy versus government), though some is changed around to being more visual(even though it does have images, the original comic book is still that... a book. Words can convey more depth than moving visuals with few exceptions, and the transition from one medium to another, it is pointless to deny, requires some changes). However, several images are recreated to the very last detail(something I haven't seen the likes of which since Sin City, which used the comic as storyboards, something I suspect may have also been the case here, at least to a certain extent. I recognized so much. Some subplots and such are cut for length and pacing, but they did fair in keeping all that they could without it being difficult to keep track of for new viewers(I watched it with three people who had never seen a single frame of the comic, and each of them 'got it', and enjoyed it, just as I... one asked where he could get the comic itself). And I'm very happy to tell you that the famous torture sequence hasn't been removed; if my memory of the comic serves me right... is hasn't even been trimmed. The first trailer told me this, and ever since I saw it, I've been eagerly anticipating its premiere, and I don't regret hyping myself up for watching it in the least. Albeit, that trailer(and the following one, even more-so) also claimed that the film was action-packed... something one of my fellow viewers accepted as true, and expected. He didn't leave disappointed, though, merely surprised. Know, dear potential viewer and reader of this review, that this is not an 'action' film/flick... don't go to see this expecting constant fight scenes. If you watched The Matrix and all you saw were the fight scenes... don't watch this. There's considerably less action. What there is, however, is rather remarkable... it's clear that these are the people behind aforementioned film, and it's clear that they read and dig the comic, and comics in general. The visuals are breathtaking. I don't remember when I was last gripped by a film like I was by this one. The direction is quite good, although there are points where you can tell that the man in the chair has not sat there before, as well as the fact that he had strong guidance from the Wachowski brothers. The plot is excellent. The pacing is near perfect. The acting was flawless. The characters are well-written, credible and interesting. The film is very involving and intense, it pulls you in and doesn't let go until the credits roll. It's very stylish and cool. The film relies greatly on dialog(which also means that most of the humor is verbal, British... marvelous choice, if I do say so myself), much like the novel... although some things are obviously more visual than the source material. The Voice of London gets a face and V's fights get easier on the eyes(and obviously, the explosions are very much there). What I really enjoyed, while watching this movie, was that it was hardly toned down... it was almost all there. The perverseness, the 'different' human beings, and, most importantly, the message. The moral. The question that is asked, that we must consider: Is terror ever a justifiable tactic to use? And if so... what does it take for it to become that? I recommend this great piece of cinema to anyone who is willing to open their minds to the themes within(though the book contains more), and especially fans of Alan Moore, the Wachowskies and/or comic books. 9/10",

The scenes where Evey is being interrogated but it turns out to be V testing her, to help rid her of fear so that she can commit terrorist acts, is unconscionable. It's a homage in how to train a suicide bomber. I knew Ms. Portman was interested in far Left politics, I guess this is her ode to them. It's also a bigoted film in that Christianity is stereotyped in the absolute worse possible ways. The TV personality is a racists, Muslin hating homophobic and the Bishop is a pedophile. If you had of treated any other group this way their would've been protests. So this is a film that plays to an adoring constituency and will turn off anyone who isn't like minded.

146,27 March 2006,ENIGMA05,10," Power, Gentleness, even Love behind the Mystery","If you really think about it, V himself is kind of sexy. I mean you have a man who always wears the same mask but has different emotions and persona's. Even though the mask never changes, one can understand the emotions beyond the mask and really feel for the character. When he's angry you can feel it regardless of that grin, and when he's sad or upset that's visible as well. (Possible Spoilers) At the end when Evey begs him to stay and kisses the mask on the lips, you can almost feel him tremble and when he says I can't, the voice is one of a man trapped in hell because he wants to stay with her but also needs to finish what he started. When he stumbles back after the last fight and collapses in her arms, he tells her that even though he's glad its almost over, he never expected to fall in love again or rather didn't think he was capable again after the last time. Despite the same black clothes and the same wig, hat, and that Guy Fawkes mask, you can tell that he loves her with all of his heart. A heart that has been scarred with the horrors of his life, but still just before he dies you can feel him redeemed because of her. Even though this movie is packed with action its also a really high-tech future-istic love story. At first I thought that V should have let Evey see his face but than I realized that it made him who he was trying to be and others to see. It's because of that, I think made him very appealing to women; power, gentleness, and love behind the mystery. He wasn't there for evil, he was there to stop it, to bring it down, with revenge and some serious skill. All of us women, need a little V in our lives.",

161,20 March 2006,David_Frames,2, The vendetta is against the audience,"..and you might wonder what you did to deserve it if you're forced to sit through this imbecilic, pretentious candy floss. If Brazil and Nineteen Eighty-Four are the perfect fusion of botanicals and base spirit in bleak totalitarian terms then V for Vendetta is the tasteless engine lubricant that passes for gin, served in Victory Square. Ripped from the soiled pages of Alan Moore's 1989 Anti-Thatcherite fantasy, it envisions a Britain (though in the movie this is freely interchangeable with England betraying the ignorance of the screenwriters) that's been taken over by a tyrannical despotic government. All freedoms are curtailed, though sadly not the freedom to talk in long-winded sentences but we'll come back to that. 'V' is a terrorist who plans to change all this by dressing as Guy Fawkes, that other, er, champion of the oppressed masses, - hatching a plan to destroy Parliament, by now a symbol of repression and intolerance thus liberating the populous  Guido redux if you like while John Hurt, inverting his Winston Smith role, grimaces and gesticulates as the Stalinesque Chancellor who V plans to permanently deselect. I've not read the graphic novel and this is something I share with the filmmakers if the result is anything to go by. In fact so muddled are the politics, so flat the direction and so poor the performances that it feels from start to finish like the filmic equivalent of a dirty protest. Vendetta's conception is a washout in every respect. The poorly structured, badly written screenplay by the Warchowski Brothers is primarily to blame. Why are these people given so much latitude? Didn't anyone see the Matrix sequels? The brothers grim commit their own act of cine-terrorism by creating a sort of England USA where the English speak a sort of Californian-cockney. Listening to it recalls the scene from Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home is which Kirk suggests that they try to communicate with the space probe mimicking whale song. Spock points out that this would be pointless as you'd be copying the sounds not the language resulting in ""gibberish""  its as if all the dialogue in this film has been channelled through the same translation software. The brothers know some English colloquialisms but have no idea how they are naturally used in real speech. American audiences won't care of course but for the real English it will be an effort not to laugh your way through the whole thing  it'll be all you can do to stay awake. This is like grit in the eyes but sadly, it's not the worst of it. The dire-logue aside it's the total poverty of ideas that really gets to you as it drags on..and on. The government of the future has been so successful in crushing the will of the people that's it turned all Londoners into clichés who helpfully sit on their sofas and watch the telescreen all day, lapping up V's simplistic messages of dissent or alternatively they're the proles, drinking in dank pubs  looking downtrodden and fixated on drink. Yes indeed, this is very much British life as I'd imagine it to be were I from Illonois. The screenplay is incredibly wordy  very long speeches, exposition follows exposition. Those hoping for some action to liven up the proceedings or break up the dull patches will feel their heart sink into their stomach long before it crawls to its plodding climax. The worst points? There are so many but V's demented Dandy routine accounts for most  Natalie Portman sounds like a New Zealander who ever so often remembers to enunciate an English vowel (badly)  the scene in which she dresses as a school girl so tow curlingly embarrassing as to make her work on Star Wars look Oscar winning by comparison.Hugo Weaving is wasting his time as the man behind the mask as he could be played by anyone  in fact Eryol Flynn's corpse could have matched this level of performance and for Steven Fry, an intelligent man so we're told, this should be a deeply depressing episode. I'm sure the idea of playing a repressed gay man who appreciates classic literature but can't openly say so must have been a lure but my goodness, it's the febrile complex on the film's pallid, diseased face. In bonfire night terms, V for Vendetta is like a knocked off firework in an expensive looking box  once lit it doesn't go off for 2 hours and when you go to check it, the thing blows up in your face scarring you for life. One mark for the use of the Julie London song (very droll) and one mark for those dominoes but that aside this is a hideous waste of effort. The rack, noose and knife for all concerned please.",

172,21 December 2008,jboothmillard,6, V for Vendetta,"I had heard and seen many images of this film, so I was definitely going to give it a go, from writer and producer brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski (creators of The Matrix). The film begins with the capture and hanging of Guy Fawkes, and then forwards to a not too distant looking future (2038) Great Britain, in which a masked (with the face of Guy Fawke) known only as V - or later William Rookwood (Hugo Weaving) - blows up the Old Bailey building on November 5th. He warns everyone that in 364 days from that night, he will do what the real Guy Fawkes planned and blow up the Houses of Parliament. Orphan Evey (Natalie Portman) finds herself helping V escape from the authorities, and slowly falling for him. V by the way is a very enigmatic terrorist, or vigilante if you like, who uses a lot of poetry and Shakespearian dialect to get his points across. There is a point when she is ""captureD2 (and has her hair chopped off), when it was in fact V. Trying to find V are Inspector Finch (The Crying Game's Stephen Rea) and Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith), under the watch of their boss, a Big Brother type figure, Adam Sutler (John Hurt). So November 5th approaches, and Evey does come back to V, after he let her go, till the day of course, and he does sacrifice himself, before the streets are swarmed with hundreds of people in his image, and the Houses of Parliament blow up. Also starring Stephen Fry as Deitrich, Rupert Graves as Dominic, Roger Allam as Lewis Prothero, Ben Miles as Dascomb and Sinéad Cusack as Delia Surridge. V (which by the way in Roman numeral means five) is a very intriguing character, with knives and razors to slice up people in his way, and yet he speaks so poetically, you can't help but like him, and Weaving was the perfect choice. Portman does quite well with the English accent, and supporting cast members Rea, Hurt and Fry add some good depth, it is along the lines of something like A Clockwork Orange, Fight Club or Twelve Monkeys, very enigmatic with hidden messages, but a good film none-the-less.

There is violence, suspense, drama, revenge, romance, comedy, intrigue, excitement and of course, mystery of character. Most of all, this film has Chancellor Adam Sutlet (John Hurt) who embodies the unbridled and ruthless power of a brutal government. Arrayed against him is V, superbly and adroitly played by extremely talented Hugo Weaving. The story is that of a dark hero who is condemned to unspeakable torture and imprisonment returns from certain dead to strike terror into the heart of an established totalitarian system which created him. Using the facade of a dead anarchist, Wearing plays a dangerous cat and mouse game with the police and the dictator, using both special effects and a dazzling dexterity with knives.

I cant say I was too overly impressed with it either; I saw it mainly because Natalie Portman thought the project was good enough to shave her head for, and even though the last two films by the Wachowski Brothers weren't very good, the first Matrix film made it obvious that they have a flair for action sequences. The plot is based on numerous ideas, all of which focus on government. V for Vendetta is supposedly a commentary on Thatcher's Britain, and this is mixed in with ideas stemming from Guy Fawke's plot to blow up the houses of parliament, and a revolution against the Government. The ideas are mostly very good; but there's too many of them, and many of the themes get lost in a convoluted plot that mainly sees a masked marauder calling himself 'V' picking off various members of government, while finding time to plant bombs and share a tentative near romance with the angelic Evey, played by the very talented Natalie Portman.",

You need to present a really dour, Machiavellian political atmosphere, where all sense of personal freedom is removed. Where the threat of brutalities is as horrifying as the brutalities themselves. Characters with muted personalities, indicating fearful oppression, but yet moments of humanity peeking through (1984, Fahrenheit 451, Handmaid's Tale, THX 1138) and the hero should begin like all the others, no different than they are, except for a courageous ability to rebel. For as long as there is even only one defiant character, the world is saved. There hasn't been a movie like that in a long time.

The movie often changes pace, attempting to be a action film, a serious drama, a comedy, and an ""intelligent"" commentary on the dependence on government (""science fiction,"" in the sense of remarking on societal flaws). It achieves no success in any genre. The film is too mellow and the action is too spread out to be a gripping action movie. The dialogue is too cheesy and the characters not developed properly for this movie to achieve the level of a serious and meaningful drama.

The Wachowski's reputation on creating poignant, smart action packed rides preceded them. With ""Matrix"" not only did I get one of the freshest action films but one of the sharpest and deepest scripts ever written. All I can give to this movie as a word is ""pseudo"". V is a pseudo-hero, that prefers to talk and digress than commit the noble acts. James McTiegue knows how to cope with filmical elements, but that's all. V (by Hugo Weaving) doesn't relate to the audience and has no point of contact with any common human, his basis of thoughts are fragile and biased. A hero in an anarchy isn't only interesting (not on the way delivered) but unoriginal. And political. Who could move it to a higher ground? All what it tries to achieve it fails.

242,23 November 2012,robert-259-28954,9, I enjoyed this film very much.,"In fact, I'll make a prediction: THIS FILM WILL BECOME A CULT CLASSIC. Of this I have no doubt. After several viewings for friends, my most recent one on Thanksgiving day with an English friend, revealed many fascinating things about the movie that I had no prior knowledge of that I'd care to share. For example, the protagonist, Guy Fawkes, was an actual person, a revolutionary who attempted to blow up Parliament when he believed the government had become too corrupt, in the 1600's. In fact, the Brits still celebrate the occasion on November the fifth, the same date in the film, and apparently, their own fourth of July. Most of the great character actors in the piece were top British actors as well, including a brief but superbly nuanced role of the female doctor, portrayed by Sinead Cusack, who is actually Jeremy Irons' wife, another interesting point of interest. I enjoyed the diminutive, waifish, Natalie Portman in the main role, her English accent learned in just two weeks, and ""one of the best"" in my English guest's opinion, adding another interesting note. But far and away, in my opinion this film belonged to the wonderful Hugo Weaving, who actually replaced the original star, who while into the sixth week of shooting, had to quit the picture due his growing claustrophobia in wearing the iconic mask in each and every scene. Hugo, who had to originally turn down the plum role because of previous commitments, then had the auspicious good luck of stepping into the role after that. Stephen Rea turns in another terrific and understated performance as the long suffering head investigator. And did I mention the WONDERFUL, EXQUISITE AND SPECTACULAR acting turn provided by Stephen Fry?? Being a gay AND an atheist, he brings so much of his real life history into the role that the performance never fails to move me. This man is a deep soul, and his intelligence and sensitive portrayals illuminate each and every role he's involved in. Casting him for this part was a decision of pure genius. My only nitpick of the entire film was it's length, which I felt was a little excessive. But a fine movie nonetheless, with kudos to James McTeigue.",

261,9 November 2019,jayjaycee,7, You don't have to cover your face to wear a mask...,"""V For Vendetta"" is a 2005 comic book drama directed by James McTeigue starring Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman. As it is sort of a holiday for cinephiles and most of us tend to rewatch it on that particular date, I tried to give it a first time watch myself this year, but unfortunately I had to postpone it due to a punk concert I've visited instead, but now - a few days later - coincidentally on a date that bears a tremendous political importance in Germany, I finally got to see it. So I think this will make it up to it. First of all, this film shows us a dystopian society that has a lot in common with several classic novels. Unfortunately though, there's not enough to it that makes it distinct, it's not as well elaborated as I hoped it would be. There's no explanation of why it happened and doesn't offer any chance to learn about the circumstances. But that's only a minor flaw. What I think was excellently done is the dialogue and the meaning behind every single line. It's so tremendously intelligent and thought provoking and the choice of words is only superb. It effects the viewer to intensively think about the own society one lives in. Furthermore, it's alarming to see how the corrupt government misuses the media for their own, misleading interests and how it is close to it's real-life counterpart at times. It's actually sad to say that the reality doesn't always differ from what is depicted in here. Next to this, the sensational cast really shows that it has top-class actors and actresses in its ranks, especially Portman and Weaving (is it even him, though? Serious question) and it's stylishly filmed and captured the essence of the graphic novel very well. It doesn't recoil to tackle highly inconvenient topics, such as propaganda, mistreatment of human beings and media and the abuse of power. Also, it offers a lot of highly quotable exclamations, but there's still one big issue that prevents it from being a masterpiece: The narrative structure. The film is way to long in general and it has too many scenes that should have been either cut or shortened, but as they are still in the final cut, they perturb the storytelling tremendously. The absolutely well worded scenes and following actions would have had way more impact and would have striked the chord way more unpleasantly if it didn't have so many lengths in it. The buildup of tension was immensely disrupted my multiple scenes that simply lasted to long and, as harsh as it sound, made the tension vanish on several occasions. Each time it seemed to reach the perfect level again, it failed to do so. After seeing this happen a few time it was frustrating. The final act though redeemed the overall unbalanced second act and showed the brilliance it had in the first act. Additionally, it didn't reach the emotional depth I was hoping to see, but that's just mentioned casually. All in all, this dystopian drama knows what it stands for and offers the right approaches, appropriate performances and twists and extremely intelligent lines, besides the disastrous storytelling it's an enjoyable and important flick that makes us reflect our own view to our own society. It's no masterpiece and it's such a pity that it had so much potential to be one.",

This film did not make the cut; we came out laughing wondering what a waste of time. Overall, I think we thought it was a 4 of 10. I give it lower since it is a waste of Natalie Portman, John Hurt, and Stephen Rhea and lots of money. What makes it silly is that it takes a neo-Nazi totalitarian regime and gives it credibility in a future-England-like society. I can't see that happening. John Hurt was easy to see through as an evil prime minister. But can millions of people be that naive? Perhaps in a less sophisticated or educated society or a third world culture. But almost definitely not a modern western society. Terrorism conducted by V in his mask becomes justified to combat Nazi-like totalitarianism. OK, but conducted by a man who wears a silly mask? Is that truly credible? Brazil and 1984 (also with John Hurt) are far better films (and still not great films). Furthermore, the political monologues by V were not inspiring. It was like watching a clown trying to recite a serious Hamlet monologue. Hard to take serious. Even the cinematography is not particularly great but at least a bit atmospheric. The ending was downright silly as the climax builds up to a date to remember so the movie claims...but perhaps a date to forget if you watch the end...plain dumb.

Or maybe it should be called L for Leave the Theatre Before the Credits Roll for all the good it is. Lame comic remake about finality. Hugo Weaving dons a smiley mask and enacts vengeance upon a government. He receives assistance from Natalie Portman whom he rescues from being mugged. Premise is rushed but structure is detailed due to Portman's surfacing back story. Ending is the typical violence. Director James McTeigue rushes his shots as if trying to get the film shot in record time. Weaving is compelling enough as V to render a decent performance as he fights against government to the point of sacrifice. Natalie Portman is given the best section of the film. After her initial rescue she is put through numerous acts of torture where her background is revealed through flashbacks. She will ultimately become the film's true stronghold. Stephen Rea plays a detective in what becomes rather standard writing of typical investigation jargon. John Hurt plays a villain who shouts into a screen as if desperately yearning a placement on another film set. In the end this is a well made comic book adaptation that only partially works.

But the Wachowski brothers created a film with multiple levels of meaning that the trailers failed to even begin decoding. It is set more than 20 years in the future in England where a masked man attempts to change the world. There are elements of Hitler's rise to power through the induction of fear, the mystery of Phantom of the Opera, but most importantly an inquisitive protagonist similar to the one found in Orwell's 1984. The theme is evident: People should not be afraid of their government; the government should be afraid of the people. Through ingenious acts of deception and illusion, the main character, V, shapes Evie, a girl he rescues in an alleyway. As a common woman, she represents all of society. She has the ability to incite change but is unsure how to go about it. V's acts come across as horrendous to some, but for those attentively listening to his rationale, seems so logical.

Alan Moore has disassociated himself from this film, and with good reason. A few of the character names are the same, and a couple of sequences bear a slight resemblance -- but that's it. The fire, the passion, the heart and soul that so infused the novel is completely absent. The screen story was already written, and the filmmakers ignored it, rewriting whole scenes, cutting out others, eliminating a good 75% of the story's power, meaning and resonance. The characters are shallow, empty husks of their original selves, and the pacing is abominable. Nowhere in this superficial yawnfest is the true understanding of revolution made manifest. Nowhere is the audience truly brought in to and made a part of V's tormented motivations or Evey's harrowing journey.

Terribly disfigured, he wears a Guy Fawkes mask at all times. Wronged long ago by a government agency, he is plotting his revenge. Evidentally, the United States is in chaos, having been a victim of nuclear warfare and plague. Some devious leaders of Britain vowed not to let that happen there. So, through deception and fear, a small party grabbed power. The Big Commissioner, Alan (John Hurt) rules with an iron fist and an iron heart. The curfew is early each evening, the telly has him giving speech after speech and he has a secret police called The Fingermen to enforce his rules. The chief of police, Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith) is just as evil. Also working for the government is Finch (Stephen Rea) who works in investigation. One night, Evey (Natalie Portman), a television news production underling, is supposed to pay an after-dark visit to one of the top telly brass. But, The Fingermen capture her and attempt a rape. V comes to her rescue, knocking off the bad guys with incredible weapon skills and martial arts. Very grateful, Evey agrees to go hear some music with V. BUT, what she thinks is a concert turns about to be a rooftop view to a demolition, set to the 1812 overture. After a major London building is destroyed, V comes on the telly to urge his fellow citizens to join him, one year from now, on Guy Fawkes Day to bring down the oppressive regime. Whew! At once, all of the leaders are out to capture him and thwart his plots. But, from an underground abode, he starts knocking off some of the rulers. Evey, fearful at first, comes to admire him greatly. But, since he is just one man, can he free the country from its totalitarian state? Its so unlikely yet V keeps winning. However, soon Evey is captured and undergoes torture to induce her to reveal V's residence. Will she break? Will V's brave efforts be for naught? How can I describe such a sensational movie as this? Yes, its quite violent in parts and owes a debt of gratitude to Orwell's 1984, The Count of Monte Cristo and other sources. Once a graphic novel, it also grapples with huge moral issues, such as to overthrow a corrupt nation, does the fighter become corrupt as well? Portman, complete with a British accent, is beautiful and touching while Weaving, with only a voice, does an incredible job as the title character. Hurt, too, is amazing, while Rea, Pigott-Smith, and all, all of the other cast members are admirable indeed.

On the bright side, it also makes for a captivating experience. The film is set in the not-so-distant future in Great Britain, a country dominated by a fascist government under the head of the Norsefire Party, following the destruction of the United States from a civil war and viral pandemic from a disease known as St. Mary. Sporting a wig and a mask resembling the notorious Guy Fawkes, anarchist freedom fighter under the name V (played by Hugo Weaving) chooses to rebel against the government by posing as a vigilante and fighting against the ones who support the fascist government.

What if every citizen gave into his control out of fear? What if one man's tortured past was the only way that he could see the totalitarian rule as a bad thing? And what if this one man was the only person that could change the world for the better? Beautifully filmed and magnificent dialogue moves this movie along. An underground cavern filled with priceless works of art that chronicles the world's history.

I was particularly impressed with Hugo Weaving's performance, despite the wig and the mask, he managed to portray the pain and rage that was deep inside the character. It was a pity that the movie could not show more of the injustices and oppression that the people were suffering. The graphic novel really showed how bad things were in this dystopian future of England, but the movie seemed to just skim over this. What thrilled me though, was the letter from Valerie, I was hoping that the movie would do this justice and not just skim over it as unimportant.

So us moronic viewers have to sit through a pile of overly-articulate monologue's and then right after the questioning of them by the ""Keanu"" character played in this film by Natalee Portman (who to her best efforts tries to do a good job.) So beyond ruining some great Alan Moore writing, the brothers decide to let some assistant director take the helm of the director's chair. The opening sequence was like a poorly made Bruckhiemer movie (as well as the ending sequence). Laced with melodramatic musical score and some editor who loves to cut, never letting us look at a single shot for more than 1 second.

But the Brothers W let us down with a half-baked screenplay and the more you think about this movie the less good it is. Consider, in particular, V's ability to circumvent an enormous security infrastructure to assassinate top level officials in their homes at will, hijack a government train, acquire and distribute a half million Guy Fawkes masks, and stock his personal museum sanctuary with art treasures. How he does any of these things is seldom shown, and more often than not he simply tells us that he has done them.

Honestly, how many times is the 1984/big brother theme going to be rehashed? It is a great book and all but someone needs to think of a new dystopian premise. The other one that has been done to death is the plague that either kills people or turns them into monsters.

385,21 March 2006,supertom-3,9," Brilliant movie, far better than the Matrix sequels!!","The science fiction genre is very much a mixed bag. The success rate is minimal and generally the mega budgeted films fall flat and lifeless. V For Vendetta however falls under the mid budget range category and as such it's not a bloated attempt at marketable science fiction excess. This isn't like Bays shallow film The Island, or the disappointingly tame vision from Alex Proyas in I Robot, whose previous science fiction film was the moderately budgeted and superb Dark City. Essentially the producer pressure of these over-hyped and overpriced rip-offs don't have the love and attention given to films not green=lit with hundreds of millions. For example the first Matrix film, the most influential of it's genre since Terminator 2 (a rare hundred mill plus success!) was infinitely more engrossing than it's lifeless sequels. With endless resources at hand and the ability to go extreme, the Wachowski's two sequels attempted to cram our heads with philosophy and religious connotation that was more subtly fed to the audience in the original. The films survived only by the impressive effects and huge action scenes, and that goes for other similarly gigantic sci-fi epics. The films shot under that 100 mill bracket show more ingenuity and more heart, and mostly more originality. Even right down to ultra low budget there have been great films, like Cube, far more enjoyably thought provoking than the now boring Matrix sequels that completely lack the original films repeat value.",

They close the London Underground or at least they think. V is the mysterious guy in a mask who captures and releases Evie played by Natalie Portman. Ironic that they filmed this movie in Germany of all places but that's another story.

I've read that the story is based on a graphic novel that I am not familiar with and so I probably missed many of the movie's references. The story concerned a revolutionary, V, in his battle with a future totalitarian English government. V enlists the help of young women, Evey, played by Natalie Portman, who he rescues from some predatory, corrupt police officials. Much of the story revolves around Evey and her relationship with the V character. Telling more would ruin the story. There's quite a bit of violence in the movie and towards the end there's a sequence of choreographed violence that I found to be too much though maybe those familiar with the graphic novel expected this kind of money shot. The movie featured many fine actors including John Hurt, Stephen Fry, Stephen Rea, Tim Pigott-Smith and others. Natalie Portman was very good, in fact she was a surprise delight of the movie. I thought she was better looking after being shorn. She's a babe. The cinematography was good and the story was complex enough to hold your interest.

V echoes back to 1984 (the movie) and even Phantom of the Opera. The introduction of a stylish mask hero and a female heroine subjected to vile torture with a twist makes for compelling film-making. Yet for all the heroics, consistent script, the exaggerated and graphic novel appeal is also its distraction. Unlike 1984, V doesn't have that believability component.

I am going start by saying that the character of V played brilliantly by Hugo Weaving is one of those characters that will be remembered and is an instance classic. This in truth is 1 of my favourite Natalie Portman performances, she is just so full of determination and curiosity and it's infectious. The scene where V and Evey first meat is truly tremendous. V saves Evey from some men trying to rough her up, she does hold her ground, V shows off some kick ass moves and a very versatile vocabulary (see what I did there). One of favourite things about V is he is an antihero yet he still views himself as a sort of freedom fighter who is standing up for the opposing government. The reason why I love this movie so much is the true determination to do what is right and the casualties that had to happen. V was a broken body but a free soul that wanted to make a difference and he did so. Was everything planned, I don't know but all I know is this movie is a must watch and truly is amazing",
409,5 September 2006,mitchabramson,7," They get it , and politically miss it","It starts off with a testimony to the importance of free speech; i.e. IDEAS. The movie purports to show the power of that basis for all freedoms: the freedom to speak your ideas, your insights, your criticisms. Since these freedoms have been suppressed by a conservative-style government (anti-immigrant, homophobic, anti-Islamic, etc.) , kept afloat with the help of servile media, the answer lies in ""V"" as freedom-fighter. So far, so good - and it IS good, but where Hollywood (always) turns the blind eye is that IN REALITY, it is on the nation's liberal left campuses for example, that any opinion other than that of say, gay activists, is condemned as homophobic; any opinion contrary to unlimited abortion-on-demand is seen as anti-feminist; to oppose racial quotas is to be seen as ""racist."" The media is continually in the hip pocket of the left, and the IDEA of free-speech that ""V"" is championing are the very ideas liberal left-wingers will literally not allow to be spoken on campuses, in most Hollywood movies as well as the mainstream press. Having lived 4 years in the mideast, let me say it is obvious neither the Wachowski brothers, the director or the screenwriter had actually read the Koran, which they make a point of protecting from the angry xenophobic gov't. Had they done so, they would have seen that everything ""V"" id FOR is OPPOSED in a book that would suit well on any fascist's shelf. Mein Kamp would have been the same choice.

Of course we can think of 1984 and Big Brother who has become the High Chancellor. Of course we can think of Zorro or Batman who have become V. Of course we can think of so many other films (try The Running Man for instance, or Total Recall) that have been dealing with the end of a world turned into an absolutely totalitarian dictatorship. The apocalypse of another apocalypse, an apocalyptic end to a catastrophic apocalypse. So what does this film bring us that is new ? A touch of optimism. A real change is possible when and only when the people starts moving, and the people will move if you provide them with some hope by destroying a few symbolic milestones in their everyday political landscape. Optimistic. And imagine the armed forces of such an absolutely fascistic regime not firing at the crowd that is coming unarmed and numerous. Optimistic. Is it good to have a little dose of optimism from time to time ? Maybe. Yet the film is interesting and both thrilling and entertaining. But it does not provide us with any real belief that this may happen in our world. Fascism can take over but it is always  today  in mild forms though the deeper nature is brutal and ruthless : they prefer famishing and starving someone through economic means to sending them to any concentration camp. But to revive Guy Fawkes is a real fine idea. He is so British, so English, so cute and quaint. Guy Fawkes is not even a skeleton in the British cupboard, or cabinet if your prefer.

The ideology of naziism having anything to do with the Christian Right is a gross distortion of historical realities, as naziism/fascism actually worshiped the ancient Germanic deity Odin - and praised the ancient Roman system as perfect.

He manages to convey all the emotions and draw out the audiences sympathy and outrage with only his voice and movements. Natalie Portman does a fine job as Evie from her characters shock to her fear and ultimately her resolve. The story is an excellent warning about giving too much power to the government and allowing fear to guide politics. The action sequences are beautifully done but not over-done as in many movies these days.

442,3 August 2006,Sir_James_Spensley,10, Magnificent!,"I was astounded by this Movie. Really. I say that because, after Reloaded and Revolution (which disappointed me even more than I expected), I used to think the Wachowski Bros had cheated us all with the Matrix first (and only, I might add) chapter, and that the real dimension of their talent was the one we had the luck to ""appreciate"" with Assassins (which, IMHO, is going to be remembered as one of worst movies ever). So, although (or should I say ""since"") I'm a HUGE fan of Alan Moore's comic, I have to admit that I was a little skeptical. What can I say? I don't know whether I was wrong about the authors or not (who cares, anyway?), but this is a surprisingly TERRIFIC movie and I can't wait for the day the DVD shall be released in Italy! Good acting (Natalie Portman is one of the best young actresses in the biz, only Scarlett Johansson could be reasonably compared to her) and, most of all, a Great Screenplay (but maybe we should thank Alan Moore for this) make this one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, no doubt about it. Not mentioning some typically brilliant genius idea, such as John Hurt playing the right-winger chancellor (a homage to Michael Radford's ""1984"", I guess). I realized that what I was seeing was a work of art right from the beginning, but the more time passed by, the higher the pleasure. I think that one of most frequent misconception about this movie could concern the genre it belongs to. Well, in my opinion, this is not an action movie. Or better yet, this isn't JUST an action movie, and this is its strong card. X-men is an action movie. Superman returns is an action movie. V for vendetta is much more. It's not just the story of a guy with a mask who gets bored of all those Nazi bullshit and goes berserk, kicking asses and blowing up buildings. It is a wonderful representation of emotions, feelings, situations and characters in a well-balanced mix of action, dialogues and poetry and, most important thing, the plot is not so far from being a realistic picture of the world we're currently living in (at least, some part of it). This movie is a perfect mix between Orwell, Edmond Rostand's Cyrano (well, just a little bit angry) and the Matrix, played by really good actors and based on one of greatest graphic novels ever.

That's all fine and good, but to make the protagonists likewise hypocrites by having them ""even things up"" through murder, demolition, rendition and general anarchy and selling it as empowerment of the masses is inane. It cancels out any validity of the argument. Why do we respect Martin Luther King as opposed to people like the Black Panthers? What have the masses learned from V but to behave just as the oppressors have. They do ""overcome their fear"" (which is an important message) but just as Evey had through her own ""rendition"" - you have to ask yourself 'at what price?' The last scene, in this sense, does not equate to a peaceful overtaking of the government - the masses simply show their support for another flavor of terrorist and enjoy the power vacuum his assassinations (although arguably justifiable) have created. V does realize that he is a ""monster"", but such a revelation coming from an individual, who has calmly declared his willingness to kill earlier, simply comes across as less of a realization and more of a simple letting go of that monster because the deed was done.",
444,15 August 2006,r0cko723,3, Mister Anderson . . . you disappoint me.,"In his review of this overblown and disappointing shovel-ful of lard-hype (I say disappointing, because the writer/producers' ""The Matrix"" was wonderfully inventive and character-driven), my man Roger Ebert asks: ""Is this movie a parable about 2006, a cautionary tale or a pure fantasy?"" PUHLEEEEEASE. C'mon, man. I mean, how overt does a roll of celluloid have to be before you give it the sledgehammer award for heavy-handedness? For me, this film was a huge disappointment because my expectations were so high, based on how much I enjoyed ""The Matrix"" and ""Bound,"" both written and directed by the Brothers W, who screen-scripted ""V"" and evidently left their second man James McTeigue hanging out to dry as director on this one. There was nothing subtle about the contrived and preachy analogies between the totalitarian bad guys in ""V"" and the targeted real-world counterparts and conservative ideologies in the West. The problem with the politically motivated axe-grinding that shows up in films like ""V"" is that any efforts to produce a more encompassing, honest, and human depiction of characters and events are subsumed to the desire to propagandize and preach. With the passage of time, a film like ""V"" becomes more trite and embarrassing, while a film like ""The Matrix"" becomes more established and entrenched in our hearts and minds. Artists who eschew that which is most universal and central to the human condition in order to rail against personalities/parties/fill-in-the-blank of the ephemeral and always shifting political landscape give away so very much to preach points that are already tiring and lame by the time they hit the screen.

While 'V For Vendetta (2005)' certainly has its faults, especially in its rather slow second act - not to mention the fact that Natalie Portman's English accent is almost criminal, this is an entertaining and, at times, thought-provoking piece that manages to maintain a decent distance from its somewhat touchy subject matter and to exist purely as a piece of fairly intelligent but equally enjoyable filmmaking. 7/10",

Mockery of Christianity and its figures. Most of all, our hero. With a theatrical flair and classically educated wit, he emerges as a savior against oppression. His offering? Anarchy. Chaos. All of this he couches in terms like ""opportunity"" and ""hope"", but what hope does anarchy ever offer beyond destruction and disorder? Never does our hero offer his vision for a brighter tomorrow.

Their first encounter shows V explaining his plan to blow up the Houses of Parliament in exactly 12 months time on the 5th November. V demonstrates his point by blowing up another building in London. V then ups the ante by hi-jacking BTN (British Television Network) and outlines his plans for the 5th November to the entire nation. Upon hearing this, the police swarm the building and come close to arresting V, but Evey intervenes, but gets knocked unconscious as a result. V rescues her again and as Evey is deemed to be allied with V she finds herself on the run from both the government and the police with V.",

Natalie Portman's rotten British accent is still pretty tough to get past, but with that exception the roles were almost perfectly cast and the themes present in Alan Moore's graphic novel are still as appropriate today as they were in the early '80s. Although I spotted a few surprising omissions from the original story, the recent translation of another Moore story, Watchmen, has taught me that many times a direct panel-for-panel recreation isn't the right way to go, either.

V for Vendetta is spot-on regarding the dark years of the United States: 2001 to 2009. Although set in England, it covers all the bases: using religion to suppress any objective thinking in the masses; widespread surveillance of individual citizens; rampant misinformation and lies from the government; faux terrorism and fear used by the government to control its own people; and the irony that the powers that be actually profit directly from the result of said terrorism (in this case, it's pharmaceutical companies profiting from bio-terror attacks, rather than oil companies benefiting from Middle East turmoil). And finally, the film reminds us that it's the duty of all us to oppose tyranny, and governments like those of George W. Bush.

Written by the brothers and directed by James McTeigue 'V' is an exercise in restraint on the part of both parties and it pays off. The marque of The Matrix was its gratuitous use of CGI and its incontinent level of nouveau-hippy cod philosophical clap-trap; thankfully 'V' relies on neither of these schlock crutches. The CGI, in terms of fight scenes, is kept to a minimum and the dialogue is fairly crisp and, overall, 'V' has a similar tone to Alex Proyas's 'Dark City' on which Mc Teigue was second assistant director.",

Who by the way, wasn't the worst thing in this movie, which is kind of scary considering what an awful actress she has turned out to be. The movie comes across as little more than an ""anarchy sticker"" stuck on the bottom of some suburban punks' skateboard to look cool. Just like the suburban punk, the Wachowskis don't really believe in what they are displaying, they're just doing it to look cool. While ""V"" is completely unfaithful to comic book it was based upon, that is hardly its biggest crime. Come to think of it, compared to majority of this flicks offenses its little more than petty theft. ""V for Vendetta"" is remembered less for being a great comic book and more for being the work of a great comic book writer; Alan Moore. While nowhere near as good a book as his prior comics that were turned into films (""From Hell"" and ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen""), ""V"" does follow in suit as a yet another terrible and mishandled film based on Moore's writing. While nobody would consider the Wachowski brothers to be more than glorified video game creators, I was actually curious as to how they would handle adapting a script for a book overflowing with dialogue and light on flashy graphics. Where as the ""Matrix"" films are completely style over substance, the graphic novel ""V for Vendetta"" has countless scenes devoid of action or explosions but full of rich dialogue and character evolution. Unfortunately the brothers Wachowski, along with their partner in crime director James McTeigue screw it up so badly that if this film were ever shown in a football stadium, it could qualify as the longest fumble in NFL history. For a film that's supposed to be coated in rebellion and anarchy McTeigue and the Wachowski's never really give you a reason to believe in the terrorist hero V or his attacks on Parliament. Instead of giving you emotional and character driven reasons to come to conclusions on the cast, McTeigue and company visually shove it down your throat. You know John Hurt is bad because he's on a giant screen with huge black pupils (to show he's evil, cant you see how evil that is?) and that Portman is good because she is attractive and V is good because he causes explosions and painfully goes out of his way to attempt to illicit laughter from the audience. Not a single character in this has an ounce of reality to them let alone passion for anything going on around them. And why didn't they rerecord weaving's voice; half of V's dialogue is completely muffled due to the mask. Bloated, self important and without any meaning is all you have to remember about the 5th of November.",

Even as a teenager I saw in it what it was expressing, so I'd revisit the film from time to time for my own sake because there are some valuable things laced within it's screenplay. It was sorta silly and sloppily put together I agree with some reviews but the thing for myself, the more I rewatched it..... the less I critiqued the little stuff the less I looked at it as a goofy messy film in spite of all its historical role play or Shakespeare's lingo. The more I sat down and actually watched the film listened to the stories wrapped with stories within it..... the more I began to appreciate the entire film. The more I began to understand that this film has it all literally, it's not trying to be something it's not people. It's trying to help us as the audience. It has the corruption the intrigue the murder the lies the way the people just idly stand by because they the people KNOW who's fault it is that put them into this mess..... and you all think a typical answer *Oh well it's the big bad government that has the citizens the people locked up and stripped of their individual rights blah blah blah*...... Nope I'm sorry if that's all YOU see within this film than I guess it's intricacies will be lost on you. The more I watched this film the more I had this glorious feeling, sure it's got the scared heroine who gets freed from her own fears blah blah blah with the addition of the freedom fighter himself called V who is all mystic and bad ass.

510,24 March 2006,wizard42,9, Great acting,"Well, this movie was far better then I thought it would be. Having not liked the Matrix trilogy I went into this movie thinking that I would at best find it a good action flick. I was very surprised by the film. It helped that the Wachowski's did not direct it, as they aren't very good with actors. Hugo Weaving gives a brilliant nuanced performance behind a non-moving plastic mask. Limited to only his voice, and body movements to express the thoughts and feelings of his character, he allows us to see the tortured soul that is the protagonist of the story. We feel his pain, his love, and his sadness, all without seeing his face. This truly is an Oscar worthy performance, although I doubt he'll even be nominated given the type of movie this is, and when it has been released. Natalie Portman is equally strong. I always knew she was a good actress, despite the Star Wars trilogy where her performance varied mostly because of horrible directing and an uneven script. But given a good script and a meaty role she shines, and this movie is not exception. The vulnerability of her character, and her struggle to overcome her fear, and be truly free, is portrayed with remarkable skill. The rest of the cast is solid, with Stephen Rea giving a particularly good performance. The only problem is there is no depth to the villainous Chancellor, or for that matter in any of the bad guys. While we get a deep understanding of the protagonists, we only get a superficial rendering of the villains. The cinematography, is gorgeous, with some great stunt and special effects work. The movie moves along at a good clip, and I was surprised at how long it was, it did not seem like I had been in the theater for two and a half hours. This must be attributed to the directing, and editing, which keep the movie humming along, with no real slow moments. Yes, there is the requisite comic book violence, and you must suspend disbelief fairly often, but the movie is truly worth the time and lots of fun. As noted, I was surprised at just how good a film this is, and it is the actors along with very good directing that makes this film so good.",

This plot succeeds because of V's bravery in the face of oppression, and is supported by society's refusal to take it anymore. Society's rise to arms is demonstrated by two internal plots: that of Evey's growing bravery to the point of being willing to die to protect her freedom and that of the inspector general refusing to carry out orders for an oppressive government.

Shame on the award-givers for passing this over. England (certainly not Britain, as England here seems to have gone UDI on the rest of the UK) presented as a totalitarian state has engendered comparisons with Orwell's 1984, but this is much more akin to Animal Farm; it is a parable of the consequences of human failing and inaction on a societal scale, and the possibility of redemption for an individual. The filmmakers make brave choices - let the dialogue race ahead, don't ever show what is behind the mask. Is it churlish to point out one or two missed beats? Stephen Fry's character worked too hard to disguise his true nature, and was too canny in his dealings with the regime, to not realise the repercussions that would ensue from his satirical TV sketch. That episode served merely to propel Evey back to V. The resurrection of some characters for the mass discarding of the masks at the end was also a little bit too Brechtian for my tastes. Not perfect then, but damn close. V for Vendetta will move you to tears and make you ponder just how much England has really 'progressed' since 1605. England prevails?",

517,5 May 2007,SirianRue,6, Shallow,"You might be wondering why I called this movie shallow. It feeds the egos of all those blind rebels who think, ""finally a movie that expresses how I feel!"" But the thing is, there is no substance to the movie and frankly no substance to those who take on V's attitude against corrupt leaders. He's so victimy in this, and what he puts the girl through is just a glorified brainwashing. This feeling like you are being trapped and want everyone to know that feeling and lash out against those who caused it is stereotypical narcissism. People who like this movie don't know what freedom is. This is a movie for people who are too lazy to understand the government/control paradox and are too angry to go about it in any sort of intelligent manner. These people are just angry and blame ""the President"" or the ""Prime Minister"" for being the source of all their problems when it's that shallow mindedness that got them fooled into the situation they are currently fighting against. This is what happens when people don't wake up to themselves and can't see beyond what they hear in school or see on television. This is a movie for the ignorant rebel, a crybaby with victim written all over him. Fighting against themselves more than ""the cause"" which for them is only a product of their own sickness. So cheer on for V, the deluded idiot who knifes the president in a glorified ejaculation. Step in line, stand up to the cookie cutter, and enjoy an imaginative expression of what goes on in the minds of people who have too much anger, no understanding and rely on the BS they see and here around them to authenticate their moody victim attitude and want a movie that provides the illusion that there is wisdom behind their meaningless life.",

522,20 June 2006,hnapel,10, Meticulous consistency in a both physically and intellectually balanced plot.,"The reason this movie qualifies as a masterpiece can be attributed for a large part to its meticulous consistency in the details of the plot. Some will only be noticed if seen more than once, for example such small details as the scratch wound on Eveys forehead, how it gradually heals, the way in which Evey hides under the bed (and someone is seen dragged away as viewed from underneath it in a similar fashion) or when the woman in the TV broadcast does NOT blink when seen in another bulletin (and consequently must be speaking the truth). In other parallels (Evey raising her arms in the rain similar as to when V escaped Larkhill in fire) we are clearly guided by flashbacks, but that is justified as it strengthens the message to be conveyed. Some other comparisons are in fact morbidly hilarious if you come to think of them: V saying the forbidden art he keeps is least of his problems while Gordon Dietrich argues the other way around when also hiding Evey (and to his peril is proved ultimately right). V never taking off his mask may be perceived as annoying, but what else would the story have turned into, a happy ending 'as only celluloid can deliver' ? And it is also clearly explained by V himself in his overly elaborate manner; he's burnt, you've seen his hands and the rest is left to the imagination, again consistency.",

Though he was masked the entire film, it was still easy to see his emotions and really feel what he was feeling. You know you have a great character when this happens.

I was a bit skeptical of her being in this at first, but she quickly made me over come that and stunned me on screen with one of her best performances.

Heavy with intrigue and political satire, its themes of corruption and Orwellian paranoia are balanced with exciting action set pieces and beautifully choreographed melee from Hugo Weaving's V. V for Vendetta is a strikingly visual masterpiece, raising timelessly relevant morals and lessons around the nature of government and the power of words. Remember, remember the fifth of November.",

532,17 March 2006,richard_conrad,4," ""Bollocks!""","This film was entertaining, but it was also agonizing because it was so much worse than it could have been. If you're willing to turn off your mind, perhaps you won't be bothered by the preaching about totalitarian governments. Or the fact that the script feels like it was authored by a committee of writers, each one wanting to add their own elements that pull this movie in about fifteen different directions with no cohesive core other than politically motivated violence. This movie tries to be way too much, and in doing so it is simply not plausible. I can imagine how the scriptwriting went: -- ""Hey! Let's go off on a tangent about lesbians."" ""Great idea!"" (High-fives are exchanged.) ""Let's talk about viruses for awhile."" ""Yeah! And what if our masked hero is great at cooking toast and eggs with real butter. Let's show that several times!"" ""Excellent!"" ----- You get the idea. It was like Zorro (with 'V' instead of 'Z') meets Batman Begins, with some not-so-subtle political undertones, lots of shouting, and a script that wastes the talents of Natalie Portman. And despite all the heavy-handed symbolism and shouting, you're left wondering what the point was. This film just doesn't sit well with me. I wouldn't recommend it except to people who are easily amused by typical cinematic trash. You know who you are. Or people who just love hearing the word ""bollocks"".",

V is also futuristic but no in the way the Matrix was. I am so enthralled with the movie that I have chosen it as my last topic speech in my college Communocations class. I think that it is high time to address some harsh topics of the past and present so that people understand why present day is what it is. V is the man! I thik that more people should go and see this movie. If you haven't read the graphic novel on V please do. It is very good and it will tell you more of V's story. I give a 10 to V for thought and good old action. Go V.,
536,27 March 2006,nethlyn,9, Never read the graphic novels and loved this film,"I watched this after seeing The Hills Have Eyes Remake, but V delivered a very different type of blow to the brain! I have never read the original graphic novel so I was watching it purely to see how well the Wachowskis could move on after The Matrix. The answer? Considering the Matrix was seven years ago this was great. I don't know why fans of the graphic novel are so hacked off, if a lot more people like me will now go and buy the book. IF it's true that V takes off his mask in the comic, I'm glad they made that change in the film so that we never see him. It boosts Hugo Weaving's performance as does the lesser amount of action in this film vs The Matrix movies - then again this is set in a fictionalised version of a real place, where even in spite of the bombings and shooting of 2005, it would've been an unrealistic distraction to have as much action as an American-set film.",

Directed by a rather not-so-popular director James McTeigue, V for vendetta, portrays a single man's effort to battle the totalitarian government of his time. Combined with dazzling visuals, (those that resemble that of the matrix trilogy) V for vendetta portrays the theme of persistence and devotion throughout the film and does it extremely well. The actors, as well, play their roles so well that viewers might confuse the protagonist to the antagonist. We see this masked man in a killing spree. Yet his background leads us to sympathizing with him. And the dogma of the government makes even the cruelest and goriest measures taken by the masked rebel just.",

Today however, when it's obvious that fascism is quickly gaining momentum in the U.S., followed by other countries like UK, this movie has too many parallels to the reality that can't be ignored. Looking from this angle, the movie plays very negative role, and its message plays for the evil party. It's actually 100% American way: people living under fascistic regime don't really need to do anything. Someone will promptly come over to the rescue, and he will crash the regime using few karate kicks and few explosions. No need to unite, no need to organize, to struggle, no need for revolutionary media, or any other effort or risk. In the right time, everyone will be given a mask to conveniently hide the identity, in case things go wrong; then, somehow, everyone will be on the street, without any visible organizational effort; then couple of explosions, and the regime will crash.

The film was finished in the late part of 2004 and was due for a British release around the time of the London bombings in July 2005, but the distributors decided that the film was too provocative to release after so many people had lost their lives to 'terrorism' in the capital city where the film takes place. I can understand their decision, the film's views of London being destroyed by a bombing campaign were all too real to those of us who lived through the 70's,80's and 90's in London when the IRA were carrying out bombing attacks. But on the other hand, the narrative of the film is also true of London today. Cameras are everywhere, our Police force is being militarised and we are always told that 'terrorism' is to blame.....V is a hero not a villain, he is angry and frustrated at the way the World has gone, war, pestilence and death surround him and he finally fights back in the most spectacular fashion.

589,20 October 2008,christian_gil88,9, Superbly crafted and exciting drama of a bleak possible future,"Great Britain in the not too distant future. From the beginning of the film we are led to believe that the USA has collapsed, due to a plague and ensuing chaos and that the UK has become a totalitarian, repressive state. A combination of Hitlers's Third Reich and George Orwell's 1984. Terrifyingly realistic. (The character played implacably by John Hurt is the 'Chancellor', Adam Sutler  the references are obvious.) The story starts with a young woman being waylaid on the street at night, defying the curfew in place, and is rescued by a masked man, calling himself 'V'. She subsequently has an opportunity to repay the debt by helping him, and the story progresses from there. 'V' is a man with a single-minded mission  to destroy the machinery of the state and allow democracy to grab a chance. In a way, the tale, although well told and well acted, is only a useful metaphor for the real story  a warning of just how close we could be to the events depicted. Increasing control of people's lives, under the excuse of anti-terrorism and protection of the state, has led to a constant fear of being who you really are, if that means something other than what the State requires 'You wear a mask for so long, you forget who you were beneath it.' is a comment by the character played by Stephen Fry. Hugo Weaving is superb. His performance (in a Guy Fawkes mask the whole film) is all the more chilling for being understated and calm, (except when he's rescuing Natalie Portman or flashing knives around!) Despite not being able to see his face, his voice and body posture give us his character. Natalie Portman convinces with a stunning performance as a young woman who has been intimidated by the state for most of her life. The cinematography is also praiseworthy. Unlike some dark and disturbing films, which are shot in dark and disturbing colours (or near pitch black!) this is rendered in natural, if muted, tones and daylight is daylight and bright and stark corridors of hospitals, etc. are actually bright. This helps to make the scenes believable, real, adding to the chill. The ending is spectacular. To say more would spoil it for you. This is a splendid piece of work, and I believe, a very important film. It has rightly had a scattering of awards and nominations but Hollywood in its all-too-frequent parochial ignorance has thus far not seen fit to dish out an Oscar or two, whilst lavishing praise on a handful of over-hyped trash in recent years. If you haven't yet seen it  see it. It's the best movie I've seen in quite a while. And it makes you think.",
590,31 May 2009,film-critic,6, Chapter 11: Valhalla,"""V for Vendetta"" is more than just a masked terrorist running amok in a futuristic Britain; it is more than just the quick wits of an anti-hero challenging the government; and it is far more than just the follow-up film from the Wachowski brothers. This is a philosophical cinematic entry disguised as a blockbuster. While most will argue that it is a poor excuse for the graphic novel (and slightly I agree) because it doesn't follow the story frame by frame, the themes are still pulled through. Looking back into the graphic novel, the changes made from page to screen were dramatic, yet bold. The ""happy"" ending in the film gives way to the more dismal, slightly uplifting ending in the graphic novel. The main difference between the two is the lack of grittiness, one could call it realism, found within the story and missing in the film. ""V for Vendetta"" the film is beautiful, watched in full HD, the sound, visuals, and colors are exactly the opposite from the graphic novel, and while comparing the two is not the extent of this review, it is an element that needs to be considered. Alan Moore took his name off this film, reading the graphic novel will explain why.",

592,14 July 2013,l_rawjalaurence,8, Hugely Influential Version of Classic Graphic Novel,"V for Vendetta is one of those films that transcends its source-material and becomes a truly influential piece of work. Set in a Fascist Great Britain following the victory of Germany in World War II, it shows the mysterious V (Hugo Weaving) taking revenge on all those government servants and employees who consciously used human beings for experiments, while deliberately creating an epidemic so as to encourage the people to support them. Among the assorted bad guys he exterminates are Roger Allam as a military leader and media personality (bearing a strong resemblance to the UK Independence Party's Nigel Farage), Sinead Cusack as a crooked scientist and John Hurt as a truly awe-inspiring Big Brother figure. V is aided in his quest by Evie Rutherford (Natalie Portman), who discovers a lot about herself and her commitment in the process. With astounding special effects, including a rousing climax when the Houses of Parliament is set on fire - in a deliberate reenactment of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 - V FOR VENDETTA offers a chilling vision of what can happen to so-called 'democracies,' when individuals acquire too much power. If nothing else, we should aim to retain the capacity to disagree with people, even at the cost of our own lives.",

The Wachowski Brothers and director James McTeigue recreated the graphic novel as a film depicting a grim, bleak future where England has been manipulated into a reactionary government.

Makes you wary of the danger of incremental power accretions while providing an entertaining and emotive experience. Natalie Portman was finally given a role in which she could flex some acting muscles after the disasters that were her lines in Star Wars and Hugo Weaving excels at imparting emotion without having to reveal his face - acting with only his voice, he demonstrated a real appreciation of his craft and testified to the potency of words alone. There were certainly some scenes inappropriate for children and yet there were also scenes that need to be seen, images of things that might have happened, could be happening and are likely to happen so long as the public remains acquiescent. Although the movie preys on current fears and worst-case scenarios, it is well to remember that it is a commentary on the potency of fear as a weapon of power, and not confined to the specifics of contemporary environments.

610,23 September 2006,Fever,9, Brilliant!!,"I've always been a fan of plot lines where an enigmatic masked man befriends a beautiful woman. Call it the hopeless romantic in me, but it's one of my favorites. The added bonus with this movie is the political overtones with religious zealot leaders who are determined to rule the world through fear and intimidation. Ever wonder why you always see religion followed by violence? This movie brilliantly shows how in times of desperation, we turn to any leader who's willing to come forth, and then become blind to his corruption. (sound familiar?) This movie also makes the conspiracy theory wheels turn in your mind. Does our government create disasters in order to gain political favor? Were some of our recent tragedies known about, or even worse, planned by our own government? V for Vendetta does exactly what it set out to do: get you thinking about political corruption, absolute power and religious abuse. Aside from the political message, there's also the romantic undertones. Mix some Phantom of the Opera with Beauty and the Beast and a dash of Stockholm Syndrome, then you've got the perfect pairing of Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman. The only downside to the movie is the sound. Because V is always wearing a mask, it's very hard to hear what he is saying. Have the volume at the ready. Otherwise, I loved this movie!",

I expected that we were moving towards a more and more free society, but it turns out the opposite. By the way, this movie was taken away from douban, aka the Chinese IMDb.

612,10 April 2006,phillipstephenso,10, Superb,"The film makes several allusions to the famous Guy Fawkes plot when the Catholics (including Guy Fawkes) placed 36 barrels of gunpowder in a cellar under the palace of Westminster in England. on November 5, 1605, in hopes of improving their lot by blowing up James I and the English Parliament and by placing Elizabeth, daughter of James I, on the English throne as their puppet ruler. However, Fawkes was arrested with the barrels of gunpowder in the tunnel under the House of Lords and was tortured with unspeakable methods until he divulged the names of the conspirators. Lord Salisbury as prime minister then began to use the plot to taint all of the Catholics. The reverberations of this plot contain the energy sustaining V for Vendetta. This film supposes that a similar plot against the present British government is going to lead to another extreme reaction and to the rise of a totalitarian government similar to that found in 1984. V for Vendetta is the underground resistance to that totalitarianism that stoops to using terrorism against the British people to maintain the conditions of its absolute power. The movie is full of pageantry and suspense and mystery. And, V is Zorro on steroids, who fights against overwhelming evil.",

Truth is spun by men in suits into something unrecognisable, civilians are spied upon, and are subjugated by the skilled exploitation of their fears  which have largely been invoked by the very people who exploit them. The fact that a film which has, truthfully, to be lumped into the superhero genre, is so prescient is incredible.",
616,20 March 2006,zetes,7, A film that should be easily dismissable,"It has a very mixed message and one of the sloppiest screenplays I've encountered in quite some time (Andy and Larry Wachowski, the directors and screenwriters of the Matrix Trilogy, are responsible for it). The lead character wears a mask the entire time, so the character has almost no ability to engage the audience himself. Plus, nearer the end, he is turned from a person into a purely figurative symbol. Natalie Portman has to carry the entire movie, and, while she's very beautiful, even when shaved bald, she's not a strong enough performer to accomplish the task (plus, her British accent is less than believable). There are also a ton of silly and unbelievable moments. However, with all that against it, V for Vendetta has some intriguing ideas and is a fairly rousing picture in the end. The story posits a fascist government in Britain in the near future (or in an alternative present). Most of the film's value exists in the believability of this government and how it operates. The film pays close attention to how the government and the media control the people. The references to modern day America are clear, and it's not hard to buy that a similar course of events could take place. There's even scenes where the government is listening into citizens, which is a current event that couldn't have been news when this script was being written. A fair amount of our population, directly after September 11th, said that they would give up their privacies and freedoms in exchange for safety. The hero of the film, V, is a terrorist, any way you look at it, and that is problematic for sure. The movie does not necessarily side with his cause completely, but it certainly doesn't reject his ideas either. The movie uses the story of Guy Fawkes; V wants to carry out what Fawkes failed at. If you know the story, you might guess the ending. But as my friend wondered, how would the movie be accepted if the film had ended with the Capitol building in Washington D.C. being destroyed? A difficult movie to deal with, but definitely worth sitting through.",

The dialogs in this movie is just... sharp. Sure, there are many dialogs, but most of them will lead you to think deeply again of how this movie correlates to the real world. Sure, there are action scenes, but they are not the main attraction. Rather, it was how V interacts with the other characters, and how they life changes with the interaction.

Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are wonderful, I mean I would watch N.P. eat breakfast and be happy, but certain aspects of their interactions are gut wrenchingly cliché and silly. The plot stresses simplicity and often the audience is informed of things rather than shown them just to make sure no one got lost on the straight as an arrow plot. Unfortunately simplicity does not prevent plot holes and this movie is rife with inconsistencies, omissions, pointless twists, a huge subplot with no resolution and perhaps the most cliché romantic dialogue imaginable. It isn't horrible, it isn't The Day After Tomorrow or Troy (prime examples of terrible blockbusters) but it is standard Hollywood fare and any message presented is done far more compellingly elsewhere no matter what your politics (it borrows a lot of it's ideologies from Bowling for Columbine).

While it has lost a little of its power in the years since, there's no denying that it is still one of the most entertaining and provocative movies of the 21st century. Recounting the plot is almost pointless now, as most everyone who's into movies knows it at this point. What I can say is that all of the performances are excellent, in particular Hugo Weaving as V. Despite having a mask over his face, or being obscured through darkness, he manages to give a performance with a lot of depth and nuance. He might represent an idea or symbol, but he brings humanity to his character and more than a little bit of wit (and wordplay). I still think that Natalie Portman is the weak link in the cast, but she isn't terrible, by any means. As far as the technical aspects go, most of the special effects still hold up rather well and the film, as a whole, is beautifully shot. There's also some variation on the bullet-time effect that the Wachowskis popularized with their Matrix trilogy (and who wrote this screenplay). James McTeigue, the director and long-time Wachowski collaborator, did his finest directing work with this film in my opinion. Overall, with an engaging, well-acted story that has still has relevant political themes, you can't get much better than this. And may this film never be forgot.",

636,29 July 2006,xredgarnetx,7, OK comic book action,"V FOR VENDETTA is a nicely realized adaptation of an old graphic novel by Alan Moore. V (Hugo Weaving) is a Zorro-like character who defends the weak and punishes the corrupt regime that rules the people. Set in near-future England, V takes on the entire British government, run with an iron first by a sickly-looking John Hurt. A very sharp detective played by Stephen Rea is close on V's heels, and a lovely young innocent played by Natalie Portman becomes V's devoted ally. V is a terrorist, but a sympathetic one as he goes about blowing up buildings and battling cops and soldiers. V FOR VENDETTA also has a little bit of Batman and the Scarlet Pimpernel in it, and the ever-disguised hero has fashioned his ""new"" life from THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. The movie falters midway when Portman is imprisoned and tortured for a lengthy period, but picks up again for a slam-bang finale as V and Portman plot to blow up Parliament.

For such an amateur director, James McTeigue did a wonderful job. each scene is crafted perfectly and the movie flows. Also, there are some good performances from the supporting cast, especially Stephen Rea, who gives a dry but charismatic performance as the cop investigating V. There is also a great message to the film and although advertised as an action film, it is purely drama, and drama at it's best. With some comedy, action, drama, mystery, and even romance, This movie truly has it all and is a must see for all movie lovers alike.",

Many obvious shots at the Bush administration, Bill O'Reilly, and the Fox Network as all propaganda factors for today's government. Obvious characters formed after George Bush and Dick Cheney. They also visit terrorism in all forms, and actually state "" sometimes you have to destroy a building"". Hmmmm. 9-11 reference ? Or just trying to stir the pot on what brings HATRED.

645,21 March 2006,jon.h.ochiai,8, V not for Vision,"Homage to 17th century British anarchist Guy Fawkes is not the most obvious role model for the protagonist in ""V for Vendetta"". This is one of the surprising choices in Andy and Larry Wachowski's screenplay ""V for Vendetta""-- their much awaited motion picture project since the Matrix trilogy. This time around they delegated directing duties to James McTeiguean unfamiliar name. Set in future, perhaps 25 years or so, England is a fascist State lead by Dictator Adam Sutler (John Hurt). Apparently the result of world war and economic collapse, Sutler rules England through a futuristic Reign of Terror. ""V"" ambitiously asks us to distinguish between nihilist, anarchist, and patriotwhich may really be a matter of point of view or locality. The Wachowski Brothers aim to make a movie about ideas and the notion that the lines between terrorism and patriotism are often blurred. However, this conceit is not entirely original. Philosopher Will Durant said of originality, ""Nothing is new except arrangement."" ",

Hugh Weaving was well cast and he gave the character of V great charisma, wit and made him strangely attractive ( although that could just be me). Natalie Portman's character Evey was good and provided the typical love interest but the way the film ends, with V dying just after they realise how they feel about each other was well shot and portrayed the emotions felt by both characters. However, I don not think that she is a particularly good actress as some of her scenes are quite wooden, although this could also just be the fact that her lines weren't as interesting or as well written as V's. In general, however, the film is astonishing. The acting, the plot-line and that final scene of the Houses of Parliament blowing up make one leave the cinema completely blown away and the film is definitely a diamond in the rough of other recent releases which just cannot compare!",

I've never heard of the director of this one and I've never bothered with the seemingly incomprehensible MATRIX trilogy (whose makers serve as the screenwriters here) but, as I said before, I found it to be an intelligent, enjoyable and altogether very satisfying outing which, thankfully, seems not be the start of another franchise which diminishes in quality with every subsequent entry...",

While the primary theme of rebellion can at it's best be cathartic, and the relationship between it's two principle characters fascinating and inspiring, as usual the Wachowski's overpower their themes with unnecessary exposition, subplots that deter rather then add, and dialog delivered that still feels like it comes from the page in it's profound, but showman-like and detached nature. What saves Vendetta from all these pratfalls however is the heavy handed yet accessibly executed instigation behind the essence of what one yearns for when they yearn to be free. In that, Alan Moore, Wachowski's, and Hugo Weaving have etched into his character V the most compelling, larger then life character since Tyler Durden. To all those who would rather embrace an ideal rather then mull over minor distractions, enjoy this film's core.

669,12 April 2006,earagogo,10, One of the most important movies you will ever see,"This movie adaptation of the graphic novel is an astounding feast for the eyes, thought food for your head and a emotive testament to the power of people in the face of adversity. The original 'comic' was set in a fictional version of neo-Nazi Thatcher era Britain, but taking out actual historical figures (apart from Guy Fawkes) gives the piece a much bigger net to cast. With enough fantastic fight scenes, and things blowing up to keep the action fans happy, V brings a multi-layered complexity, poetry and wit that one does not usually associate with this kind of movie. Even though it is fiercely British (the dismissive and passing references to the civil war in ""the former United States"" is a powerful backdrop) one of the things that gives this movie such a resounding impact is the parallels that can be drawn to current world events. If power corrupts, then absolute power corrupts absolutely. It looks at how governments control the media, mutate and mold the publics perceptions and use questionable methods to their own ends. The tag line of 'People should not be afraid of their Governments, Governments should be afraid of their people', is such a powerful and brave thing to say in this day and age when countries all over the world initiate sedition and treason laws. It's theatrical release was held back in the UK due to the London bombings and it's easy to understand why, but I'll spare you the spoilers. Their are some incredible performances, Natalie Portman as Evie gives perhaps the best performance of her career. John Hurt's malevolent High Chancellor is a seething cauldron of hatred. Stephen Fry as Gordon is magnificent and gives a glimpse of what I hope will be more dramatic roles for him. And then there is V, played by Hugo Weaving, who although you never see his face gives a remarkable portrayal full of humour, madness, righteous vengeance and tenderness. That mask will forever evoke strong feeling in me. V FOR VENDETTA is an absolute must see movie.",

However, the first 30 minutes of this film, though full of action, failed to grip me (maybe there should have been an explanation at the start about what was going on exactly), Natalie Portman's acting failed to convince me (and I'm a fan of hers usually!), the love story between the two main characters was bizarre, and sometimes it becomes rather difficult to work out exactly what is going on.

The beginning is very good, and I thought it would be to plain at first. In her other movies, she was always bold in every one of them. In the beginning, she looks more naive than bold.

It's not that at all, which is why it's one of the most underrated films in the IMDb top 250. Alan Moore has distanced himself from this, but this adaptation actually worked out. V, played by Hugo Weaving who gives a strong performance despite being underneath a mask for the whole film, has launched a one man revolution against the corrupt British Government. A young woman played by Natalie Portman who is good aside from a grating fake English accent becomes his unlikely ally. VFV certainly isn't what it looks like. V kills his victims through lethal injection and there aren't many fight scenes in the whole film. It's actually quite a talky movie which focuses on its social commentary and thought provoking narrative. VFV has a little too much talking and in terms of political commentary its pretty much an adolescent version and there's not actually that much political stuff which is that relevant, although the film is still thought provoking.",

I am just pointing out how beautifully done this movie is. It also, appeals to many people. There is action, pyrotechnics, love, and crazy twists. I hope that everyone is able to see and appreciate this incredible movie.",

697,18 March 2006,Aomalle27,5, Visually stunning....but plot-wise weak,"This movie was surprising a great film...visually. However; plot-wise the film generally lacked. Natalie Portman plays a young woman in post apocalyptic Great Britan, London to be more specific. Appartently America engaged in a war with Radical Muslims (sound familiar?) was struck with a terrible plague, and basically collapsed as a nation. There's even a mention of a civil war in the midwest. But alas, I digress. The Great Britain of P.A. days is one ruled ruthlessly, much like prewar Germany of the late 30's early 40's. They even have their own Nazi-like insignia, and a secret police called fingermen. They pretty much push people around, spy on people, and even do random kidnappings of citizens in the middle of the night. We open with Portman's Avey character sneaking out in the middle of the night; past a government induced curfew. She is confronted by some fingermen, who basically push her around and try to rape her. (Does this happen in every lady in distress situation? I mean don't thugs do other things?) Anyway; enter V. A vigilante out for vengeance. You might actually say he's on a Vendetta. Ha, Ha! Very clever of the Wachowski brothers, making their title slyly work like that. Well, Avey's taken in by V, and he reveals his plan. Cause a revolution by celebrating Guy Fawlkes day by accomplishing what G.F. failed at in the 1500's; blowing up Parliament. Too much of this movie seems like the same old propaganda railing against the current Presidential administration of the U.S. Innuendo that this president spies on his own fellow citizens, imprisons them, and even kills them. It comes across more as leftist propaganda than entertainment. Where ""Farenheit 911"" was entertaining and funny in sarcastic tone, this is just thinly veiled disgust for the Bush America. They also make reference to the Americas being responsible for global destruction and causing the plague (pre-film). A character goes so far as to call America God-less. That's a first for me? Aren't we supposed to be a nation of religious zealots. Well, the great Nazi...oops, I mean controlled society of Adam Sutler (John Hurt as an obvious Hitler ripoff right down to the Nazi salute), wants total control of their society. It is revealed that they actually caused a pandemic on their own people to wrest control of the British society, and the film follows a morality tale of not giving too much power to government. Not enough strength to the plot to make it a great film, visually stunning enough to make it a good film.",
698,22 November 2018,arthur_tafero,7, Entertaining Revolution - V for Vendetta,"Dwight Eisenhower warned us of the military-industrial complex, and George Orwell warned us of Big Brother, Terry Gilliam illustrated full bureaucratic control of our lives in Brazil (and later with The Zero Theorem), and V for Vendetta reminds us that every now and then, we need a revolution. Recent revolutions in the world include the American Revolution, the French Revolution, The Russian Revolution, and the Chinese Revolution. One could even say in 1989, there was an Anti-USSR Revolution. The producers and directors of this film were most likely influenced by Lech Welesa and Solidarity with its revolt against the USSR. It is ironic that countries that were created by revolutions eventually become countries that need them again.
England has not really had one of these revolutions; so the premise of the film is interesting. As a film, standing on cinematic standards alone, it is entertaining, uneven, has problems with pacing, but has strong character development, a good story, and excellent production values. The cast is excellent as well. Natalie Portman is superb, as is John Hurt. Today, we obviously have Anonymous as a new revolutionary force in the world order. How effective they are is a matter of opinion and conjecture. However, they would appear to be a healthy outgrowth of the need of countries to give themselves a good enema once in awhile. Well worth viewing.",

Inspector Finch's part - the best role here, in fact. The man is solid, cool and he is so full of inner pain and desire to find the truth that his part becomes nearly the central in the film. 3. The main ""Baddie""- the Chancellor - looks so pathetic, but then is full of threat and evil.

711,28 November 2014,buckikris,9," A Glimpse Into The Future, Maybe.","I just watched this movie the other night, and it was amazing. The beginning starts off with the words, Remember, Remember The 5th of November. This is the time period around the mid 1600's that Guy Fawkes plan to blow up Parliament failed. He was captured along with his cohorts. He was taken to the gallows and hung for his crime. Once we see Fawkes hung we are take some four hundred years into a Fascist England. I would say the year in the film is around 2020. We meet Evey a young lady watching a Totalitarian T.V. show, the host Deitrich. He is explaining why England is in the state it's in due to all the war's the, homosexuality, the disease, ETC.. Evey is in her Uncle's apartment, she turns and looks at the clock and notices she is past curfew. While walking home she gets caught by the secret police. They rough her up and try to rape her. V who is an anti- hero in the movie comes to her rescue. He is wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, he saves Evey by killing the men with the knives he carries. He ask if she is hurt, and from then on it seems the two form somewhat of a bond. It is like Evey is his protégé. She is loyal; but she keeps her guard up around him, like his he a friend or foe. She is or to me like his prisoner at first; but more of an ally as the movie proceeds, especially near the end of the movie. Since this is in the future 2020/2030, we realize in the beginning the United States does not exist anymore. There are wars, plagues,; and fascist rule is the norm in Britain. Evey and V get to know each other better and she finds out by accident he was horribly burned. V explains his past to her, about Larkhill prison. A place where criminals and undesirables where housed. They suffered inhumane treatment, pawns in awful experiments, then dumped in mass graves. He was lucky to escape due to a fire and vowed to get his revenge on those who worked there. One night Evey is watching the news and hears about the murder of Deitrich. Then asks V if he was responsible, he says yes. The vengeance begins, and V strikes back leaving a rose at each murder scene. Even after this happens Evey proves her loyalty to him. She gets kidnapped and held as a prisoner. Little does she know that V is responsible for the kidnapping. While being held prisoner she finds a note written by a young woman who was a prisoner at Larkhill. Evey reads it explains about her lesbian relationships and how family and society treated her. A relationship that grew despite the backlash from parents and society. The secret police found out and got her partner first, then came for her. Evey's loyalty continued for V, even while being locked up. When she was able to escape she finds out V in living in the basement/lockup of Larkhill. She is upset at first thinking the whole thing was a hoax. The note was true the girl was the prisoner next to him. She learns a lot from his past by this time, and is more than an ally. In the end, they track down V, even though V dies his plan to blow up Parliament gets carried out by Evey. This is a great anti-hero movie. The cast was great and because of the plot I am glad there wasn't any backlash towards the movie. I am surprise no one in England complained about it, the Government. Even though I didn't care for The Matrix, I loved this gem of a movie. This film has it all, comedy, tragedy, suspense, and action. This is a great movie that balances out the yin and yang, you will not be disappointed. THX, Kris L. CocKayne",

713,20 March 2006,HockeyFan13,9, Excellent Work,"Excellent work from all involved. Being a fan of all 3 Matrix movies, (no thats not a typo) I obviously had this movie in my sights for quite a while. It captures everything the Wachowski's crew does well, and leaves what they do not do well pretty much out of sight here. The Effects are seamless, the acting is superb, the story is powerful. The picture starts like many other super hero/comic movies start off. Damsel in distress gets saved from being attacked, robbed and raped by said superhero. After this scene, it becomes something else, something different, which is what the Wachowski's crew is so good at. The Matrix was like something we have never seen before, and V for Vendetta is no different. Hugo Weaving gives as wonderful a performance though his face is concealed he uses his mannerisms, voice, and body language to do his acting for him. Portman buries her work from Closer and gives maybe the performance of her career. Go see it, you wont be disappointed.",
714,19 March 2006,alison_w51,10, A bang from start to finish,"I went to see this film with average expectations. The trailers were there, the posters were there but was it really going to be all that good. Well I can safely say it was, I was glued to my seat. When I wasn't listening intently to every syllable coming from the mouth of the hero V, I was delighted with exciting fight sequences and a few explosions which left me feeling nothing less than liberated. When someone informed me that Hugo Weaving would have the mask on throughout the entire film I was concerned that the character would never be able to connect with an audience at all never mind portray strong emotions, key to such a character and I believed I would quickly loose interest. However Weaving managed to keep me extremely intrigued by V. Something I could never have imagined possible without having seen it done. Weaving has a charisma perfect for this role and I can't imagine anyone else playing V so well. The other actors also kept me interested in every character that came across the screen, especially John Hurt who I thoroughly enjoyed hating. Natalie Portman was a joy to watch. Although her British accent wasn't so fantastic her presence on screen more than makes up for it. The non-conventional theme of fascist governments and terrorist hero's may not be for everybody but I certainly found this film one of the most entertaining things I've seen in a long time.

But this film.. man. It's just so raw in it's presentation. The 2 hour run-time passes by quite fluidly. It's entertaining as hell and beautifully performed by Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman with the remainder of the cast not having to hide their performances. Everybody's doing great.
The story is pretty simple but maintains a level of intrigue that keeps investment high. The characters all have character to them and barely anyone serves a singular function.
Most importantly, it's memorable. For the strong presentation. The powerful performances. The somewhat messy, yet entertaining action sequences.

This movie is about politics, love, family values, and standing up for what you believe to be right. No matter what the cost, no matter what could happen, or what one is threatened with. It takes a vast amount of courage to stand up for what you believe to be right. And that is exactly what this movie is about.

Driven by a personal vendetta, a mysterious individual William Rookwood (Hugo Weaving) comes to the forefront to take up the cause of freedom. He wears a mask of Guy Fawkes to cover his face, and changes his name to only V. V's mission is to kill all the doctors who had tortured him at the detention center, and bring back justice to the country. On November 5, in the process of blowing up his first building, V rescues a young woman, Evey (Natalie Portman), from the secret police.

One glaring mistake is the use of Natalie Portman, probably a fine actress, but she can't fake a British accent. Since she has to carry much of the movie (after all the other main character is masked) this is a major problem. Overall the movie comes out as fake and pompous.

744,19 March 2006,jhansman,9, A truly enjoyable movie,"Whenever I read these user reviews on IMDb, I alway groan when the reviewer can't resist telling us the entire plot, so I won't similarly bore you. Instead, let's see if I can just convince you to see this film without giving away too much while still enticing you, eh? Well, just know the movie is expertly set, acted, and edited. I went to see this film mostly out of curiosity, and because initial reviews were so good and I love Natalie Portman. Here she leaves her lovely self behind to exercise her considerable actingskills, and succeeds. As good as she is, Hugo Weaving as 'V' is even better. He commands the screen while in a role hidden behind mask and cape. This, to me, is a true acting tour de force. Because Weaving cannot use facial gestures to convey meaning and nuance, he must do so with voice and simple head and hand gestures. I was absolutely stunned at how well he accomplished this, with the aid of some very good dialogue. In one of the cast interviews now circulating on the web, he was asked whether he still used facial expressions under his mask while delivering his lines. He replied that of course he did, that he had to, and to do otherwise would have caused him to fail at his part. Watch him closely as you listen closely, and you may be surprised at how expressive he is. The other actors all comport themselves quiet well (John Hurt is a bit over the top), and propel the plot along nicely. This film combines the best elements of action, intrigue, suspense and pathos. It does go off track a bit in the middle for the sake of filling us in on character background, but I found this tolerable, if not necessary. All in all, 'V for Vendetta' succeeds. See it on the big screen while you can.",

Similarities are many to the original 1984 (as in all totalitarian regimes) and the presentation of things is both amazing and intense. Acting is brilliant by all of the actors and the appearance of some action scenes does not spoil the film at all. The most wonderful about this film is the fact that it presents imaginary facts with a tremendous resemblance to todays ""war on terrorism"". In the end terrorists are which ones ? Even all the citizens of your own country ? Words like freedom and safety sometimes get on the opposite sides of the road. There are big similarities (at least in behavior) between the Prime Minister of the film and other totalitarian leaders. Anyway ... what an amazing film !!!",

And to top it all off, you blow stuff up to the 1812 overture? Come on! Throw in CG motion trails on knives, and a love admission eerily reminiscent of the original Matrix, and this thing just overloads on cheese. The themes of good and evil, the symbolism is so over-explained and illustrated in this movie that it's almost insulting. Combine that with a ridiculous and overly simplistic plot and you get not only a numb backside, but a numb head as well.

752,7 April 2006,malthus86,3, Alan Moore's Curse Holds True.,"Alan Moore is the author of the original graphic novel from which this movie is based. It is a work of literary art from cover to cover and one of my all-time favorite reads, right up there with Virginia Woolf and William Wordsworth. However, there is a Hollywood Curse looming over his head. You see, several of his stories have made it to the big screen, whether you realized it or not. Swamp Thing - 1982 (while he didn't create the character, he reinvented and repopularized him which is what prompted the movie in the first place) From Hell - 2001 The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen - 2003 Also during the 80s another of his works (Watchmen) was opted but the movie fell through before fruition and he's been fighting to get the rights back for years. Now a big studio owns the movie rights and is going ahead with it against his wishes. Why against his wishes? Because every single movie has been an abhorrent perversion of his original work. While it is probably the best movie adaptation of his work, V for Vendetta is still tragically a horrible representation of Moore's message. It was twisted into cheap Hollywood propaganda to try and poke fun at the current US administration. As much as I enjoy anything that take's George W Bush and Co. down a peg or two, I don't enjoy being manipulated, and that's how this movie made me feel. It also veered very far off the point of the graphic novel, by cutting out every significant subplot and twisting the overall idea of V (the graphic novel is about breaking down any and all barriers and boundaries to discover one's true self and connection with the world around you; the movie, on the other hand, pushes an agenda of liberalism within the constricts of currently acceptable western social archetypes) and not to mention the vastly different ending, which was the nail in the coffin for me that the Wachowski Brothers just simply DIDN'T GET IT. The pacing is hindered with the badly timed, badly integrated flashbacks, particularly one of the most important scenes of Evey's discovery of Valerie's note. Without any of the of other storytelling elements of Moore's original graphic novel, the flashbacks feel forced and divisive. Another major flaw is the exceptionally crappy Matrix effects during the ""climatic"" (or rather anti-climatic) end fight scene. It's one thing for bullets to ripple the air in a computer simulation, but another for knives to have ugly windows mouse trails in unnecessary slow motion. The scene had no purpose, no soul, no tension. It was boring. The only saving grace of the film was Hugo Weaving, who provided a perfect voice for the mask. Unfortunately all the best lines from the comic were cut. V was left feeling exceptionally rigid and lucid; calculating and painfully sane. And while calculating he certainly was in the comic, sane he was not. The madness, and therefore the joy of not knowing what he'd say or do next, was lost. His ""plan"" was obvious and uninspired, as was this movie. It didn't make me want to change the world or change myself. It just made me want to write Alan Moore an apology letter for having watched this movie. I could go on and on about how they ruined Evey's character by writing her as too strong, too smart, and too independent and overly romanticized her and V (especially considering how she thought V might be her father in the original work) but I've wasted enough of my time on this movie which I never plan on seeing again.",

767,23 November 2006,faunsix,2, I have seen this film,"I read about the comic a long time before I saw the film, and I was intrigued about how it would be handled on celluloid. England is run by a totalitarian regime some time in the future, the leader of the regime is played by John Hurt, who, fittingly played the role of Winston Smith in Michael Radford's version of 1984. The author of the graphic novels the film is based on apparently walked out of the premiere of the movie, and I can see why. The director of V for Vendetta obviously has a great love of the comic, because he does try to deal with the issues that are raised in the comic, but his ineptness as a director lets the comic down, badly. Among the issues, are how fear (caused by terrorism) can allow the public to be manipulated by politicians who then push through draconian laws which they claim to be for the good of the people but are actually covering darker ulterior motives. The editing is cringingly bad, it really makes you wonder if there was a director behind the production at all, the leads (Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving) rush their way through a script that clunks and grinds along for most of the movie. The 'relationship' between Portman's and Weaving's characters is totally implausible because there is not even a hint of a gradual development of Portman's trust in 'V', who is, after all quite a dubious character given that he wears a mask the whole time. That you're expected to believe in The dodgy London English accents (I should know, since I am a born and bred Londoner) add's to the farcical catalogue of other things that make this a bad film. I actually got quite angry about this one, because the subject matter is topical and raises a lot of questions, but it could have been handled so much better by a more accomplished director.",

789,16 March 2006,greek2thebone,6," Decent, but not as good as heralded","V for Vendetta is an interesting movie in the sense that it features both superhero blockbuster action, as well as a political message. The political message is not subtle: it warns of the dangers of power abuse resulting from people's political indifference. Sadly, the hero's path to political action is one of violence and rebellion. The parallels between current American policies in the name of ""freedom"" and ""righteousness"" and the totalitarian British state are remarkable. The scenes greatly remind me of Michael Radford's 1984, especially the prison and torture scenes. The use of humour attempts to make the movie lighter and it does, but I find it to be unnecessary and resulting to occasionally stupid and out of place dialogue. The superhero part of the movie is not much better even though the director puts a valiant effort to develop the hero's character. Alas, V is no Batman but he definitely has a more romantic and intellectual air to it. An overall good effort which could be much better if the production was more serious.

I can't really say that I'm disappointed nor am I very satisfied about it. One thing is clear though - the message of the flick is good, yet it feels slightly adjusted to reach a broad audience (which I suppose many flicks are intended to). The reluctant acting and agitation feels raw in a very ""cool"" way, but in reality, which this piece is trying to draw a parallel to, it isn't really that ""cool"". Opposing the government is at times depicted as something necessary and ""right"", whilst it at times becomes a little bit too much and I can easily see if some people may sound the alarm, crying out that this flick is filled with hypocrisy.",

England is ruled by a dictator similar to ""1984""'s Big Brother(who is played in a weird twist by John Hurt who was the victim in the latest movie version of the book). The character V was one of the subjects of the government's experiments with chemical weapons and was disfigured in a fire when they decided to shut it down but he survived and now wears a mask to cover the burns. He now has vengeance and justice in mind for those who caused the fire and for the government. Natalie Portman's character comes on the scene when she is used by him to get into the nationally controlled television station and make his own announcement. The announcement concerns him celebrating a late freedom's fighters attempt at blowing up parliamant and getting hanged for it on the anniversary of the event. It's amazing how complex this movie is considering it's based on a graphic novel where only the illustrator get's credit.(I'm sure the Wachowski bro's who wrote the screenplay added some things) Overall, the feeling of the movie is that we're supposed to think that violence is the only way to bring down this type of nation. This is truly a disturbing thought, although it might be true. It is an interesting story that brings much thought as to what matters most to your mind when it ends, but it's not that great of a movie.

When one compares the acting in V with films like Star Wars The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi or any of the silly Marvel films it becomes so evident that there are actors and there are actors in this world. A film can be replete with special effects yet the actors could be deeply stirring.

853,22 March 2006,flicklover,8, Finally!!! A decent film in the worst time of the year.,"From about January to the beginning of May every year, I dread going to the movie, Most of the films that come out at this time are bad. Whether they be action , drama , or comedy. A few times there are surprises, but most of the time the movies are average at best. Well V for Vendetta is the first film I've seen all year that I could say that I actually liked. The story is basically a mix of 1984 meets the crow, and has elements of all comic/graphic novel films that came before it. But it has good dialog and even manages to have something to say. It takes place in the near future and the UK has turned into a totalitarian society. A masked man goes around London blowing things up, and is branded a terrorist. Evfen though the story doesn't make this guy into an all out hero, I will say that in a post 9/11 world, blowing buildings up is a touchy subject. I wouldn't say that the makers of this film advocate this kind of protest, but the film make the case that governments use fear to control the population. Though many people have stated that this is a direct criticism of the current Bush/Blair world, I think that the film's ideas can be applied to any sort of governing body. Many would say that it is an irresponsible premise, that argument is also valid, but I think the movie doesn't go deep enough for it to be a problem. It is after all a work of pulp fiction.",

I guess that is what the future brings. Natalie Portman gives a lukewarm performance, but Hugo Weaving is excellent especially considering he is behind an expressionless mask - it really was a mask not a Keano Reaves impression! While well crafted and well acted, this film is not ground breaking entertainment. The special effects are good, although when the action comes it is a bit bloody. The idea of Guy Fawkes as anarchistic is amusing although totally inaccurate.

I have nothing against Natalie Portman, who gives a fine performance here as always. But the entire movie is just plain dull. I mean the political content is good (even if it's too obvious to be smart) but as a movie itself, it's really bad. There is no arch, no real story to grip on, the characters have no emotions, no personal story. The way it's filmed is annoying as is Hugo Weaving who has nothing to do but talking with a mask in a theatrical manner. The fights are not even bad-ass.

Now, it is quite modernized and Hollywood-ized, so don't expect exactly the same level of sophistication - it does take a few scenes to get used to seeing V, as he does naturally come off as silly on the big screen as compared to his pen-and-inked literary counterpart, but overall it isn't badly done at all.

Let me start by saying that Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving did an excellent job, they really captured their characters well. I thought the Wachowski's really gave a good feel of how bad of a situation the world was in by frequently showing news clips of how terrible America was functioning.I liked the pace of the movie, too, though I must admit that I did get lost a couple times, but got right back into it. This is definitely not a movie for everyone, the story is complex and makes you think. It's no Pulp Fiction, but it's harder to follow than average films are. Do not go into this movie expecting it to be action-packed or full of violence, because it's not, but that doesn't mean it's not a great film. Also, I loved the ending, I thought it played out very well. Overall, great film, 9/10.",

875,28 February 2021,christopher-underwood,7, I probably should not have watched this the day after 'Children of Men',"As another example of dystopian cinema, I probably should not have watched this the day after 'Children of Men', compared to which, this seems a rather shallow and long-winded, slow-moving, exercise in style. Is is well enough made, however, with an engaging storyline and good performances. It is interesting to note that compared to John Hurt's worryingly brutal appearances with the dictator's face blown up large that of 'V' is hidden behind a mask. This reduces the impact, for we are simply looking at an inanimate object (the mask) while he speaks, at length. To the makers' credit this makes the main character akin to how he must appear in the graphic novel and comics but to someone not familiar with the paper format there will always be some element of disengagement. It follows that our engagement with the main character will be reduced and for all the massive amount of time and dedication that must have gone into the choreography, a certain distance remains. An extremely brave film that utilises the Guy Fawkes tale and weaves it into a more general anti authoritarian stance with believable depictions of London in disarray. Interesting that the filmmakers should choose Britain and not the US for their depiction of the dictatorship but then I guess they are simply following the original source material.",

877,16 April 2006,ezwerk,4, For the lowest common denominator,"Being a fan of the comic, I was greatly disappointed in what the Wachowski Bros. did to the story. Not much of the original is intact other than the basic plot. Subtle hints to V's identity are now blatant signs, and the almost hidden love story is now a sappy romance novel and the dark, gritty aesthetic of the comic is now slick, glossy Matrix-styled Hollywood. Even if you haven't read the comics, this movie is lacking in the way it tries to be subversive by hitting you over the head with it's morality. When it begins to become thought-provoking, rather than let you form your own opinion, it blatantly shows you the way. This could have been done in a much more subdued manner, rather than as an action movie with high-end special effects.",

882,20 March 2006,lavellen,9, V for Libertie,"What a moment it is for me to go into a superhero movie and find a fine film. The Characters of V for Vendetta are brought to life in their full comic audacity by Portman and Weaving. The story unfolds in Fascist England which is under the rule of a religious zealot in the style of Nazi Hitler. As the story line progresses the incredible liberal agenda of the Wachowski brothers shines through making this film hard to swallow for those conservative members of the audience (One man sitting behind me in the theater said, ""What is this, Brokeback Vendetta?""). Overall, the bloodshed and Violence are brief and make this an okay film for the teenager who's parents are willing to watch, and the film's formal elements are absolutely fantastic. If this weren't based on a character I would criticize some of the obsessive use of theatrical rhetoric from the V character, but Hugo pulled it off, and this film is a must see for those of us who accidentally watched 'Electra' hoping for 'X-Men' or 'Batman'.",

There are those who secretly oppose their government's excessive control of individual rights and freedoms. However there is one who begins to champion those rights -- V. V is played with exquisite eccentricity, while Evey's role was more subtle yet sublime. The supporting cast was on point as well. The action, though robust, was not overwhelming. Though politically charged -- it was not nuanced with propaganda. This film challenged the viewer to examine the notions of liberty, power and loyalty and by what means would some go to protect those values -- and to what end.",

Sure the dialogue comes out like it's written and doesn't seem natural, but than again this takes place in the future. So the plot is this, there is this character V that fights for justice and freedom even if he has to get his hands dirty. And is labeled as a terrorist while he tries rise up against a totalitarian government. Than he meets Evey played by Natalie Portman that is a witness of V's doings. And V has big plans that leads up to the 5th of November. Agent Smith I mean Hugo Weaving was perfect for this role as V, he played it in a very charming and charismatic manner that is believable. This movie simply had style, substance and intelligence thanks to the excellent writing by Alan Moore. Sure the movie has some parts where it isn't fully explained and doesn't make sense sometimes but those are very few and the direction it goes makes it forgivable.

They have a conservative government that bases it's power around religion, security where everyone is watched upon 24/7, minorities are removed from the streets and peoples rights are strictly restricted. This is what the conservative sides of the government and people are all about if things go in the worst way possible. What conservatives don't want to see is that this is where their ideas could lead to and this is something the American government is slowly moving towards. The direction is great and the actors do a good job. The movie isn't very action oriented which is just fine because it doesn't need lots of fighting to work.

The movie starts off with a young lady walking alone at night, however there is a curfew and she was captured by 3 members of the government in a dark alley. Then like most typical action movies someone always saves the beautiful woman from the bad guys. Well, the main character, V, appears and saves the woman. The woman falls for V and V also falls for the woman himself. There is much more, However, I do not want to ruin the rest of the movie for you. This is a must see movie, if you haven't seen it already, then i suggest you rent it or even buy it.",

Thinking back to the horrible movies such as ""Fantastic Four"", ""Batman and Robin"", or even ""Daredevil"", I sure am glad that we have movies like ""Batman Begins"", ""Xmen"" (and ""X2""), ""Sin City"", and now ""V for Vendetta"" to balance things out! Out of all the good comic movies, the topic that ""V for Vendetta"" explores is the most profound, deep, and frightening. ""Xmen"" comes close with its topics, but ""V for Vendetta"" brings it up a notch and shows you a world where everything goes wrong and Hitler like maniacs have used fear to create a totalitarian state. The movie explores everything from fear-based politics to terrorism to propaganda to government conspiracy to vigilantes to the true meaning of patriotism to love to revenge to prejudice and racism, all in a very coherent story line and all portrayed very well.",

The dialogue is smart. I have seen so many action movies where the dialogue is dull and this is not one of them. The action is sensible and clean. No gratuitous violence, which is refreshing. I do not even know if I would call it an action movie. It is a movie about human nature, about government, about oppression, and about freedom. It shows the viewer what is important.

I understand how V's mask plays an important role in the graphic novel, but on screen, honestly, it's just annoying, and it limited Hugo Weaving's acting so much that I'm surprised he merited a screen credit (sorry Hugo). Perhaps the Orwellian England where the story takes place is more interesting for those who haven't read Orwell. One thing that was very interesting to me, though, was the perspective on London's famous public camera scrutiny. I've always wondered what sort of end result that social experiment would have.

It's definitely a provocative and interesting movie, but unlike any comic book movie I've ever seen. I appreciated its originality and authenticity. It's a fantastic visual experience, and heavily stylized. It also had me thinking about it after it was over, so that means it was a very effective movie. I wouldn't exactly say I enjoyed it though. It's a bit too heavy-handed and dark for my liking. The leads are not your typical heroes either. They are very much the definition of anti-heroes. Hugo Weaving is not exactly very sympathetic as V. He does things a hero shouldn't do, and that's what made him so fascinating. He is filled with regret, remorse, and pain. His chemistry with Portman is what really made this movie. Weaving was excellent, but it's Natalie Portman who deserves the most praise. Her character goes through many stages of emotions, and she nailed every one of them with perfection. Her transformation in the second half speaks volumes about her range as an actress. I adored her. Stephen Rea is very good as well as the relentless detective who uncovers how corrupted the government is becoming. It does have some scintillating action scenes, but it's more about character development than anything else. ",

That's the question that V for Vendetta proposes, and not only does it present the question, it answers it, and paints a picture so vividly and frightening, unlike anything you have ever seen before. Hugo Weaving plays V, an enigmatic man who wears a mask of Guy Fawkes, who we see saving Evey Hammond from some corrupt policemen who mean to rape her.

Your attention easily drifts from the screen: the production values are weaker than most US TV shows, the casting is poor, the script is over wordy and there are ridiculous plot inconsistencies, a primary character wears a mask ..... and the explosive ending is given away by the trailer. That said, the ending is the best part of an otherwise forgettable fiasco. A large chunk of the script is given over to an anarchist wearing a Fawkes mask, who singlehandedly plans the destruction of the high tech government of a totalitarian, manipulative, surveillance ridden, future UK. Another chunk of script is given to his pursuer, a policeman played unconvincingly by Stephen Rea. One plot point involves a renegade TV host departing from script to lampoon the totalitarian government - we are expected to believe that such a hi-tech 'eyes and ears' government would wait until after the show had aired in it's entirety before taking action against the TV host.

The visual imagery is rather striking if sometimes overtly symbolic. Portman turns in a fine performance as a young woman who becomes allied with V, the masked man.

Her parents were freedom fighters and were killed when she was very young. In a chance encounter one night with some ""finger men"" (England's brutal police force), she is rescued by the vigilant ""V"", only to watch him in his first terrorist attack on corrupt England. Video surveillance shows her at the scene of the crime, and shortly thereafter she is wanted for arrest. In his second act of terrorism, ""V"" shows up at Evey's job, where she subsequently saves him from a policeman, after which she is knocked unconscious. Then and there ""V"" makes the decision to take her with him, and so begins her life altering course. She becomes unafraid, unwaivering, and under the spell of the valiant ""V"". The story plays out, and I'll leave the rest for you to see at the movies. ""V for Vendetta"" is grasping from beginning to end. It is a rather long movie, but not once in the whole film is there a time when the movie-goer thinks, ""I wish this would just end already."" It literally keeps you locked from beginning to end.

Hugo Weaving did a great role choice to be V he also made the character believable. I loved V for Vendetta in the theaters and can not wait to own it at home. It was a well thought out film that has an edge and was very serious about what the world can become. I knew that this movie was going to be good once I found out a little bit of background about it but I had no idea it was going to be as good as it was. More movies should take the approach of V for Vendetta because it had great screen shots, once again dialog, and a unique story line.

Not only the action, but the plot was lacking as well. There was no real resolution in the end of the film, specifically when the audience is never told who ""V"" really is, and how he became such a skilled ""terrorist"".

It is up to us to recognize the V in us. While he uses a mask to reveal his true nature, we use our own faces to hide ours! Our faces are but masks...about time we changed that! And Hugo Weaving's V really comes alive and stands larger than life! And to think Weaving accomplishes all that without ever using an actor's greatest tool, his face!

But the flaws, those ugly flaws that drag it down, ever so slightly but just enough to rip it from the grip of perfection. Lets start with the director who never makes any real commitment to particular style for the film; he seems torn between getting the idea across and making it appealing to a mainstream audience. The script also suffers the same flaws, adding a sense of humour and personality to the main character yet expecting him to be seen as an Idea not a man. It tries to be dark, to be all about the idea, but it also wants to hit the mainstream audience, and yes it does this, and yes it gets the message across, however, it also looses some of its power in doing so. This film is not bold, exciting, and inventive. The ideas are there but it still persists in following the old, going with what has worked before and will work again, the main goal is to make money, and it's this business focus that stops it from being a giant, that stops it from being something truly special. It's through experimentation the Matrix redefined cinema, V for Vendetta is afraid to do so, it's afraid of failure in the mainstream and so it is just another Matrix influenced action film, and a good idea. However it isn't bad, it just doesn't meet its potential.

970,1 March 2008,darknight-13,7, A Tragic Waste,"Based on the 1980s graphic novel by Alan Moore, ""V for Vendetta"" had tremendous potential: A fabulous source book, top-notch actors, and brilliant directors. And then they blew it. The graphic novel, which was more libertarian than liberal, was very even minded, not truly siding with either point of view. It contrasted two extremes: anarchism and fascism, and let the reader decide which was preferable. Most importantly, it was most definitely about England, not America. This was their first mistake. They changed the plot to appeal to modern audience, but what they ended up doing was injecting US politics into a British story. Not nearly as even minded either, the film completely sides with the title character, who has gone from a libertarian anarchist to a liberal revolutionary. Worse still the plot line's back story is now a thinly veiled analogy of the 9/11 attacks though the eyes of conspiracy theorists. A tragic waste, considering the film's good points. The acting was phenomenal, especially Hugo Weavings, had to do the entire film masked, depriving him of the benefit of facial expression. The special effects were impressive too, reminiscent of the Wachowski Brothers work in ""The Matrix"". Unfortunately all this is lost in the poor storyline, which reduces this potentially operatic masterpiece to a sloppy political satire.",

976,30 March 2023,Holt344,10," V for Vendetta is a well crafted and gritty dystopian film with a political story, it has a stellar cast and most importantly, it's cinema - My Ultimate Review","It was actually a long time ago since I watched V for Vendetta, but here we are multiple years later and with the preferred version or so I've read, the 4k blu-ray version. It was directed by James McTeigue (in his feature directorial debut) whilst the screenplay was written by the Wachowskis who also produced the film. What's so interesting about McTeigue is how he was an assistant director on many films; including Dark City, the Matrix trilogy and Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones. All five I like. With his work and relationship with The Wachowskis, I can understand why they placed their trust on him, his direction and visual storytelling is perfect and he did create a great adaption. This was the last film Adrian Biddle worked on before his death and as always, his cinematography is stunning and brilliant. The film just looks incredible, with its stellar production and art design, there were so many talented people working on this film. The editing is truly fantastic, Martin Walsh did some award worthy work on this film, without a doubt one of the highlights. Dario Marianelli's musical score is perfect and powerful. The Dolby Atmos track for the 4k blu-ray was spectacular and so was the picture quality. One thing that I really find interesting, more now than last time I watched it, is how the film adopts extensive imagery from the 1605 Gunpowder Plot, in which a group of Catholic conspirators plotted to destroy the Houses of Parliament in order to spark a revolution in Great Britain. I actually think this film works better on a rewatch as V for Vendetta is extremely detailed. There's a lot of things I liked more this time around than before, the political story, the storytelling used there are so good and is the reason why some of the actors wanted in on the project, and that's completely understandable as the political allegory is brilliant which makes for such a more realistic and interesting story.",

V played by William Rookwood is superbly articulate man who wants revenge on everyone that made him the way he is today. He wears a mask throughout the whole film, and although you never see his face it won't stop you from feeling every emotion he feels. He refers to ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" repeatedly which gives a lot of incite to what he is feeling and how obsessed and driven by vengeance he is.

This film is a Action, Superhero, mystery, and comic book movie rolled up into one. Unlike so many other films put out today, this is a very intelligent & thoughtful action movie.

They do not do this with a heavy hand but the connection is, nevertheless, clear. This makes the ending so much more cathartic. We never see Hugo Weavings face, but his strong voice dominates throughout. His character is not Neo for so many reasons. For one, he quotes Shakespeare and is not seeking an answer, but delivering one. The Main Stream Media have been screaming for days about how this is a movie about terrorism and they are right, but not in the way they would have us believe. It shows how a people were lied to and based their decisions on those lies. The Media, of course, is in lock-step with the Administration and work hand-in-hand with them to maintain a high level of terror to maintain control and power over the populace. John Hurt is especially good as High Chancellor Stutler and is so rabid in his need to dominate and control that he reminds one of many WWII German speeches, whether given by Hitler or one of his henchman. Guy Fawkes was an excellent choice for V, both as a mask and a day for awakening and action. Although V has his own personal agenda, he has lost his identity and found redemption in the same flames that were started and fanned by Chancellor Stutler and his cronies. I recommend this film to everyone, it carries a strong emotional and intellectual message and should be seen.",

It seems this movie can't decide whether it wants to have a message or just a mockery of that same message. I'm not familiar with the graphic novel this is based on, which means I can't tell if it's originally serious or humorous in tone. The movie, however, is neither serious nor funny, while trying to be both. Take the protagonist and the cop...the jokes don't work and often aren't appropriate. There is no acting for V to speak of, since he is more or less only voiced and the cop (Stephen Rea) is awfully wooden which makes about 90% of the - minimalistic - dialog pain to sit through. Many other characters are overdrawn in comparison - OK, it's based on a comic, but anyway - which doesn't work (for me).",

1002,21 May 2006,adamnad-1,1, Average Movie. Substantial for a Comic Book,"V for Vendetta. Is an e enjoyable and sometimes irritating film. The film is full of substance for a comic book. The movie spends a great deal of time showing us the Fascist Totalitarian State of Britain and it captures it quite well. The movies politics are a major hindrance however and little insulting. The Christian Bishop is a pedophile and ex military commander and Stephen Fry's character calls the Koran beautiful. The movie could have done without those two scenes. The movie is certainly light on logic as V is easily able to get at his enemies in a totalitarian state! Natalie Portman gives a crappy performance and is not believable as British. Her accent and acting are poor. I think Keira Knigtley would have worked much better in the role. The supporting cast of Oscar Nominees Stephen Rea and John Hurt are largely wasted. The character of V is very derivative and echos a little bit Phantom of the Opera, Zorro, Man of La Mancha, and little bit of the architect from the Matrix sequels. The direct and script are sometimes poor as the action and story are less than impressive. The film has some great moments is often preposterous largely thanks to a heavy handed script and equally heavy handed direction. End result 5/10 Average. Not worthy of the Top 250.",

It manages to be moving without being sentimental, and brings up interesting topics without being judgmental. Hugo Weaving turns in a fantastic performance just with his voice and body language, and Natalie Portmann is appropriately fragile and strong. And certainly, it was unavoidable to feel moved and roused by the ending, that promises better things but doesn't necessarily guarantee it. Overall, I found this to be a smart, non-preachy film that's highly entertaining and moving at the same time as highlighting those questions that should asked.",

It's a good looking and stylish film and it has a very original plot and ideas. The film is entertaining and eventually starting to draw me into the film more and more. The film is classy and stylish and has lots of great atmosphere and some good action sequences that feel like this is almost a comic book come to life.

It is also highly literate with constant allusions to and quotations from classic writers (especially Shakespeare). Here are some of the points to ponder: 1. What does the mask represent? Is it V's persona as a terrorist? Is it to make him an abstraction or an embodied idea? Or an Everyman?

The dialogue is cheesy and ridiculous, the acting is mostly bad (which is odd, because the cast was generally pretty good) and the script appears to have been written by someone who only skimmed the Wikipedia page of the original comic. I bet even the catering sucked. The movie decides to change the title character, ""V"" into a liberally biased hero. This seems fine, until you remember that he is a psychotic anarchic, terrorist. In fact his political beliefs seem to be the only thing in keeping him in the right, since he probably kills even more people than in the comic, due to the film's complete lack of subtlety, which it also demonstrates by hitting you over the head with the Anti-Bush themes (how exactly does Iraq end in a nuclear war again?)that they had to completely change the setting and premise to squeeze in. This movie is so full of explosions, it might as well be from Michael Bay. In fact, he'd probably do a better job. Most of the other characters are different too; the 16 year old prostitute is now just some random lady who works in the TV studio, her love interest is now gay, so they can shove in a creepy and unnecessary romantic subplot between her and V, the radio announcer is now a British caricature of Glenn Beck, and the dictator goes from being one of the most interesting characters to a cartoon super villain. The worst part is the addition of a virus subplot, meaning the entire population is actually hateful of the government and sympathetic towards V. This is all build-up to the retarded finale which makes no sense at all, and happens to be exactly the opposite of how the comic ends. I would tell you what happens, but it's so thoroughly ridiculous, you have to see it for yourself. Or better yet, don't, because no matter what the rating says, this movie is bad.",
1021,18 March 2021,meydiana-65242,10, Truly Unique,"There are some that will, upon seeing this film, say that it was akin to Andrew Lloyd Weber attempting to make a political statement: overly dramatic. These people would be well served to remember that the symbol of drama is a mask, which certainly begs one important question- Why, if you are so put off by an overtly dramatic motion picture, would you choose to see a movie that stars as the (anti)hero a man in a mask? I just saw this film at an advanced screening and I must say it is nothing short of uniquely brilliant. Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio-political message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure.",

1023,30 August 2006,rebeljenn,8," classic, creative, original","'V For Vendetta' is a film set in the future where the world behaves strikingly similar to the film '1984' with a corrupt and controlling government and ruler placing bans on human freedoms. Among the chaos is a hero dressed symbolically as Guy Fawkes who wishes to bring down the government. In a chance of fate, he meets Evie, and her life changes while she is thrown into a series of events that pull her in his direction. The film is a masterpiece combining an engaging storyline, unique characters and character development, and detailed cinematography to capture the different moods and atmospheres of the oppressed society.

1025,25 March 2006,guslinton,9, The right movie at the right time,"V for Vendetta is a comic book style allegorical thriller. Although the setting is England, the film is really about what is happening in present day America, and what the rest of the world will be like in twenty or so years given current political trends. America has already collapsed, and the UK is in the grip of a neo-con dictatorship that has risen to power by creating high level of fear and religious faith in the population, while at the same time pumping them with high tech propaganda. The dictatorial coup is initiated by the ruling elite executing a false flag attack on their own people. Vendetta is a remake of ""1984"" in the context of the Bush administration. It alludes to 911 and anthrax attacks, the Patriot Act, Abu-ghraib, the fearful and passive American public and its corrupt, greedy, and even evil government and much more. But you can also enjoy this film simply as a futuristic thriller, fast moving with excellent special effects and some violence. Neither the effects nor the violence is overdone. Direction, acting, and writing are also good. There are a lot of good literary quotations and memorable speeches. At one point V says, ""The artist lies to reveal the truth; the politician lies to conceal the truth."" The movie is worth seeing on a lot of different levels.",
1026,20 March 2006,gaz_savage,5, Distinctly Average,"I think that V for Vendetta is over rated I think if it was done by anyone other than the wachowski brothers it wouldn't have even made it to cinema.....The storyline is good its an idea that hasn't been touched on but the execution is what let it down. Agent Smith plays a good part in this film as ""V"" but I don't think is supported by his fellow actors, Natalie Portman should be shot for her ""English Accent"" as most of the time I thought she was either from South Africa or France.... y wasn't keira Knightley used for this part she is exactly the same just English. The film also hung on way ""V"" wanted to get back at the Government they could of explained the whole story in one line... instead we were subjected to lots of boring scenes which led nowhere but to the point we had already heard over and over again.... I think Stephen Fry played a very good part and his acting saved the film slightly....Overall I gave this film 5/10 for the boredom I was forced to sit through",

This is not your typical adventure and/or action movie.

It is a movie filled with depth, beautiful story, well executed timing, great dialogue, great action and interesting characters.

1035,3 September 2020,mfellipecampos,7, Good,"Certainly the most courageous post 9/11 work that Hollywood has ever produced. Generally, when we discuss ideologically multifaceted films such as V for Vendetta, expert critics and film buffs forget the shades of gray and go into irrational discussion. So before going into more detail in the film, I will try to elucidate some themes that took the debates around this work. Well, V for Vendetta is based on the comic of the same name created by Alan Moore. Unlike the HQ on which it is based, launched in the 1980s with clear allusions to Margaret Thatcher's management, when England was overtaken by strikes and demonstrations from all parts of civil society, the film is set in a dystopian future (I suppose that somewhere in the mid-20s or 30s of the 21st century) where the United Kingdom is dominated by an authoritarian government led by folkloric Adam Sutler (played by a possessed John Hurt) who rose up in the midst of a supply crisis in the country, along with heavy economic depression and political corruption. As in Moore's work, the anarchic tone is strongly present in the film, anarchism personified in the figure of V, a former prisoner of concentration camps that the government built to carry out genetic experiments with the so-called ""unwanted"" (homosexuals) , blacks, Muslims and other minorities). If I start to stick to the various geo-political, philosophical and historical themes covered here, I would undoubtedly spend days and days writing this review. What makes this work so sensational is precisely the ease with which the Wachowski brothers' minimalist script unravels such complex and pertinent themes today. The refined direction of the then newcomer James McTeigue, who surprises with stylized plans and electrifying action sequences, highlighting the already classic '' Now is my turn '' in the third act of the plot. Obviously, the film does not escape from some silly mistakes that end up disturbing the final result, such as the change that the Wachowski script makes in the relationship between V and Evey (played with absolute depth by Natalie Portman, who by the way looks beautiful even bald ), while the adaptation gets it right by increasing Evey's relevance in the plot, they make a mistake in calling for a brief, unnecessary romance between Evey and V. The supporting cast is also very well selected, while Stephen Rea almost steals the show as the reluctant Detective Finch, Stephen Fry is not left behind like the amusing Gordon, although his character is underdeveloped (they could have gone a little deeper into the issue of closeted homosexuality and government repression against minorities, another negative point of the film) the comedian surprises and even shows dramatic talent. V for Vendetta is not a work of easy digestion, although sold as a commercial, studio film. Incidentally, we have to give credit to Warner Bros Pictures, which occasionally releases challenging films on the market. A silly little mistake or another prevents ""Vendetta"" from being a complete, excellent work, but it certainly deserves to be seen, and let us not forget to reflect on the topics covered throughout its delicious 133 minutes. Enjoy the good action scenes and enjoy the stunning visuals, please don't forget your brain.",

The first half of the film I thought that maybe it is just some kind of set up...that the plot will dramatically change, but unfortunately it didn't. So the second half of the movie I was just waiting for it to end. Really awful movie. Cheap and stupid! Can't understand it that somebody liked it. The whole story is really very bad. I really didn't get it what it was supposed to be about. Guy Folks or what his name is? He was supposed to be the chosen mask of the main character in the film...why him,don't ask me. I do not particularly like sci-fi but there are some exceptions like Fifth element of 12 monkeys...but this one?! It was just so unreal.

1039,18 March 2006,kmukh_73,10," V4V is a Awesome, simply Brilliant","One can't ask for more of the Moore's adaption to a movie, V4V. Director James McTeigue comes with another masterpiece after MATRIX. And Natalie Portman (along with a stellar supporting cast of Stephen Rea), comes out with another brilliant performance after CLOSER. This is a movie about REVOLUTION that might come in future years, but whatever it is, it was a revelation of the 2006 movies. This is the same time as CRASH hit the theaters last year, and I would be surprised if this film is not nominated for OSCARS'07! I won't go into the storyline, as many of comments had already posted a brief outline of the movie. But the essence of the story is: A day is near when common people are going to revolt against the government, someone somewhere is just yet to arrive to hold the torch of the Revolution. The film compares everything, starting from Hitler's attitude to modern day's HITLERs out there (almost in every continent)! It also projects the diseases conquering the world (from Avian Flue, deadly viral disease etc). It reflects the war within us, the war of power-frenzy humans against the weaker ones and against the common people. Essentially the movie relates the saga of human life in the 21st century is the same as it was in 20th century, nothing different, only more sophisticated. A must watch. It left me spellbound, hope it will cast a same effect on you too.",

It is a story of ideas, filled with rich language and subtle nuances. It has iconic imagery and liberal use of symbolism. It presents deep political arguments and moral ambiguity. The film captures most of these themes, but in a more compact and simplistic version. It is faithful to segments of the story, but drastically alters the course of the tale.",

THe movie has it all for me, humor-poetry-drama-mystery-great music-action and v strong acting. I just love Stephen Fry, ever since I saw Wilde he's been one of my favorite actors. HUgo Weaving as well, what a difficult part. how do you show emotions with a mask. What an amazing actor. Even the little girl did v well. The movie was v 1984 but with wit and romance (which was sometimes a bit weird and in a way not really necessary for the story). THe fight scene at the end was also a bit over the top and you can clearly see some Matrix features in it but the death scene and the scene with all the guy Fawkes'masks make you quickly forget those minor slips. the blowing up of parliament was an amazing scene.

Don't get me wrong V for Vendetta is a pretty good movie; it's smart, thought-provoking, exciting and makes for a great conversation starter. But to me the Wachowski Brothers did tinker quite a bit with the graphic novel, in some ways good, and in some ways very bad. But even with those changes I still rather enjoyed my time at the movies.

If you want action, too bad; ""V for Vendetta"" has hardly any, and what's there is mindless and mediocre. Not even cool, and nothing like the Matrix.

The plot is different, makes people think and provides good plot, characters and action. Altho bits from the comic, I feel, could have been introduced into the film. Like Dominics transformation to the new role of V leading the people of London. Perhaps they felt they should not corrupt the film with a sequel, I know that Alan Moore the original writer was unimpressed with the film project and left, so perhaps it was in kindness to him. I think it is ignorant to pick up the small things in the film that are perhaps wrong. I see people writing about how people in the UK never say elevator, course they do, just because you don't say it. Hugo Weaving as the lead role does seem to suit him, his voice is superb, but still it would be interesting to see how James Purefoys voice would have sounded behind the mask. Natalie Portmans acting was also very good, I can see where people are coming from on her accent but she still did a good job, portraying emotions. Just my thoughts!",

John Hurt (1984) is no stranger to this sort of science fiction tale and never let's his acting go over the top.

1068,22 June 2006,aliceboy,6, An embarrassment to its creator,"In spite of myself, I was completely geeked up about the movie adaptation of one of my favourite comics. I can only blame this on a very effective advertising campaign (the site was neat, the retro design on the posters very attractive and news on the movie hard to come by), since every prior Alan Moore adaptation has suffered horribly at the hands of Hollywood. In addition to which was the directorial debut of an AD from such abominations as the 'Star Wars' prequels and 'The Matrix' trilogy. Still, despite these warning signs, when it was finally time for the movie, I was quite excited. (Regrettably, it was only after seeing it that I heard Moore had disowned the project!) Knowing I'd most likely be disappointed, though, I tried to separate the film from its original source material (which it almost entirely betrays, for some reason) and view it simply as a sci-fi action movie (which I'd almost never watch otherwise). I know: impossible, right? I thought I could do it, and I don't know if I was up to the task. I'll concede that Hugo Weaving was an apt choice for V. He does a nice job with a difficult character, only occasionally descending to hamminess. I was curious to see what Natalie Portman would do with Evey, and was completely let down. She was entirely too attractive for the role of Little Miss Average, and I can never accept her all-too-subtle English accent (this was supposed to be a lower middle class girl, after all, and she plays it like she went to Oxford). I understand that, in order to have an almost all-English cast, the filmmakers had to score some American star power, but surely there could have been someone else (was Jena Malone busy?). McTeigue's direction is all you'd expect it to be: effects heavy and lacking moving artistic perception. I imagine this film looks great in stills, and that's how he (and his mentors the Wachowskis) sets up shots: as images, not as motion. So much of the camera-work -- to say nothing of the effects -- was gratuitous and done solely for 'wow-factor' in a story that would otherwise have been too quite for the mythical American audience to handle. That, it seems, is at the root of the problem with this film: it was engineered, once again, for the eternally underestimated American filmgoing audience. So often, Hollywood betrays sharp original material in pursuit of what is desired by a fictitious audience it's created itself. This only results in the worst kind of movies, and 'V for Vendetta' is a perfect example of this. The original material was fine, and probably as close as Alan Moore will ever have gotten to a made-for-film comic. All it would've taken to make it filmable was to excise some of the enriching subplots (the doctor's story, the homelives of the party members, the 'Evita' style power grab by the wife) and shooting what was left. And it comes close here, but just has to monkey with it. In the end, this was an attractive movie for a dumbed-down audience. I'm constantly shocked by how many people who've read the original book think this is a good adaptation. The movie takes the basic material and ruins it, so I really think it should only be considered on its own. Even in that light, however, this clunker falls flat. Nice mask, though...",

I didn't like the story and the acting of the movie. This could have been a lot better if it was just like the original Guy Fawkes story. I didn't like the character V in the movie I thought he sucked. I gave it 3 because the acting of Natalie Portman was pretty good. She was the only thing I liked in the film. Natalie had good acting but the support wasn't good at all. The film could have had better dialogoues which it didn't. I felt very bored while watching this film.

Each episode seems like it has no relation with the previous episode, which basically means you can start the movie from any place and still understand it all. Awful plot. All time along I had no interest in what's going to happen next. Zero action. There was only that blah blah blah and nothing else.Directing sucks. You know, sometimes you watch the movie and you even say ""nice directing"" because the director tried and made the viewing of the movie alone - interesting. That surely was not the case with VfV. All he did was switch from cam A to cam B. You know, it's like in photographing business, there's that golden section rule. If a photo is made by following this rule, then even a simple photo will look attractive, and the magic is that golden section. In movies, there has to be some other magic, and some directors use it, and some DON'T, like the director of ""V for Vendetta""! And OMG how I regret I spend my time on it. Don't believe the 8+ rating, it's not worth even a round 5!! I gave it a well-deserved and earned 1 (one). I felt with my guts that this would be a crap movie, and it really was. Sorry but it's plain truth.",

1075,18 March 2006,ExpendableMan,9, And the frozen mask just smiles,"How do you go about adapting one of the greatest comic books in history without alienating the long time fans who've worshipped the pages it's printed on since day one? This is a question that has to have troubled Hollywood execs a lot given the number of comic-to-movie conversions in the past few years, but the pressure must have really been on for the Wachowskis when making V For Vendetta. The original graphic novel is an adult oriented title about a masked madman terrorising a futuristic fascist England written during the Thatcher era and as such is bristling with political vitriol and a twisty-turny plot packed with intricate detail, lovingly crafted with such passion it has become one of the industry's most hallowed titles. Thus, it is a tremendous relief to say that after the disaster of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and the ""I can't believe this is based on the comic"" misfire of From Hell that writer Alan Moore has finally had a work translated perfectly to the screen, even if he did insist on having his name removed from the credits.",

She works at a news broadcasting studio and one night she gets attacked by some men. To her rescue comes V a man who wears a mask and rescues her from being raped. The movie starts here and only gets better. The plot is about a man V who wants revenge on everyone who hurt him years ago. Natalie Portman is such a good actress and this movie shows it.

V for Vendetta explores an England of the near future, that isn't a far stretch from the political climate we currently live in. It exposes the fine line between government policy and government fallacy. It inspires and restores faith in the power of people whose governments no longer serve their interests (a plot point that hits too close to home for this writer's likening, at all levels of government). All the while, the film manages to entertain, intrigue, and enlighten us at the same time.",

1081,19 August 2015,gheremond,10, Remember remember...,The Matrix trilogy may have backfired miserably. But at least the Wachowskis gave the opportunity to McTeigue to make a movie that is as uncompromising and provoking as the graphic novel it was based on. It actually makes one wonder how a movie like this ever got out of a major studio. Maybe there is still hope. In the mean time Natalie Portman finally shines as she hasn't in a long long time and Hugo Weaving is unrelenting as the enigmatic V. The biggest selling point is that this isn't a superhero. You never see him performing some impossible feat. Listening to V talking about what destroying buildings means will send a chill down your spine. Powerful ideas make for powerful films.,

I would rate it at least a 7 if I hadn't found it, in the end, morally objectionable. In the end it is a nihilist production (very like 'The Matrix', come to think of it) which exists to damp down and defuse all thoughts of current politics and political action in the minds of those who watch it.",
1083,19 March 2006,mtmartinelli,10, Excellent in every way,"If you are having doubts about this movie, I highly suggest overcoming them. I had expected it to be an action movie cashing in on the political anarchy theme in the shallowest of way. After seeing that it had led the box office all weekend, I gave it a shot. I was definitely happy with my decision. The movie contains a deep and complex story of a futuristic Britain, lending to political satire of current leadership as well as fully developed characters. The plot never had a dull moment and no holes to count. Also, the action was exciting in the style of the first matrix. Rarely does an action movie invoke so many different emotions. The witty comedy, well written screenplay, deep sympathy for the characters, and flashy action comes together in a way no other movie has in quite some time.",
1084,28 March 2006,gigioiaderosa,9, No words to describe the magnificence of this movie!!,"Natalie Portman; Hugo Weaving; The Wachowski Bros., Owen Patterson. The crew is almost the same of Matrix, so there were two actual possibilities: a) this movie could be a special-effect whipped 'thing', of which I could get bored after 15 minutes; b) a masterpiece. Good Luck, we're in the second case!!! Now, I've seen a lot of movies about heroes, and beautiful and fragile girls, but this one . . . Hugo Weaving, 'V' for friends, made this incredible performance with the mask on for the whole film! Kinda makes you wander 'And what if he didn't use it? Would he have been nominated for the 2007 Academy Awards? 'V' is this almost-19th-century hero, actually living in the 21st century, and he's fighting against the system (against the London then-dictator; we're around 2030). He meets this girl,Evey, saving her from a potential multiple rape (transforming it into a multiple murder via stab wounds), and he also falls in love with her. On the other hand, Evey, which isn't pretty much interested in someone who kills people with the smile on the face (litterally), bit by bit gets rid of her fears and, at the very end, she falls in love for V-guy. All this stuff is merged with a certain dark-cyberpunk atmosphere, but less technological than 'Matrix', so that you can feel all the poetry of the main character . . . between a stab and a kick, of course!!",

But Britain has a secret weapon to fight back against the government to win back control over their lives. His name is Agent Codename: V and he will soon have a new ally named Evie Hammond. What a story. The special effects are amazing and the story is fascinating. The story goes like this: A shadowy freedom fighter known only as V fights for the rights of the people in Britain by blowing up powerful landmarks in Britain and 1 night he rescues a women, Evie Hammond from the secret Police and locks her down in his domain to mold her into his new ally. Over the course of 1 year, things change for Evie. Now I am an Independent voter but I discourage the way George W Bush is running things and that if we are not careful this is what could happen if the Bush's stay in Power. They will run our lives and their will be nothing that any of us can do about it. We are all seriously doomed if Bush stays in power.

Not over done, yet flow within and adding to the story line. Special effects were appropriate not over the top with people flying etc. I found the warnings against those who are bent on control without regard to their citizens are something that all people would do well to consider these include but are not limited to: one, that the government is to fear the people, not the people fear the government; two, That the evil rulers are the ones who would rather destroy a nation with disease or virus then steal their wealth, rather than through the use of a Nuclear War; third, the use of domestic violence is an effective means of population control; fourth, people are willing to give up their freedoms for safety provided by the government, as long as they do not know what is going on. It sounds so much like the Bush administration in the United States, I wonder if there was a message hidden here somewhere? This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time I have not tired of watching it again and again.",

1098,19 March 2006,jrlewis79,1, unmitigated crap and pure liberal propaganda,"If movies preach truthand, unfortunately, to so many people who see nothing else BUT truth when watching filmsthen apparently to have a conservative thought in your head is be equated with Hitler, to profess spiritual allegiance to the Church is to be a perverted pedophile, and to be a person of any sort of inspiration or consequence is to be gay (closet or open) or to break every rule of the book whenever you darn well please, killing whomever dares to rise against you, and inciting riots through your ill-placed, misguided message of anarchy in which who knows how many people ended up killing those around them in acting out their violence. That the film takes a shameless stance against the Church by depicting a perverted, lustful, pedophiliac bishop (oh, who's also apparently greedy and materialistic as we learned from his exorbitant salary) is merely the start of its ultra-liberal stance against anything traditional. Nevermind the fact that the Church here in America is already suffering from our own mistakes; go ahead and hit us when we're downthat's the message here. That the apparently ONLY way to be revered as a true hero and source of inspiration is to be of this ultra-liberal mindset, to take a purely anarchist stance against any form of authority, and to embrace alternative lifestyles as if to so is to be righteous and filled with virtuethis is the ultimate ""moral"" of this awful travesty called film. But God forbid that there be a movie made in which a conservativeeven a Catholic priestis depicted as the hero! And all of that is a critique only of the film's messageill-placed and misguided as it is. To critique the film's merits and qualities is another matter, and to start off my review there, it's simple: these supposed merits and qualities are nearly as bottom-feeding-trash as the message that is preached. First of all, clearly, the oppressive government is meant to be some sort of ""Big Brother"" a la 1984, and the Chancellor's rise to power is meant to be reminiscent of Hitler. Lest we have never read 1984 or have forgotten about Hitler's politics and insane social policies, every religion, including and, in some case, especially Catholicism suffered prejudice and persecution. In 1984, religion simply ceased to be (hm, sounds like the direction America's headed). Under Hitler, the Church's members suffered public humiliation, imprisonment, torture, and death (hm, sounds like America once again. I guess anti-Catholicism really is the last form of acceptable persecution in the U.S. After all, say or do anything disparaging against Judaism or Islam or Scientology or Latter-Day Saints, and you're prejudiced and should be shot on sight; do or so anything of the same sort against Catholics, and you're praised a hero. Hm. Can any sayHYPOCRISY?). And yet, in V, the ruling government embraces Catholicism as the only religion. It's tough to buy this government as truly a sort of ""Big Brother"" or Naziism with that sort of religious preference taking place amongst the government's ruling class. Secondly, what sorts of oppression did the film actually depict or even allude to? An imposed curfew, the banning of certain music and works of art, and discrimination against the hetero, Catholic ruling class. While this last point is never acceptable and is, in fact, horrifying to see in any society, fiction or not, the fact remains that oppressive governments in the past and today are far, far, far more oppressive even than this. The oppression depicted here is hardly extreme, and yet, V is apparently justified in destroying buildings like a maniac and killing people left and right. What was his true aim? He said that it was to free England from oppression. And yet, who were his victims? The people who were in charge of his imprisonment and torture. Is he, then, truly a savior for the common people, or is he merely just another psychopath bent on revenge? How can anyone find inspiration in that is beyond any rational thought. The one act of true heroics came and went when V saved Evey from the government agents, and at that point, he was expected to be some sort of Batman-like savior, fighting crime in the shadows of nightthat sort of thing. Does he ever do that again. Heck no. Instead, he's busy terrorizing society, prancing about with his sword to jazz music, and killing people in his madness for vengeance. Some savior! And the dialogueoh, where do I begin? The very first speech spoken by anyone just had to be by V, and was it any sort of inspirational monologue or even an explanation of why he does what he does? Absolutely not! It's a narcissistic flurry of V-words that talk only about who he is and why he's so great and why we should revere him. Wow, I bet that makes all of us wish to be so revered for being so selfish and crazy as a loon. The one quality that the film did have, I must admit, was the acting by the four principle actors: Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea, and John Hurt. Were it not for them, the film would be a complete failure rather than merely just rubbish. But such acting can be found elsewhere, in better movies, with better messages to preach, rather than in this tripe. See Brokeback for a gentler, more meaningful stance on the alternative lifestyles that are, in truth, oppressed by society. See Good Night and Good Luck for a far better film about an oppressive government leader and the fight against his self-righteous case. See V only if you want to see a freaky mask and a sample or two of pyrotechnics and special effects. Otherwise, don't see it at all.",

I have no negative criticisms about this film, and it is quite rewatchable. Plus it has an important message. John Hurt as the primary bad guy was a good bit of casting, and it is interesting to note that in this movie he is practically playing Big Brother and in ""1984"" he played Winston Smith. Hugo Weaving is great of course, despite his having to act behind a mask--a no doubt quite difficult task. Natalie Portman delivers a solid performance. Above par action in this movie, and impressive effects. Its positive reception and legacy are unsurprising. While this movie can't undo the failure of The Wachowskis' famous trilogy it, like the first ""Matrix,"" is a stellar addition to their oeuvre. Perhaps The Wachowskis will someday make a film I am interested in again. ""Remember, remember, the 5th of November...""",
1108,19 March 2006,skiggz,4, As Smug as the Titular V's Mask,"Thoroughly mediocre, V for Vendetta fails on all three levels. For some, it's a movie adaptation of a graphic novel, for others it's a political allegory, and for the rest of us it's an action flick. But in none of these areas does the film deliver $6's worth. The political commentary is bland and heavy-handed. Comparisons to the current GoP regime in America are plentiful and not in the least subtle. Its anti-establishment message could only offend if you hate sexy lesbians, and will only inspire if you think 9/11 was the result of an intricate government conspiracy.",

1110,20 June 2006,lavanyadmurthy,10, Excellent Dialoges,"The movie captured my imagination.Excellent movie! Worth every minute of your time. The dialogs grab your attention, especially from the character V. Hugo Weaving has given an Oscar-worthy performance, even with a mask on. Natalie Portman is stunning as ever, and has given an equally excellent performance. The movie without being too big on action scenes, delivers the idea of action very well. I especially loved the first set of dialogs between V and Eve, when every word V speaks begins with the letter 'V'. Hugo Weaving creates this mysterious, strong, and yet, sensitive personality in an unparalleled way. Excellent casting, cinematography and amazing sets. Amazing! Overall, an excellent watch. I know this movie is going in to my movie collection.",

It ruined an otherwise entertaining film and it's no wonder Alan Moore wants nothing to do with it. 
Sad. Stupid. I know there are people who hate art, but can't they sabotage it with a little more subtlety? If you're making a movie, inject your ideas by all means but don't make us gag on it.
Real modern governments and societies are imperfect systems with some good and some bad. Oh yeah, and you know it's okay to murder people cause they're Nazis. M'kay.

The creators of this film may have made suggestions pointing to that conclusion, be they unintentional or intentional (and I suspect they were intentional). Nothing could be further from the real truth. There are two points here. One, this is a revenge flick, Hence the title, V for Vendetta. And two, if there is any slap to be delivered here, it is against tyranny and dictators, such as Chairman Mao, Pol Pot, Tito, Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, Castro, Saddam, Ida Amin, Pinochet, Kim Jong II and countless other rulers who have cruelty exploited and brutally suppressed the masses in order to assume a totalitarian rule over a country (which also includes many of the Kings of England, France, and Russia). The themes of love, friendship, honor, justice, truth, devotion, and patriotism take a backseat. You may call them window-dressing, I would call them by-products.

I am aware that the author wasn't particularly happy with the way Hollywood treated his material but I have to say I felt this was an inspired piece of work. I'm not interested in the 'fanboy response' to how Alan Moore's work was treated, the script was true enough to his vision to get the important message across. Anything that can invoke the sort of dialogue I heard coming out of the cinema tonight can only be a good thing. Voter apathy/ignorance is the main reason the Americans have Bush as President, it's also the reason that the UK is America's lapdog at this time. This movie isn't a work of art, nor is it a particularly profound piece. However, what it IS is a wake up call for anyone who has lost interest in their Government's activity. I'm no activist but if ever there comes a time when the prevailing corruption and misinformation we're experiencing now comes to a head, as it does in THIS vision of dystopia, then I'll be the first to join the 'resistance'.

After I got over how amazing the film was (which took more than a few minutes) I asked myself why I thought it was so good. Performances were solid from every cast member. Natalie Portman was nothing short of amazing. Her transformation of character from the beginning to the end of the film was brilliant. Hugo Weaving as 'V' was also surprising. Because of the mask, all of his acting is done physically and with the voice. His performance was some of the best mask acting work I have ever seen (professional actors and acting teachers especially can appreciate the mask work). Not only did I understand his reasoning, but also even with the mask on, I was emotionally connected to him. This is partly due his performance, and partly due to the amazing writing. If you liked The Matrix Trilogy or have a love of politics or philosophy, see this film. Not only is this a great film, but also you will walk away thinking.",

1122,17 March 2006,thenametheyallfear,7, Hmmmmmmm.,"I just saw this film at the local cinema (was hoping to see it in IMAX, but for some reason the UK doesn't seem to be showing it in IMAX), and my final thoughts on the film are ""Hmmmmmmmmm."" With the Spider-Man films, I was a comic fan beforehand, and I loved the films all the same. I was quite familiar with X-Men, Hulk, so on, and I enjoyed those films too. The harder thing with V, which I finally read in October, is that it's a mini-series. One story. Thus, comic fans will notice the changes more. I've noticed the films been getting rave reviews in the States, and mixed ones in the UK. That's why I believe the film will perform better across the Atlantic. Profuro is a Hannity-alike, which will have American liberals jumping with glee, but will have most English people scratching their heads. It's just not quite what we're used to. The comments Alan Moore made here about ""eggy-in-a-basket"" still hold true, and I was tempted to walk out numerous times during the first half hour. There were some brilliant moments, even some surprisingly decent ones (the alliterative opening speech isn't that bad, thanks to Weaving's fine performance), but after the brilliant beginning explosion there's a great slump. Shouts of ""Bollocks!"" and numerous shots of people with bad teeth in pubs seem artificial and forced. Natalie Portman's accent does improve as the film goes on, and by the time we enter the Shadow Gallery (a beautiful set), things peak up again. The torture scene: brilliant. The flashbacks to Larkhill were haunting. Its just the odd flaws that stop this from being downright brilliant. To a US audience, these flaws will not be so apparent. I'm not US-bashing. I am Iranian, I've been brought up in England, and I love the States as well. I have family in Virginia, and when I come to visit I'm taken aback by people's kindness and generosity, as a lot of people here have a somewhat warped view. Tangent aside, it's just that these flaws may make the film hard-going for a British audience. I love Weaving's performance, but the early TV station speech was one too many, and too soon. V has won over the populace within the first 20 mins of the film. This leaves less of an arc for the rest, but still, the film prevails. The final explosion, even the infamous V army, is proof of what Hollywood does best. A Mesmerising Climax. If you're desperate for a star rating, I'd give it 4 out of 5. Star knocked off for the artificial Britishness. Two stars for the middle slump. But an extra star each for the wonderful domino montage, and the... I was going to say explosive, but... one extra star for the ending it is. A flawed film, but one worth seeing. I just fear that Saturday the 18th will be like any other day, and that copycat criminals will give the film, and V's cause, a bad name (the shoplifter in the film may be a sign of things to come). Partly I saw the film today for fear of a Clockwork-Orange style backlash in the UK. The hairs on the back of the necks of everyone in the cinema were on end when they saw that Tube train packed with explosives. Even I, who had already read the book and countless previews of the film, was taken aback. An Uncompromising, but flawed, Vision of the Future, indeed.",
1123,5 September 2011,JamesRutland,10, Dangerous... for politicians and their tyranny: REAL DEMOCRACY,"This movie is very dangerous because reveals a secret to people about what DEMOCRACY means and implies. First of all the movie investigates about a person, a strange individual with a mask... and people can ask: who is he? and why his mask? the answer is what realized ""V""... the evil of power and corruption of tyranny. Tyranny uses the propaganda to mask itself differently in confront of the community by which has legitimized itself. And that's the DECEPTION. What is the DECEPTION!? Some greedy individuals abuse of the power that own to PEOPLE. PEOPLE IS THE REAL POWER. So ""V"" will use the TV to remember the people what power really is, giving an appointment at V of November. Who is ""V"" really? ""V"" represents the power of people... he is not a terrorist at all, but he unveils the REAL TERRORIST which owns THE POWER (""because every terrorist is against DEMOCRACY and against people""). The female protagonist will reveal to attendances who ""V"" really is at the the end of the movie. The truth is that the power cannot be demanded to be Democracy, because DEMOCRACY IS THE POWER OF PEOPLE and without direct responsibility about this power, people cannot be FREE. This is ""V"". ""V"" is the IMPERIUM POTESTAS, the real power of humankind community. The truth is that without RESPONSIBILITY human beings cannot be free, every tyrant will mystify his imperium with the delegation replacing the will of people with its own will.

Disregarding the fact that it was americanised a bit compared to the comic book (which is so splendidly European), the movie is a must-see. The metaphores are great, so is the focus on Shakespeare and Goethe...the music is wonderful (from Beethoven to Tchaikovsky to Julie London) and just fits. Hugo Weaving is a god, and Portman is surprisingly good - better than I thought possible. If V wasn't played by Weaving, Evey would have stolen the show. I have only one problem with the film, and that is the following: why did the change the focus from anti-fascism to anti-conservativism. Because Moore and Loyd aimed it against Maggie Thatcher, you know? They had a very clear goal in mind when they set out to do what they did with ""V"".",

When I heard that they were making a film of ""V for Vendetta"", to say I was worried was putting it mildly. Especially when I heard that the Wachowski Brothers were helping out with it. Today proved me wrong and has restored my faith in comic-to-film movies. Being a major fan of the original comic, I found this movie faithful to the source and utterly brilliant. The cinematography was beautiful and the characters were all around wonderful. I especially enjoyed Hugo Weaving as the enigmatic V. He had the voice and the character that I imagined for the role and I was pleased with his performance. Natalie Portman's portrayal of Evey Hammond was nothing short of wonderful and the supporting cast, including Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, and the always brilliant John Hurt, were truly spectacular. For fans of big action and great characters, I highly recommend this film. Even for those who have not read the original comic, it will prove to be a visual treat and will keep you hanging on the edge of your seat right up until the ending credits.",
1128,19 March 2006,awmhill,10, When ideas become matter,"The Wachowski brothers accomplish yet another extraordinary commentary on society at large. Of course the film contains action and drama but without the emotional intensity of the Matrix. We knew that the heroin would be with us at the end of the film and overall there were little surprises with the direction of the plot. It was refreshing to see that the Wachowskis can have a flare for the dramatic as well as a solid, directional script that is still captivating. What was most compelling were the personal journeys of the characters whose past histories lead to present actions. While this scenario implies determinism, the film has a very clear focus that personal choice directs history. Without an antagonist or protagonist to focus on, the viewer is able to absorb the entirety of the film for a forceful message. Sentient beings are more than a body or a mind but an idea. An idea can bring about a catalyst for change that ordinary men wish only to study or follow. The father in the film turns himself into an idea to bring about redemption for those who wronged his family and a safer world for his child.",

Without a doubt one of the most significant political movies to come out of Hollywood in decades. Natalie Portman was a surprising choice and was well-suited to the role even though I originally had doubts after the wooden acting in the SW trilogy. For all of those out there who liked Hugo Weaving in his many roles he is perhaps at the apex of his game in this movie without ever once showing his face.

Natalie Portman is strong, thoroughly convincing in her role and quite frankly I thought she did an excellent job, I did not notice any issue with her accent, its a mix of English and American and thats just how it is, remember not every British person fits the stereotype.

Hugo Weavings's performance is nothing short of brilliant given that he only has his voice to work with. Natalie Portman's performance is equally believable in her transition from the beginning to the end of the movie and her fear is palpable during her captivity.

People say that Old School is this generations Animal House. If these are true then V For Vendetta is this generations A Clockwork Orange. By saying that I don't mean that we see people running around in long johns, and Derby hats raping women and beating people to death. It's just going to get that type of cult following. Some people might be turned off by the subliminal Bush bashing message hidden with in the film (After all it got the very attractive Natalie Portman, who is a very political activist to shave her head for the role of Evy) but other people will just enjoy the movie for what it is. Very entertaining. Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel, written about 20 years ago, V For Vendetta takes place in a futuristic London. Now by futuristic I don't mean flying cars and Jetson's type technology. The world of tomorrow in this film looks like the world of today. This London is run by a dictator of a man played by John Hurt. He tells people how they should, and will leave. We then meet Evy (Natalie Portman, Star Wars) who is caught by 'Fingermen"" (The government agents of London) because she is out past curfew. When she screams for help because the fingermen are going to have her do them ""favors"" for not getting in trouble, we then meet our hero V (Hugo Weaving, The Matrix, and Lord Of The Rings Trilogies). Now V isn't like your typical hero. He wears all black, has a pointy pilgrim hat and hides his face behind a mask that reminds me of The Joker. V seems borderline insane and Evy doesn't know exactly what to make of her strange knight in shining armor. Before she knows it, Evy has been dragged into V's one man war against the government. His modo is ""People should not be afraid of their government, government's should be afraid of their people. V For Vendetta will not cater to everyone (I did see this film with my wife, who hated it, and my two friends who liked it) but it will become a cult classic in the same vein as Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. People that have read Moore's brilliant graphic novel will love it as most of the film is scene for scene, word for word just like the book. Although Moore hated this film so much he did not want his name in the credits, which makes me wonder why? This was a far better adaptation than his last story come to life The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I admit I was nervous when I heard The Wachowski Brothers (The Matrix Trilogy) had wrote this film because while The Matrix was amazing, the follow up's were something to be desired for. Looks like they found what they were missing when they wrote Matrix 2 and 3. V For Vendetta is rated R for violence and language. On a scale of 10 I give V For Vendetta a 10.",

It's interesting, but the tone and atmosphere of the movie is too cartoony and in Hollywood style, and hence it tends to become the usual superhero story instead of something more as it wants to.

The action is enjoyable, the direction is brilliantly stylised and the social commentary is surprisingly relevant, and really worked for me. Now the film wouldn't really work this well if it wasn't for V, who's just a great character. He's equal parts charismatic and well fleshed-out, and it's honestly believable that someone like him would incite the events within the film. Hugo Weaving is also doing a really good job, and the blend of tones feels really natural and makes the film feel a lot more fresh. Whilst I did like Natalie Portman's character and performance on the whole, her accent is just awful, probably the worst part of the film.

At least for the most part. It is not that the man wanted to be that way, because who knows what he might have become had he not been brutalized by a self-serving government. Don't let that description deter you from seeing this movie. The main character was not much stranger than the way this movie was delivered. This is the type of finished product that will be remembered for a long time. The offbeat introduction to the less important characters was as strange as V, himself. Comic relief is handled better in this movie than any other ""graphic novel"" movie that I have seen. The story is very well done. The imagery was excellent.

A Christian man is being condemned to death in Afghanistan for converting for Christianity, Chrstiantity is not the problem. This movie could have been done a lot better if its ""Anti-Bush"" message was a little more even keeled. I mean to me the left wing is the threat in this country, not the right. Further, the main message of the movie was that we should watch out for ""christian anti-gay and anti-Muslim governments"" pleeeaaassseee. The main threats to peace in this world are indeed islam, china, Russia, Iran, north Korea, and the middle east. Not a guy who loves Jesus. This ultra-political movie was junk. It seems that the right wing is an easy target which makes me realize that thats why its bullcrap when we see them as the political threat. This movie takes the easy route, for budgetary reasons. The fact that movies aren't made that are critical of islam or china or the left tells me that those things are the threats.

Totalitarian State in the near future, one man a possible 'Anti-Hero' (V{Hugo Weaving}) fights for the people along side a fabulous Evey(Natalie Portman). Breathtaking action sequences, awesome usage of bullet-time, two most memorable explosions (amongst the many), and the most peculiar kiss ever portrayed on the big screen. V For Vendetta truly has it all. Without giving away much of the storyline, V is an ex experiment gone well!

But then, i realised it was much more than that. There is such a deep message in it which is delivered with so much beauty and love that it inspired me and changed my spirit. Beneath the Anarchist side of the movie, it is the mirror of our world, where everything seems to be fine, a world ruled by TV and the media in which we consider to be telling the truth about what happens. It represents the control governments have trough fear which they generate to attain power over us. And weak in mind as we are fall into it. V for Vendetta really is an eye openner and makes you see different prespectives of the world we're living nowadays. Natalie Portman is at her best as well as all the other actors.

I know my parents talk about demonstrating in the name of peace in the 70s etc.. but when is the last time there was a MASS global movement on account of anything?

1176,5 April 2006,Hazbear,8, An Amazing journey,"Simply put, V for Vendetta is an amazing and challenging film. One wonders what Tony Blair would think of it - whether it is a glimpse of the future, made possible by Bush's war. The movie is set in the year 2020, where England is completely controlled in a dictatorship based on fear and submission by it's leader Adam Sutler(John Hurt in a Hitler-type role). The general population is kept under control by Sutler's Fingermen, pretty much criminals with a badge. Through the movie's intro, we discover that the rest of the world has succumbed to disease and chaos, and England has disassociated itself from Europe as the only ""free country"" left in the world. America is singled out as a ""diseased leper colony"" that has dissolved into civil war due to an international war they started years earlier (no guesses for which war that was). Into this world, we are introduced to Evey Hammond (played wonderfully by Natalie Portman - forget her performances in the dreadful Star Wars prequels, as here she excels). One night after a government imposed curfew, she is caught and almost raped by the Fingerman. To her rescue comes V, a masked vigilante who rescues her and transports her to safety. Evey is taken to V's secret compound, where we discover V's whereabouts and the reason for his Guy Fawkes mask, as well as his crusade for revolution. To go on would be to ruin the story for the curious, however, I must say that this movie was a breath of fresh air in a world of political (right wing) correctness. The performances in the movie are outstanding, particularly Hugo Weaving, who plays the neo-terrorist V. For a character who appears the entire movie in a mask, Weaving's voice and mannerisms provide all the personality and character you would expect from a fully faced actor. In fact in some of the scenes you forgot there is a mask at all.",

It is a thought-provoking and action packed vision of a totalitarian future Britain, but it could easily be any other country. The story is different and exciting, the action is violent and not watered down like most action flicks of late, and the performances by the excellent cast is great. Hugo Weaving takes the cake, even though he is behind a mask the whole time, with his cool voice and ass-kickery, and Natalie Portman is amazing. She is one of the best actresses in the world today, and she proves it by being tough and beautiful (even after having her head shaved) and hitting all the right emotional notes right on target. The last 30 minutes of the film is one of the most exhilarating scenes i've ever seen in a movie theater. At the movie's climax i was nearly standing.

All in all, this movie showed a realistic view of what has happened before in history, and shows what can happen again.

The idea it brought to my mind was ""when"". This was an extremely believable plot that really did provoke much thought. The dialogue throughout was superb, and the casting was excellent. I'm not a huge fan of films that use American actors to play Brits or vice versa, but I really can't think of a British Actress who could have played Evey. and Hugo Weaving was spot on with all the accents in the film. Northern England by an American cannot be easy!! What I also enjoyed about the film was the way that everything was laid out like a TV serial of a crime. I felt like I was watching a special drama. Not many films can do that. The danger with a film put in the genre of action is that the writers and producers go overboard with the special effects because that's what the public expects. The specials in 'V' were effective because they were used necessarily. What carried the story was the dialogue, but the film was still action.

Most of the decisions they made seems appropriate to me. The acting also is sensational. The film provides wise entertainment and is emotionally powerful thanks to Natalie Portman. Furthermore, the movie somehow relates to the contemporary political situation and, what is the most important, persuades into thinking. In particular, two scenes are amazing. First one is the TV show a la Benny Hill and the second one is the final scene in which a motif of everyman is used. Highly recommended.",

Of course, the movie does leave you thinking about society, people, and a sense of wisdom. Walking out of the theater, it made a huge commentary on our current society and government.

One saves the world or better said, helps the people in it, because they have too much fear to resist the government. He becomes a symbol which is feared by the government, because they don't know who he is. Only Finch and his colleague of the police get onto him and in time you can see how Finchs attitude changes and he begins to think about the things that happen. Hugo Weaving plays the role of V brilliantly. The very intelligent and aggressive avenger with a lot of patience for the good thing. During the movie also appears his vulnerable side full of sentiment which makes him a very pleasant person. I like Natalie Portman as Evey . She develops herself just in a different way than V. She is the vulnerable rather weak person who becomes much stronger by V. While V becomes more vulnerable by the love to Evey, but he keeps sight of his aim.",
1215,19 April 2006,daviddesancho,6, You could have it so much better (with Alan Moore),"'V for Vendetta' is a well intended film for today's audience. As many other science fiction movies, like Matrix or Blade Runner, it presents a could be-world in which freedom is an underrated right, and a character who is willing to put things upside-down. So, as every dystopia attempts, it makes you think. It is interesting in that the film is absolutely not a follow up to Neo's special effect nightmares. In fact there's only one sequence that will satisfy the people of that likes. But regrettably neither the film is well directed nor did the Wachowskis write a screenplay that raises questions in depth. The filming language is extremely poor in some sequences, like those of the burning birth of V at Larkhill, or the ones about the lesbian couple. A somewhat shallow film, though the strength of the comic books remains in the character of V. Besides, it's always pleasure to see Ms. Portman and hear Julie London's 'Cry me a river'.",

Natalie Portman also has a significant role as Evey, V's only helper. Best scene, to me, is the one on the beginning when V is destroying all those buildings while the classical music plays loudly in the background.It really looks as a perfect introduction to the spectacle that follows...After all, you got to give credit to Alan Moore who deserves all the praise for the story.

I knew in advance that is was based on a comic novel, but I did not let that put me off! In my opinion, this would be a good movie for the disinterested in politics younger generation. There seems to be relatively few young people who are concerned about the gradual erosion of our freedom and civil liberties in this country, for example, the introduction of ID cards, the paternalistic government which tries to become involved in every aspect of a person's life and, more worryingly, the gradual erosion of our basic freedoms under the guise of protection for the ordinary citizen. Unfortunately, in this vision of the future, it soon becomes unclear who are the bad guys. Any voices of dissent are brutally disposed of. The government will protect you from all those who are out to get you, but at an exceedingly costly price. The erosion of our freedom.",

Unfortunately if you go surfing the net, this revelation is also likely to pop up when you click on some link or movie preview. His acting has really been unbeatable in this movie. To think that he was also agent Smith is truly amazing. The movie itself is pretty good and highly refined. You may be expecting a lot of action scenes and a few more could have possibly been added. Its not as if they could'nt come up with a few new ideas if they wanted to? The only problem in this movie are that the writers are way too obsessed with current political issues, way too obsessed with muslims and even more obsessed with homosexuality, as ideas fit for oppression by a dictatorship.

1219,18 March 2006,lunybin,3, V for Very Crappy,"The excessive dialogue, and numerous discussions of what happened in the past what will/may happen in the future make this movie move at a snails pace. Even when they do finally cut to flashbacks/forwards, they are slowed down by the voice over. The very first scene should be an indicator that the movie is going to move too slowly, filled with long alliterated dialogue, which is supposed to be comical but just ends up being annoying. The entire movie tries to pound it's message into people's minds, ""People shouldn't fear their governments; governments should fear their people,"" but the message is overdone. It feels force-fed and doesn't have any subtlety to it. In the movie they talk about how writers use lies to tell the truth. Writers also use fiction to bring about philosophy, hiding it like candy coating. This movie was all sophism, one big rant without enough story wrapping it up into a swallowable package. Don't get me wrong, the message is a good one, and I really wish the movie could have delivered it in a blockbuster fashion, but they didn't. And when a message is delivered poorly, sometimes it would have been better if it weren't delivered at all.",
1220,17 March 2006,bjmilhist,9, V for Vendetta (Spoilers),"V for Vendetta is the first fun, clever and entertaining political film that I have seen since The Crying Game and The Battle of Algiers. I thought that Hugo Weaving (V) and Natalie Portman (Eve Hammond) gave excellent performances. V is a man on a mission: revenge for the terrible actions of his government against him and enlightenment for the citizens of his world. He takes action and from his actions come the beginning of the ""revolution"". V understands that he must teach his fellow citizens--he teaches through the destruction of symbols: justice has been abandoned in a theocratic-fascist England, and so he destroys the Old Bailey. He encourages their small steps: symbolic actions (the small child spraying a graffiti V, etc.) and anonymous action (the Guy Fawkes outfits for everyone in London). All the while, he carries out his personal acts of revenge. As for Eve, he teaches her through kindness and ruthlessness--he drives away all her fear. He makes her a rebel. The film highlights two acts of rebellion, quiet, but costly, that cost two people their lives--one, Gordon, gets swept up in the ""V mindset"" and forgets about the Fingerman, and commits a revolutionary act (humor as revolution) -- he also wears a mask, he passes as ""straight"" but is a gay man in the frightening world of the Christian fundamentalism; even more important, his courage reminds Evey of her parents, their sacrifice, and now his sacrifice. And finally, Eve draws comfort and courage from the autobiography of a young lesbian, once again, who keeps her integrity . . . Evey finds her own courage and integrity . . . She is willing to die anonymously, in order to preserve V and the ""revolution"". An altogether lovely film.",

The acting too was something marvelous, Weaving who never shows his face still managed to transmit real feeling trough his voice and movements.

1223,13 April 2006,daniel-johnston,9, a V good film!,"V for Virtuous, V for Vintage, these are but two words that describe V for Vendetta. V for Vendetta is a surprise package as, in my eyes, it is a lesser know DC comics character but it by no means is punching above it's weight by entering the film world. It can be compared to another DC comics favourite Batman, as Batman Begins is very similar to the way this film is laid out and how the story is told, it's dark, it's mysterious, it's awesome! I have never read the V for Vendetta comic, but I want to now. For a start V (the main character) isn't your average muscle bound, chisel jawed hero. He never takes his mask of, he is very well spoke, loves Shakespeare and isn't your goody goody hero as some people might perceive him as the villain depending on your point of view. The best bits of the film have to be whenever there are loads of bad guys trying to gun V down and he just whips out the knives and slashes a cap. I would of give this film a 10 but it has its flaws namely Natalie Portman's quite lame English accent. All in all a damn good film that I could watch time and time again.",
1224,1 August 2006,Nedimovnet,9, Political and dramatic yet very unique,"This movie is what I would refer to as a sneak and peak into the future. Why? Take a look at the world today. Our privileges are being slowly but surely cut off. This means that in a not so distant future we will discover that this movie is telling us the truth. I find this movie entertaining and very interesting because I ask my self the very question that has haunted my mind since the first time I saw it. Is V really a terrorist or a freedom fighter? Is this what the future will bring us? Some people would probably find this movie as a typical hero movie where the good guy is fighting the bad guys. I say that these people fail to se where V for Vendetta kicks in. This movie is not what you see in an everyday motion picture where the hero is just a hero. Even though V is wearing a Fawkes mask he is not just a hero. Let's discuss that for a minute. Why is he wearing a Fawkes mask? The Fawkes mask is a symbolical thread and V chooses to wear this mask to remind the people what he is fighting for. The same things Guy Fawkes fought for. Freedom and a better future. Maybe I'm wrong but it occurs to me that V has simply forgotten who he is. He knows what he is fighting for but he has maybe chosen to forget who he was. As you very well know V had his face burned off in the explosion where he was kept as a prisoner. That's a symbol too because his face tells us who he is. V is certainly not an ordinary man anymore but more like a rebel just like Guy Fawkes. V knows what happened the 5. Of November 1606 and he is fighting for the same things. He doesn't just want to blow up the Parliament but he is trying to remind the people of what they have become and what they have forgotten. Remember, remember the 5. Of November The gunpowder treason and plot I know of no reason why gunpowder treason Should ever be forgot When we hear this little song from V we know what is about to happen. He prevails where others have failed.",

1226,3 August 2006,crazymonkeys_2004,10, An incredible film. Highly recommended!,"This has to be one of the best films i have ever seen and rank it as one of my favourites. Set in an England which is under the control of a totalitarian dictatorship, it tells the story of the mysterious figure V and his struggle for freedom against the government. Hugo Weaving plays V superbly while Natalie Portman plays Evey, who is saved by V from some nasty characters and who eventually decides to join V in his vendetta. I don't think the trailers for this film do it justice, so the only thing i can say to do is to see the film itself. I cannot think of anyone better to play V than Hugo Weaving. He has some incredible lines and is just brilliant all the way through. Stephen Fry also stars in this film, with scene stealing moments. The end sequence for this film is rousing and inspiring and brings the film to a great conclusion. I'll say again if i haven't already said it, go and see this film NOW!",

It was very well put together and put out an amazing message about how media lies to sway peoples idea about what goes on. Also it shows how people can come together to go against a totalitarian authority and defeat them without fear. This movie reminded me a lot of the book ""1984"", the movie ""Wag the Dog"", and the movie ""Loose Change"" about 9/11. It showed how the chancellor tried to cover up what was really happening by feeding lies to the public, which the publice did not buy. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a film that makes you think about our govt and if these kind of things really happen, we just don't know about it... Great movie, one of my favorites.",

Not Cyrano, nor The Fifth Element, not even The Sixth Sense had the precision and grace this plot and its actors achieve. It all moves as lightly and easily as a cloud, looking completely effortless, one moment here, the next gone. Every stitch of it fits the rhythm set out in the beginning, with unflinching logic it leads you to the end. And what would this end be? Now What? ""and the rest, as they say, is history"".

1233,3 August 2006,newbrother,10, An anthem...,"So many films that start as novels fail in their transition to the big screenso, it is always a pleasure to see one that succeeds. ""V for Vendetta"" is even more surprising because it started life not as a typical novel, but as a ""graphic novel,"" an extended comic book of sorts. While that might imply a trite or childish story, the protagonist, V, is no super empowered, comic-book hero, but a real man, with real limitations, and real passionspassions that would make Thomas Paine proud. While the original story had overtones of a socialist response to Thatcher's England, the film version is as libertarian, and as American, in passion, as one could imagine. Given the current dismal politic of America, it is perhaps astonishing, and encouraging, that the film appeared at all. Still, stranger things have happened: At the height of Mussolini's fascism, Ayn Rand's pro-individualist novel, ""We, The Living,"" was produced and distributed in Italy. In the same surprising fashion, ""V for Vendetta"" has managed to appear in America, much to my personal delight.

The writing sucks to be honest because it is so very cheesy at times. Natalie Portman makes me very uncomfortable her acting and role in this film is just awkward. This entire film seems very rushed and overdone. Overdone in the sense that there was so many unnecessary parts that did not add anything to film. Wachowski brothers seemed to be on a quest to convince us of this whole idea when we were right along with them the whole time. I appreciated the idea. I think it's great with the government and control but Natalie Portman with a shaved head and some of the things she did and wore made me cringe in my seat with embarrassment.

1239,25 March 2007,kurtCutajar_mlt,10, One of the best comic book adaptations,"As soon as the first few posters of V appeared at the local multiplexes, everyone knew that it was going to be something special. Then you see it was produced by the producers of League of Extraordinary Gentleman. That film was almost risible and so yet another Alan Moore comic-book adaptation went wrong. The only hope that Moore's work would be finely adapted was in V for Vendetta, which turns out to be everything that the other ones were not. Set in the future, the film shows a country ruled by a fascist government headed by the scheming High Chancellor. The people are so clouded by fear that they do not rebel. That is until the cloaked V shows up to wreck havoc and to bring the government's wrong doings to the light. In his plan to do so, he is aided by the innocent Evey, who after being rescued by V, is introduced to a world she had never seen before. To maximize a good film to the full, there is need of a good cast, and V unfortunately falls short of reasonably good performances. Natalie Portman is as good as ever, and her portrayal of Evey stood out next to the others, which were by far more mediocre. She effortlessly handles that typical British accent, and even though I doubt you will ever be moved by her tears, she was still credible for most of the film. The real problem is V. Hugo Weaving does an adequate job of expressing his with sinister nods and head tilts, but there was still very little emotion and it was therefore very wooden. He handles his action scenes very well, but that is still not enough to make his character not beg for belief. John Hurt's interpretation as the High Chancellor is also one of those few who excel. His scenes overflow with menace and hidden desperation. That said, the film is good on many accounts. The action is limited, but the few scenes are violent and blood is plentiful, which is not so common these days. The slow-mo knife-time sequences are brilliant as are the few big explosions in the film. The film also has an interesting political background, which gave the film a more realistic image. The problem is that the film rarely probes into some questions which arise, and it fails to give some scenes the adequate emotional content. However, a couple of scenes speak for themselves. The scene in which V loads an underground train with loads of explosives reminded me of the terrible underground terrorist attacks in London a year ago. This thought was enough to give me the chills.

""The artist uses lies to reveal the truth, but politicians use lies to conceal the truth.""
In the film, the government uses a mysterious institution as a glorious shell, and the interior is already dirty and horrible; they control the people through declarations and television media (the most important media in 2005). The emergence of V as a ""terrorist"" shattered this hypocritical shell, and the people did not fall into panic because the source of their real fear was suffocating government oppression.
Eve and the police officer accepted this idea and concept while slowly searching for facts. ""Three years later, thought can still change the world."" ""You can't kiss the thought, you can't touch it or hold it, thoughts don't bleed, they don't feel pain, they have no love."" Yes, thought can change the world, it can be inaccessible, but it has no love. However, people have love. During the time when V tested and polished Evey, V passed her a note; it was also the same as when V received the note. The contents of the note give V and Eve the ability to love.
""I'm in love with you. I never thought I could still love someone. This is the best gift you can give me."" This is what V said to Evey. I love you because you love me. This is the whole movie in a depressing gloomy atmosphere, but also gives a warm feeling to the heart.At the end of the movie, under the gorgeous fireworks, many deceased people appeared among the spectators. I understand it as the demise of the old world and the old regime. People who had been persecuted before were reborn as the new world arrived. Perhaps, as an ordinary person, V also stood among them to welcome the new students.",

My purchase of V for Vendetta is one such occasion. What a purchase it proved to be, not because it was thrill a minute stuff, not because it had a totally unexpected twist, but because it made me think. Unfortunately part of what this film portrayed is very true today that is to say we are manipulated by politicians and the media. The untrained eye may miss it but it is happening all the same. I shall get off my soapbox and back to the film. V for Vendetta represents the first time I had seen Natalie Portman outside of Star Wars and I was very impressed and Hugo Weaving has one of those voices I could listen to all day long and that makes what his character says all the more potent. The plot was totally believable and the action realistic. This is not a crash bang wallop film. It is action, a love story and a vision of the future that might actually come to pass.

The severity of my feelings may have something to do with my fondness for the original work in all honesty, but I also genuinely feel as if this film is ultimately insulting to the audience in a way that I found deeply depressing - where once we had a story of personal responsibility, the film takes that responsibility away from the characters (and thus, the audience) and perhaps that has something to do with the medium; The comic engages and encourages the reader to think for themselves, the movie is spoon-fed rebellion for the people of today that just can't be bothered to think for themselves.",

It's certainly a timely, relevant film; bringing up issues like media manipulation, censorship, national surveillance, religious hypocrisy, fear mongering, torture, prejudice, etc. But despite that, it was mostly underwhelming to say the least. The script (written by the Wachowskis) felt like it was a slightly revised first draft; the plot was convoluted and the dialogue was half-assed. Though V for Vendetta does boasts some striking visuals and imagery, the cinematography and lighting was ugly and jarringly bright, respectively. During the first act Natalie Portman's performance as Evey Hammond was mostly hard to watch, but late in the second act she is given some dramatic flare.

1267,27 September 2006,spooly_montana,9, Visceral feast for the senses.,"In 1999 the Wachowski Brothers brought us the first groundbreaking Matrix film, filled with cutting edge special effect techniques and an action film with no boundaries. On the heels of the Matrix Trilogy, the always mysterious creative duo bring us another veritable action extravaganza, V FOR VENDETTA. Behind the mask of the caped lead is actor Hugo Weaving, who played Agent Smith in The Matrix films. Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel published by Vertigo/DC Comics, the film is set in London, in the not too distant future. The formerly great United States is now apparently a leper colony, and Britain is ruled by an oppressive, authoritarian government where freedom is looked at as a liability in the effort to control the people. The stunned, complacent masses are kept in the dark from the truth of daily events by the government controlled media which manipulates them through propaganda and censorship. Along comes the caped freedom fighter 'V' (Weaving) who stirs things up for the ruling Chancellor and his forces with a show of explosives accompanied by a little Tchaikovsky music piped in simultaneously as the soundtrack. He conducts this ""performance"" from a nearby rooftop with Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman he rescued from a group of men in the streets earlier that night after she was out past the enforced curfew time. He politely forces her to view the massive spectacle alongside himself, the perpetrator. 'V' later takes Evey hostage to protect himself from being betrayed and caught. The ultimate objective of this charismatic madman is to blow up the Parliament building, giving the power back to the people and getting vengeance for events which led to his being burned and horribly scarred during some government endorsed experiments that went wrong. 'V' is uncompromising in his quest for revenge, and the government uses that to promote an atmosphere of fear, gaining an effective tool of control. The government is for the people, and if it is not, then upheaval must occur. The idea of freedom is eternal, and must be a guiding light for governments and the people ruled by those governments. Intentionally or not, the film does have some overtones of present social and political happenings, certainly here in the United States. But it is fiction, and fascinating at that. This film is quite ambitious, with some visuals that brought me back to Terry Gilliam's 1985 film Brazil. The Matrix creators have done it again with a stunning visceral feast for the senses. V for Vendetta is a moving, triumphantly electric, powerful political action thriller. Hugo Weaving does a good job behind the cover of his mask, a daunting task surely, and Natalie Portman flexes her acting muscles in the distressed, yet strong, role of the heroine Also starring in the movie are Stephen Rea, playing the detective tracking 'V' down and John Hurt playing the tyrannical Chancellor Adam Sutler.

1294,19 April 2006,pwsull,10, The Best Cautionary Tales Entertain,"The comments and reviews (both amateur and professional) on this film here at IMDb and elsewhere seem to run at polarized ends of the spectrum: you either love it or hate it. In my experience, that usually indicates a great, provocative movie that sinks its hooks into you emotionally, and makes you think. This movie has gotten so far under my skin that I feel the need to add some comments about it in a more personal tone than you will find in my more formal and ""intellectual"" review at Netflix (under the name Philip Sullivan). First let me be clear that 1) I am a major league movie watcher and fan, and surprisingly 2) I find myself more in love with this movie than I have been with any other film in many years. My tastes are eclectic, and not wed to any particular genre, but I tend to get hooked by the tragic, romantic, and epic; and good science fiction has been a favorite since modern special effects have made the visual experience credible. I rarely go to the theater these days, generally preferring the convenience and economy of waiting for netflix to deliver my entertainment to my home theater. But my thirteen year old son asked me to take him to V about a month ago, and now I have been back to see it two more times (including a one hour, 40 mile trip to see it in IMAXno better indication of movie love than that). People who pan this movie seem to fall into two basic categories: Alan Moore comic book lovers who can't stand the way the Wachowski brothers translated it to the screen; and intellectuals who enjoy picking away at the story, themes, and messages. All literature and all films are imperfect, and you can always find things about a creative work to criticize, sneer at, and devalue. Sure there are some plot holes, over-simplified morality, a blatant political message, Wachowski excesses, and a purposely ambiguous and romanticized view of terrorism. You can level similar, negative criticisms at a host of movies that are considered ""Great"". To choose just one, think about Casablanca. Talk about over-simplified morality and a blatant political message in a movie! But it has gone on to be considered one of the greatest movies of all time. So come on guys, it's just a movie! ... Entertainment! No one is advocating terrorism, or revolution, but the movie is trying to provoke broader thinking than the narrow, nationalistic, Christian patriotism gripping us since 9/11. In V, director James McTeigue and the writing/producing Wachowskis are melding 2006 box office movie making with a political and moral cautionary tale. If you like your special effect, ""action"" movies unadulterated by content that makes you think and feel perplexed or uncomfortable, don't go see this movie. If you think narrow morality, right wing conservative politics, and fundamentalist religious beliefs are the direction we should be going in, you won't like this film because it tells a story in which those beliefs take us back to fascist totalitarianism. On a superficial viewing you could say V is just the Wachowskis doing ""Matrix meets 1984 by way of The Count of Monte Cristo"". But I think you'd do better to delve deeper on both an emotional and idea level. Action, drama, mood, mystery, romance, tragedy, political intrigue, special effects that go ""boom"", great and moving acting, and perfectly matched music.this film has all of that. So, if you think you are anything like me, go see it. You'll love it too!",

V was of course my favorite character from the start and Hugo Weaving played the part to perfection, his rich voice and interesting gestures gave V a cinematic breath of life! Everything about V was just as mysterious and intriguing as I imagined it. V looked just as he did in the graphic novel, same black cape, same knives and the same Guy Fawkes mask. In other words, the cinematic clone of a perfect graphic novel character! Excellent stuff! Why people hated this movie is beyond me...most reviews I have seen are good but a large majority are bad...I say they need to read the novel and then see the movie a couple more times.

This movie also showed the use of fear tactics, as we see in our current government, used to further political goals. The only negative I had about the movie was the loose use of the term 'terrorist'. Although the word is loosely used by our current administration, and maybe this is what they were wanting to depict in this movie. and if that were the case, then it was well done. but I have seen too many movies where the word 'terrorist' is misused so I error to think it was so in this movie as well.

People having a revolution in their country when we are faced with terrorism today? I understand the point, really, but this plot is only encouraging people to rebel against their government when we should be focusing on unity, and anti-terrorism and not homicidal maniacs! Did anyone notice that Hugo Weaver's dialect and voice pitch changes when he's got Evey in his so-called lair? His body shape was different too. Perhaps the director was purposely having him disguise his voice so that she would not recognize him, but it was just way too different. Even though his form was a mere shadow image, you can tell another stand-in was playing Hugo's part. I bought this film in hopes that one day it can be shown to children of tomorrow when we've somewhat controlled terrorism in our democracies, yet we are having political problems within our own countries. We people still have the power if we want. The whole thing was too dramatic, and what is the point of blowing up the buildings when it's the leaders who are messing us up as a society?

I chose a 7 only because 10 would be perfection & I wouldn't go so far as to say this movie was perfect. I thought the acting was a 9.5 by the two leads (Portman,Weaving). Just listening to the lines delivered by ""V"" was almost musical it was so beautifully done. Natalie Portman is a delight in anything she is in. She simply raises the bar for the other actresses in her age group. In this film she displays a maturity beyond her years which she has conveyed before (see-""Beautiful Girls""). My only problem with this movie; & it is a minor one, is that it seemed a tad long. Perhaps an editing issue with me. That is what had me wavering between a 7-8. The supporting cast was fine if not outstanding. They were all very adequate in their roles. I really enjoyed the cinematography of this film-just lovely to watch.

It never suggests a human being with emotional ups and downs behind the mask, except for one scene where V cries. A beautiful voice and admirable performance in the ""Matrix"", but a set-back for this movie - not the voice, but the style. I'm a great fan of his, but he should have tried to convey more than hate and determination and show a few defining ""cracks"" in the V character.

1328,15 December 2008,hugomullaney,6, Read the Comic,"V is, in ma opinion, one of the most fascinating characters, not just in comics, but in all of literature. Why? Well as Alan Moore depicted him, V was enigmatic, ambiguous and at times quite chilling; the reader found it impossible to tell whether this was a passionate idealist or a cold-blooded psychopath. V talks (in both film and comic) about freedom and liberty; yet this is also a man who both physically and mentally tortures an innocent girl, murders a defenceless woman and manipulates all around him in order to bring about total social breakdown (admittedly in a fascist police state, though this does result in at least one child's death). Though I liked it, the problem the film has is that in trying to make V more human and sympathetic, it misses the point. V has more in common with the idea of a villain than a straight-forward hero. Scenes where he breaks down in tears when Evey leaves, when his hands are revealed to be burnt and scarred or when he cuts down a bunch of fingermen in slo-mo just don't work for me. And don't get me started on that bloody ""vis a vis' speech. Nice explosions though!",

After several different people said ""see it, you'll like it"" I finally did - and I more than liked it, I LOVED IT!! Admittedly I am a Phantom of the Opera fan and the parallels to that character (of which there are many-the mask, the cape, the roses are just a few) were delightful to me. But the plot was also thought-provoking and I found myself sitting in the dark theater alone as the credits rolled thinking about it, and I was driven to return the next night to see it again, in an IMAX theater (which I highly recommend if it is available in your area). It was bigger, better, even more powerful in the second viewing. This is a keeper, one of those I must own on DVD. Hugo Weaving is mesmerizing as V, he makes the character sympathetic and compelling though his face remains completely masked. He has some very tough passages of dialogue as well, quite impressive! Natalie Portman is incredible as Evey, she is probably the most talented actress of her generation and she gets to demonstrate her skills here, she shines. I was concerned about the level of violence given its R rating but I didn't find the violence particularly graphic. There is one sequence I call the ""blood ballet"" which is done so artistically that it does seem like a dance rather than a series of bloody killings.

For some hardcore action fans it will have been misleading. For example the group of ""under 25"" guys I went with assumed there was no love story, and were disappointed in that fashion.

A vigilante known only as V is trying to stop the government from ripping people's freedoms away by using a danger plan involving terrorist attacks and well timed murders. The movie follows Evey, a young woman who plays the key role to V's plan without even knowing. The movie starts with V, the vigilante, jumping down from the rooftops and saving Evey from a group of England's oppressive law enforcement. Afterwards, he inquires that Every come with him to see something he had set up. She reluctantly follows to see that he has blown up a government building and hacked into all of the speakers around the city which he had made to be shouting classical music as the building exploded into the night sky, fireworks streaking through the air. As the movie goes, gets into trouble as he sends a message to the whole town over a government frequency about how they have been censoring everything and stands for and stifling the whole city to ensure their rule. He also comments that in one year of the explosion he will act again, but even bigger and more destructive. The rest of the film follows Evey as she tries to survive on the run as the year passes. This movie focuses a lot around the idea of rights and how the government can control its people. Throughout the movie we see the government use censorship to control how the people act and feel. During V's first terrorist attack he plays classical music. The government bans this music from being played to do this to try and make people forget the event. Another instance in the movie where censorship came into play was near the end when they banned any clothes that looked like V's clothes to try and deter people from helping him or following in his footsteps.

1344,28 October 2021,kcain-00621,8, Film Review,"This film tells the story of an extremely intelligent man, the man is simply known as V and is fantastically played by Hugo Weaving. Living in a Tyrannical London England in the 1990s-2000's era. The setting I feel could've been changed to almost any 1st world country that may fear overruling governments. London doesn't feel like the perfect place, yet I see nothing integrally wrong with it. With daytime and nighttime scenes, the film looks fine, the main positive for me is I didn't struggle to see the scenes in the dark which can almost ruin any movie experience. With this film I did have a hard time hearing the quieter conversations, which is almost all scenes involving V. In my experience, the acting throughout the film was good, with no complaints, although I want to praise the quality of acting by John Hurt (The Chancellor/main antagonist). Some may say he oversold the power-hunger of his character, but I felt it was perfectly deranged and slightly out of control. V is for Vendetta has two protagonists, which I think affects the storytelling heavily. V is a broken man who has rebuilt himself. Whereas the other main character Evey Hammond is trying to be your average citizen but her past, her parent's pasts specifically, draws more from her. The weight of two protagonists makes for twice the story to be told and much of this film is divided up to tell each's side (excluding scenes shared between the two) which can be confusing and a little difficult follow. I feel as though the producers did an excellent job of keeping the stories separate while still telling them together. From their chance meeting after curfew in an alley to their second where they both seemed to be in the right place at the right time. Like mac and cheese these two tells complement one another and lead to one solid plot, in which I found no holes/flaws. Like the plot the characters seemed to be ""solid"" in the sense that their reasoning appeared logical, and their reactions came off natural to the character. My overall impression of the film is: the film is worth the watch but isn't exactly a masterpiece. I would rate V is for Vendetta eight out of ten points.",

Fear as a form of domination, has been around for years, keep the people scared is a perfect way to be able to govern without any problems. This was said for example by Nicolas Maquiavello in his book ""the Prince"", 5 century's ago, this is not a new idea, and is perfectly depicted in the film. ""V"" is quite a fascinating character, is a brilliant person, a man full of culture, a real intellectual, he indeed is blinded by a belief, but can that be permitted? Can a person be justified of his/her actions as a trigger for a bigger mean or belief? The movie incites us to try and respond this question. When is a revolution possible? When can it be justified? Can terrorists actions be justified if done for a bigger end? All these questions must be responded by each and everyone of us, can we make things that are not for bragging if made for a bigger most altruistic and fair cause? Can we hurt someone (as V did with Evey, to try and arise new beliefs and purposes? Leaving behind those kinds of questions, as an action film is perfect, pure adrenaline, Hugo Weavings voice is captivating, and Natalie Portman (as usual with the exception of Quuen Amidala) delivers a tremendous performance. A brilliant movie that deals with not very easy to handle issues, more and more after 9/11. Just two more things I loved the use of songs like ""Garota de Ipanema"", ""Corcovado"" and ""Street Fighting Man"" and finally for me the character of Prothero could've been called Bill O'Riley same persona, same speech, same intransigent ideas, same stupidity, same person Prothero and O'Riley.",

""V""'s acts of terrorism are almost justified compared to what the movie's government did to him and others. ""V for Vendetta"" showed me that terrorism is an ideal, and one open to interpretation. To quote V himself: ""One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter"". If you go see this movie, and I strongly suggest that you do, I beg you to do so with that epithet in mind, please. It doesn't necessarily point to any specific group and say that they are to blame.

It's a good film, but the references are so obvious, the collision with aspects of near reality so present, that it's hard to be truly enthusiastic. Of course, it can be a warning, a portrait of a dictatorship, a definition of a high need for freedom, a form of parody, using the plot of Gunpower, Brave New World or 1984 for a kind of manifesto. So, it's good as a response to frustrations, conspiracy theories, or people under tyranny. But can it be more?

V for Vendetta is an eye opener to the public, that if we actually all stand up as one, the government will look out for our interests and not the other way around.

I wanted to throw my everyday concerns away and escape to a fantasy world, but this movie offered a view particular to trenchant lefties that wouldn't let me go, counter to my experience as it was. Fry and Portman and Weaving seemed to me to be three experts on a current affair hypothetical - chosen as they agree on their hatred of conservative values. Unlike the views of minority groups on current affairs, however, the intro is essential to the story, and the overall story is escalating and gripping. What is Fry's character's relationship with Evie (Portman's character)? Who is V? Why is V so vengeful? Insight to the characters is brilliantly given through old movie snippets, such as ""The count of Monte Christo."" One still feels that not all loose ends are tied. But then Tolkein didn't do THAT with his LOTR, so it's not really essential when important issues are settled. Portman is a great actress. She explores Evie deeply, and one feels that Evie is a real person, with elements of two dimensional shallowness and great depth. It is easy to play a character of conviction, but playing those who doubt their own reality is very hard. Evie grows and changes and Portman takes us on this journey. Fry too shows us much of himself. I felt he wrote his own role. I'm Australian. Weaving can do no wrong. Conservatives are all right wing fascists. And stupid. And evil. But then this is fantasy .. even if some feel this reinforces their reality.",

As for action sequences - they were mainly confined to a brief sequence near the end. As action sequences go, one can easily find lower budget HK kungfu movies that will deliver significantly more punch (pun intended). The storyline - adapted from a comicbook novel - was ordinary and nowhere near the epiphany-inducing, mind-blowing, jaw-dropping experiences documented by many reviewers.

1373,26 April 2007,Heorot,8," Entertainment, warning and wake-up call","Having just seen this cinematic extravaganza, I am compelled to comment on it. I was especially moved by the crowd that gathered to march on Parliament. People banding together because each and every one person believes that what he or she is doing is right(!) does tend to move any one watching, such as I. What Evy underwent at the hands of V may strike many as going too far. It was however, in the conviction of V, the only way he knew to set her free from her fears. And that strikes right back at a central issue of the film , which is that fear can control you, and hold you silent when you should not be. Justice is not a building, but an idea, that lives in the hearts of men and women. And that has much to do with what V tells us in the beginning of the movie: ""People shouldn't be afraid of their governments; the government should be afraid of the people."" The film is full of ideas; is V the flesh under his mask? should we be allowed to make fun of authority figures? should anyone have to suffer injustice? The movie was very stylish and true to the feeling of its parent, the comic, while at the same time being an enthralling movie. It was not perfect; the birth of V, due to medical experiments to create a virus, is weak to say the least. The total story of ruthless men who used a biological weapon to gain control of an election is not. It may seem unlikely, but so many events do, in the political games we see played from afar, all over the world. An entertainment, a word of warning, and a wake-up call.",
1374,19 March 2006,tricksixxx,7, I wanted to not like it.,"Simply because of all the hype and the proposed pro-terrorist agenda surrounding its big screen debut, but dammit it's a good movie. Maybe not AMAZING as some people have been bold enough to say, but it is an an entertaining and fun script and the action is wired up correctly. I usually don't lean towards movies that push political agendas, especially far left or far right ones, but this movie is about revolution. Yes, parliament is blown up, and yes the big ben clock tower is not spared, but these actions lead to a revolt by the people.....all of them, not just a small party with destruction at hand. Once all the people stand up and revolt against a government to overthrow it, it is considered a revolution and it is how America was founded. So before you judge this movie as a promotion for terrorism, watch it for yourself and make up your own mind. As for the acting, it was about what I expected....not great but certainly exceptional. I know nothing about the comic so I cannot comment on it faithfulness, but I hear it's not a very faithful adaptation so comic lovers beware. The action is up to par, even though sometimes it's a little unbelievable and the enemies of V stand still on occasion and just let him pulverize through them. The dark, gritty setting was nice and about what I expected coming in to see it. The ideas were a little far fetched, and America bashing does take place in it from time to time. The sound was very good though, and should be noted to be a good big screen quality. The directing was about average for these types of movies. The violence is not as strong as some may have predicted. Overall this is a good movie with a damn good screenplay and you should check it out for a good time.",

In the movie, we see how the government seems very controlling, which is the reason why Vendetta is doing what he is doing as he attempts to take down the government. I do not want to spoil the movie, but I will say the director of the movie has done a great job in the way he portrays the comic, and how the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.

V for Vendetta went above our expectations to deliver a story familiar enough to be exciting, but with a uniqueness that kept the show interesting. In fact, I enjoyed the similarity of some elements with Batman Begins and Casshern. I was even more surprised by the fact that with all the formula for Hollywood action films so ubiquitous in recent movies, V for Vendetta actually had something new for me - a strong cast of characters who can act, intellectual dialogue, history and drama, not to mention worthy political theoreticizing. V's main point is not action sequences, which I recall only at the beginning and the end of the film.

Yet, what about those who care for a great story? Well I'd say that V for Vendetta is as creative and superbly imaginative as cinema can get these days. The concept of an alternate totalitarian world, as depicted in the movie, is captivating because of the modern time frame it is attributed to.

It is a statement about corrupt governments and how important freedom is and the importance of an idea. Second of all. Loved the language. So poetic and beautiful. It is almost like watching a Shakespearian masterpiece. The Wachowski Bros. are very good story writers, and yet. It wasn't so deep that I couldn't understand what they were saying. The dialogue flowed so smoothly and smartly and lastly. The acting was outstanding. It was cast so well and every actor fit their part like salt and pepper. Hugo Weavings best performance. In conclusion, this movie was all expected and more. ***** out of *****. Absolutely brilliant and valuable information.",

This movie has all the action but its also moving, thought-provoking, wonderfully acted, and well lets just say absolutely brilliant and get it over with. The famous screen writers obviously had a vision and what you see on the surface portrays that vision well. However, just as with the Matrix and its subtle references to Jesus, if you pay close attention there are many underlying messages that make this movie really special for buffs like me. I am sure somewhere on the Internet there is, or will be, a web site that will point them all out. To mention them in detail would mean including spoilers here and anyway its worth digging for the gold.",

Hugo did a good job NOT sounding like Agent Smith for most of the movie and it helped V to become it's own character so when Hugo did sound like Smith (normally when speaking in philosophical explanations of the ""why"" of it all) I realized it was on purpose. Smith became whoever he wanted to become in the Matrix and he evolved in the Trilogy to be able to take over the persona of people OUTSIDE the Matrix and into Zion. And it is almost as if Agent Smith has now evolved to exist outside of the Matrix Trilogy. Almost like he is now a consciousness that can pop up in any film. It was an eerie feeling.",
1394,22 March 2006,michael.will,8, A tasty appetizer for a grand main course?,"""V for Vendetta"" is a sprawling urban fantasy that solidly entertains, despite puzzling the viewer in annoying ways that one can only hope will eventually prove to be strategic. A mega-budget adaptation, by the Wachowski brothers who gave us the ""Matrix"" franchise, of a series of graphic novels (which I've never read, I cheerfully admit to being a just-devirginized fan), it's more or less a hodgepodge of ""1984"" and any number of Euro-traditional super crook epics, from the early silent days, like ""Fantomas"", laid out in a cunningly abstruse manner. While it seems to be a self-contained narrative, chugging along in a haphazardly linear way to a grandly philosophical conclusion, any certainty that the story actually ends is undermined by lingering doubts over the reality of much of what's occurred. Nothing so hokey as ""it was all a hallucination"", but the viewer senses that maybe both his and the girl protagonist's perception of events has been toyed with, and there's plot elements all along the way to back this up. Couple these with the fates of several key characters, which we're only told about, and there's more than a whiff of a new franchise in the works especially if there's a big about-face over whom the real villain(s) of ongoing piece turns out to be.",

Easily the best movie to come out so far this year,","packed with plenty of style, bunches of action, various interlinked interesting and engaging characters, a contemporary message that cannot be missed and a couple of attractive leads, both of whom bring forth developed personas, as well as an intriguing relationship, all wrapped up in a giant ball of entertainment. That's right, if you didn't think that a movie can both entertain on a visceral level and warn you about the dangers of ""too much government"" at the same time, prepare yourself to be stupefied as VENDETTA does just that, and does it all in style, grace and a wicked pace that doesn't even give you a second to consider the possibility of getting bored(it's just not going to happen). I was engrossed by this film from scene one all the way through its many deviations, surprises, twists and terrorist turns, as it continually kept things moving, while at the same time, allowing us to follow the events as a detective mightfiltering through all of the clues and twists dropped throughout. Who is this V character? Why did they shave Natalie Portman's head? What really happened to her parents? All pertinent questions which are all slowly responded to, as this futuristic English society begins to crack under the pressure. For me, the film made me question stuff, exhilarated me at various moments (the final ""fight sequence"" was poetry in motionoh, and bloody!), allowed me to relax and enjoy some of its quieter times (the scenes between V and Portman in his underground lair were romantic and Portman dressed up as a lolita was good and ultimately engaged me in a circle of curiosity throughout. The ending wasn't as unpredictable as you might expect, but that was fine, since it was the journey that was the enjoyment for me. The film also had style with everything looking very slick, dark and deadly. It also had a tinge of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE undercurrent working below it, which is always nice. Kudos to all of the actors in the show as well, since their commitments to the characters were also part of what made this film come alive, and extra props to Portman for bringing home her A-game and even Hugo Weaving, who might have had the hardest job of allemoting stuff behind a frozen mask. But you know whathe did it! I felt for this guy and that's the sign of a great actor. All in all, don't go into this film expecting a wham-bam-thank-you-Wachowki type of flick, because it's far from that. This movie contains more ideas than action, more politics than thrills and more ideology than bullet-time, but in the endit does deliver in a little bit of everything, and for methat's always welcome in this world of rehashes and remakes . Viva la V for Vendettafinally, some guts on the big screen! Oh, and if you've always wondered what the difference was between a terrorist and a freedom fighterwonder some more.",

I think I might have actually enjoyed the outburst if it had been done tongue in cheek. But the writers actually intended us to take it seriously. It was as absurd as the speech by that character, whatever he was called, in the second Matrix. It would have earned a d minus in a college essay. V, I realized sadly after about 20 minutes, was a boring pretentious movie, an attempt at a political message by people who obviously don't have a very good grasp of the subject on which they want to lecture the world. Instead of the directors who did the excellent first Matrix movie, I got the ones who did the two final lame installments in that series. My bad luck.",

It's not just the amazing action scenes ( especially the explosion of the Houses of Parlement ) or the incredible performances by Natalie Portman as Evie, John Hurt as Chancellor Adam Sutler and Especially Hugo Weaving as V. V is an amazing character and I'd compare him to The Joker played by Heath Ledger from The Dark Knight ( 2008 ) because in every seen The Joker was in it was magnificent. Natalie Portman is an incredible as Evey she really gives it her all and is very believable as a young woman who learns to concur here fears and. becomes almost as important as V. John Hurt as the ruthless dictator Adam Sutler is great and is a very believable villain you really start to feel anger towards the atrocities he has committed and the lives he's destroyed. My full analysis of V For Vendetta is that it is one of the most underrated movies of all time and is a really great experience if you love action movies or political dramas then you will love this mix of both i give V For Vendetta a 10/10",

The England of the film is not terrifying merely for the fear and disgust its rulers evoke, but for how near it is to our own times. There are no flying cars or laser guns or any of the other trappings of dystopian, science-fiction movies with omnipotent rulers. Everything as shown in the movie could be put in place tomorrow, and in some parts of the world, it is already a part of everyday life. Go see this movie for its splendidly filmed, awe-inspiring visuals and to placate the understandable itch to see what all the fuss is about, but mostly see it to question and probe. This movie was meant to be political, and it surely is. Some will lambast it for its apparent ""glorification of terrorism,"" but as an avowed conservative, just what would any freedom loving individual do in the characters' circumstances? Convene a protest? Sign a petition? Agree or disagree with my admittedly humble opinion, see it to strike up a discussion, one that is sadly becoming less and less frequent nowadays.",

Although I usually reject on principle science fiction that is culturally stylized after days gone by and did so at the beginning of this movie, but then I found that it truly seems to work in this picture. It's the revival of the classical take on democracy and freedom through the collected black listed material of V and other secretive rebels that lends such authenticity to the backdrop. Other things this movie had going for it: one, a musical rhythm that saturated the pacing of the plot from beginning to end with metaphors for music with the explosions and then again with actual music; two, very artistically driven characters, a trait which gathers sympathy for the rebels (before you even know how they have been subverted or why we should feel for them) by appealing to the emotional side of the brain; three, a very nuanced, intricate and layered diegesis with false characters and hazy pasts; and four, timing, as in being in the right place in the right time with all the unclear (at the very least) dealings of our governments (both British and American).

All these names are the main reason this movie is a masterpiece. The name,V expresses all the events that are happening in London. Now that is shear brilliance. The action is one of a kind. Not only the punches and kicks are sorted out in style but so is the co-ordination. The direction itself is basically a professional attribute. The characters draws you to the story's main idea and they are unique in ways different from other movie. My favorite character is V because he is flamboyant, literary, a fighter for freedom, and makes the movie so great. The plot and tag line, both complicated and epical but once you see the movie you get the idea. In watching the movie for a good hour in the theater I thought V would have sought for a normal revenge. But not.He plotted his revenge steps ahead the police and the government. I even felt sorry for the bad guys. The director really made V and them connected by sorrow. My advice is that if you love the Matrix then you'll love this. To me this is better than the matrix!",

The Brothers W. managed to tell a complicated tale that could be taken as the back story from today's headlines with relative ease.In large part they manage this feat through the efforts of two fine actors, the diminutive but intense Natalie Portman and the long limbed and velvety voiced Hugo Weaving. Together they counter the action scenes of slo-mo blades slicing through the air with acid trip trails with real drama delivered with few wasted words and much emotion.

I saw it on television and I hated it from the first battle with those security officers. Let me say why. Using Tsjaikovski's 1812 overture is a complete misuse of it. Tsjaikovski wrote the piece to celebrate the victory of the Russian armies against the armies of Napoleon. Napoleon, as we all should know, was a product of the French Revolution. The French Revolution was heavily anti-Christian and heavily anti-monarch while the Russian monarchy was heavily Christian and aristocratic. That is in complete contradiction with the theme of the movie.

1432,13 April 2006,besttom,7," Thought-provoking, Orwellian, but a bit too preachy (maybe?)","V is a great film - it's got a good storyline, an honorable villain out for revenge against those who wronged him (and, in the process, bring down the Totalarian regime ruling England), and the gorgeous Natalie Portman. While it's hard to argue the Wachowski Bros. do a good job portraying the future in the aftermath of the past we're in the process of creating (What?), it just seems to me they go out of their way to tie almost all the ills of the ""Big Brother"" controlled future to the U.S.'s current myopic administration. But as I opened with, they do a good job presenting that scenario. They refer to the wars of the ""Former United States"" in the early part of the 20th century, almost calling those wars the cause for our downfall. But what really did us in was our lack of preparedness for Bird Flu (or pick-a-flu), and the controllers of the state of Britain have gone a great length to remind the citizenry of that everyday - drilling fear into their heads constantly. (Sound familiar?) The movie is black, foreboding (depressing, actually), but it tells a story that compels the viewer to argue we're not headed in that direction (at least, if you don't like Bush it's easy to see that). That being said - and I can't put my finger on it - there was something missing. Yeah, we could've seen ""The Man Behind the Mask,"" as it was very hard to connect w/ V. (Also, the first chance we hear the hero speak, it's nothing, NOTHING, but words beginning with the letter V. OK, we get it, you can write a good scene, CONGRATULATIONS!) But despite the fact we see the root cause of his terrorism, I didn't connect w/ him because I kept wondering what this guy behind the mask looked like. Alright, enough of that - the action was good - it was definitely from the Wachowskis, but it wasn't ""Groundbreaking"" like the Matrix (and I mean that in a good way). The action contributed to the film without making itself the centerpiece of the film. All in all a great flick and - I'm sorry, I have to - any chance, ANY CHANCE AT ALL, to see Natalie Portman is alright with me - she is just plain FINE!

1433,16 March 2006,sillyputty235,10, Absolutely amazing!!!,"When I walked into the theater, I expected this movie to be a good sci fi flick. Good seriously undermines fantastic, which seriously undermines my feelings about this film. I have a firm belief that this is and most likely will be one of the best films of 2006. The acting was brilliant, Hugo Weaving, Natalie Portman and Stephen Rea were all fantastic in their roles, not one of their characters was worn out and their personalities stood firm throughout the film. The special effects were good, though they are not the trademark of the film, unlike the recent Star Wars movies. The main theme of the story is a regularly exercised one. There are many stories like it, such as Fahrenheit 451 and 1984, but Vendetta captured the audience's attention, and could relate the mysterious character V to the audience. Although the character exhibited heroic like traits, he had certain imperfections that showed him to be a man. Overall, this film was fantastic and I hope that it can be given a place on the Top 250 list of all time.",
1434,19 February 2022,tennisboyn,7," No real politics, just ""poli-talk""","V for Vendetta comes off as a slightly adolescent view of the evils of government and the dangers of power manipulation... is it a bad message? Absolutely not. But when 2 hours of murky, over-wrought dialogue can be boiled down to two short sentences, problems arise. Many of V and Evey's lines sound like a politician trying to explain something so as to not explain it at all. The dialogue is indigestible, uncomfortable at times. Naturally, this makes the pacing awkward in many of their scenes... despite moments of acting brilliance from Portman. This culminates with the most cringeworthy and unnecessary scene in the whole movie: Evey's grandiose confession that ""God is in the rain."" Visually, the film succeeds, showing every camera angle in the dictionary. This isn't overbearing at all, and kept me engaged when the dialogue failed to do so. The colors, lighting, and set design also tastefully set the tone of the film. Overall, the acting impresses, with Portman and Fry deserving all around praise. To compare this to another film centered around a character representing chaos (Joker), this is where this film succeeds and that film doesn't. This film provides a more intimate look into the effect of that ""idea"" onto others. In Joker, the girlfriend represents a girlfriend, nothing more. In this film, Evey is more detailed and understood. Their relationship is rocky and nuanced, but we realize that she always agreed with him, she just never had the ""artillery"" to see those dreams materialize. The ending of V for Vendetta (everyone joins together, watches Parliament blow up) is frustratingly dramatic, but it works nonetheless. Overall, a solid, thought-provoking film with a stalwart cast.",
1435,19 March 2006,oneimaginaryboy-1,2, Alan Moore definitely saves face.,"Dear Larry and Andy Wachowski, I want my money back. You sold me V For Vendetta, a story of ideological revolution with a hero who was equal parts William Shakespeare, Alexander Dumas, and Abbie Hoffman. The product you delivered was certainly G For Garbage, and the ""hero"" you offered in the movie was the bastard child of MTV, Osama Bin Laden and Michael Moore. Instead of taking a few liberties with the plot as most movies based on comics do, you felt it necessary to rewrite the entire story. This was certainly NOT the V For Vendetta I remember reading and re-reading. This was, simply put, one of the most dumbed-down pieces of garbage put on film I've seen in recent memory. Alan Moore made a very wise decision by asking for his name not to be put on this travesty.",
