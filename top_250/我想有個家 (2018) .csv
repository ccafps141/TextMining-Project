0,23 July 2020,planktonrules,8, Well made but very difficult to watch....and not a film for everyone.,"""Capernaum"" is a very unpleasant film that deals with very unpleasant situations and people. Because of that, it's not a film for kids to watch and I don't recommend anyone suffering from depression watch the movie....it's very hard to take and is brutal in its realism.",/

Heartbreaking.,"At first, I didn't want to review the movie, just give it the highest rating and leave it at that because I don't think I am worthy to judge it. And here I am, writing this, not because I have become any worthier but because people need to watch it. Capernaum tugs at your heartstrings and makes you ache. It's painful, and not in an ordinary way. I watched the movie a few days back and I still think about it. It's definitely made me more grateful for the things I have. The actors don't feel like they're acting (to some extent they're not), it feels like a reality, their innocent eyes describing a journey most of the world was unaware of.",e

And because of that, which includes a pace and a mood that some may not like that much, it may or may not be your cup of tea. The family problems and issues are so direct and so obnoxious at times, that you may feel annoyed. This is by design. Depending on your level of empathy, you will of course have different reactions to a crying baby for example.",v

There have been images of people trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea, or pouring into Lebanon and Jordan, or other things like that. The reality on the ground for them is horrible beyond belief. This topic gets addressed in Nadine Labaki's ""Capharnaüm"" (also rendered Kafarnaum, called ""Capernaum"" in English). It concerns Zain, a Lebanese boy who befriends Yonas, an Ethiopian immigrant boy.",e
6,4 September 2019,classicsoncall,8," ""We're insects, my friend. Don't you get it?""","This is one of the more disturbing movies one is likely to see. Disturbing in the sense that it reveals the horrendous conditions that people are forced to live in if they have no other recourse. The story follows a twelve year old Lebanese boy, (who quite literally doesn't even know his true age) who has seen enough in his short lifetime that he has no trouble at all distinguishing good from bad. Unfortunately for Zain (Zain Al Rafeea), things are almost always bad, as the story traces his tragic circumstances at home and the way he's forced to use his street smarts to survive in unrelenting chaotic conditions. What infuriated me the most was the extent of human trafficking that the film reveals, which affected Zain's own family and circumstances, to a degree that he lost his own eleven year old sister to a merchant who traded meager security for a youngster he could abuse sexually. I would have been more comfortable with the central character if his upbringing hadn't contaminated him with the obscene language he used in virtually every circumstance, calling his own mother a whore, though her treatment of Zain certainly didn't qualify Saoud (Kawsar Al Haddad) as Mother of the Year. What the story never got around to however, was a resolution to the premise that Zain sued his parents for 'being born'. A courtroom hearing delivered no reprisals against the couple, nor do we learn what happened to the man Assaad (Nour El Husseini), who made Zain's sister an unintended victim. The pathos and poignancy of the story is best expressed in Zain's own words to a mother who held no value for the life her children - ""Your words are stabbing me in the heart"".",w

And the story ..... flowing like a strong current that carries you helplessly you can't do nothing but let go of everything. And Zain, how his energy infiltrated my being, I realized that I smiled when he also finally smiled at the end, that through the movie I became him. He is magic!",r
9,24 September 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, As close to 'real' as possible.,"'Capernaum (2019)' is social-realism at its finest, so palpably 'real' that it almost seems a documentary. It somehow depicts a bleak and difficult-to-stomach world with sparks of hope and fun. Of course, a lot of what happens is devastating, too. Apparently, writer-director Labaki amalgamated the story only from real-life events she witnessed first-hand during her research. It certainly shows and, for me, this information makes everything that much more heart-breaking. It's precisely because it's so real that it hurts so much. This emotional connection is only possible because of a fantastically subdued screenplay, some brilliant direction and typically phenomenal performances from all members of the cast. Indeed, the child actors are remarkably good here, ranging in age from pre-teen to barely out-of-the-womb. It's impressive stuff that solidifies the film as one of the most believable in recent years. The whole thing is just effortlessly engaging, wrapping you up in a relatively small story that usually wouldn't get the time of day it deserves. It may be fiction, but it highlights a plethora of issues that truly plague our world every single day. It's all so domestic and, even, mundane, too. It's just a slice of life that we usually don't see. It's great. 8/10",w

14,22 September 2018,georges-nahas,9, Nadine Labaki's Chef d'Oeuvre!,"Capharnaum is the new precious gift to Lebanese cinema. Directed by Nadine Labaki and written by Labaki, Joelle Keserwani, Jihad Hojeily and Georges Khabbaz the movie follows the journey and the misery of a boy called Zain that led him to sue his parents for giving him life! 
The movie took years to finish with a total of 500 hours of rushes filmed! Shot in a ""Cinema Realité"" style without any professional actors and with a raw cinematography you're going to witness the dark side of the country, the unacceptable neighborhoods, the unfair life that poor children are facing. 
Everyone is absolutely well casted! Zain was the ultimate discovery a super talented boy, the Ethiopian maid was great also and even the real retired judge did a good job. Each actor is really telling his own personal story so you will arrive at a point where you couldn't differentiate if you're watching cinema, a written script or even a documentary. Wonderful job from Labaki and well deserved Jury Prize at Cannes! 
Thumbs up also to Khaled Mouzanar for giving us another remarkable score. The movie is nothing less than heartbreaking. 
As Truffaut freezed his last scene back in 1959 in ""The 400 Blows"" giving us some hope, the last shot of Capernaum will speak a lot...!",9

18,15 April 2019,jmholmes-73727,10," IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERPRAISE, LAST YEAR'S BEST (IN ANY LANGUAGE!)","Two minutes into this movie you start worrying about this little boy, and two hours later you realize it hasn't let up one bit in intensity. The camera explores a city most of us are thankful we do not have to deal with - and by forcing us to do exactly that: deal with it - if only cinematically, it opens us up to great sympathy and understanding of so many people living on the brink of total hopelessness. It must be something like the effect Rosellini's Italian neo-realism films had on European audiences after WW2, this feeling that we are seeing something filmed on the actual streets and in the actual homes of citizens under the great stress of living in a world of deprivation, where everything is broken, and deliverance is nowhere in sight. Much has been written about most of the cast being drawn from the city's streets, and if this is true of the young man who has the lead role of Zain, then we see here the debut of a naturally gifted actor who seems, as they say,
destined for stardom. The movie's overt plea for people not to have children until they can provide them with the simplest necessities is perhaps a controversial issue, but it's easy to see the logic behind it.
There are many indelible moments in this powerhouse of a movie, the most riveting sequence
being the few days Zain spends taking care of a child who is barely 2 yrs. old and needs care much more than the 12 yr. old Zain himself does. How he can dredge up such compassion and care for the baby is a marvel to behold. The camera picks up his generous, selfless nature, reminding us it is his goodness that ends up carrying us to the end, where we finally see a long-awaited hopeful smile brighten his face.
Hunt this one down, search high and low, a stunning achievement in world cinema.",?

It's even rarer when that kid is a first time actor, and the film gets nominated for an Oscar (Best Foreign Language film).

29,2 March 2020,jboothmillard,7, Capernaum,"I first heard about this Lebanese film when film critic Mark Kermode gave his review for it on BBC News The Film Review, and then I found it listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was most interested in it. Basically, twelve-year-old Zain El Hajj (Zain Al Rafeea) is serving a five-year sentence in Roumieh Prison for murder, after stabbing someone and showing no remorse. Neither Zain nor his parents know his exact date of birth as they never received an official birth certificate. In court, Zain declares he wants to sue his mother Souad (Kawsar Al Haddad) and his father Selim (Fadi Kamel Yousef). When asked by the judge why he wants to sue his parents, Zain answers ""Because I was born"". Meanwhile, Lebanese authorities process a group of migrant workers, including a young Ethiopian woman named Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw). The story then flashes back several months to before Zain was arrested. He is a gutsy, streetwise child living with his parents and at least seven other siblings who make money in various schemes instead of going to school. Zain forges prescription drugs for his mother to sell drug-soaked clothing to drug addicts. Zain also works as a delivery boy for Assad (Nour El Husseini), the family's landlord, and the owner of a local market stall. One morning, Zain helps his eleven-year-old sister Sahar (Cedra Izzam) to hide the evidence of her first period, fearing she will be married if her parents discover that she can now become pregnant. Zain makes plans to escape with Sahar and begin a new life. He finally runs away, angered when his parents do indeed marry off Sahar to Assad, and catches a bus with an elderly man dressed in a knock-off superhero costumes, he calls him Cockroachman (Joseph Jimbazian). At the Luna Park in Ras Beirut, Zain meets Rahil, an Ethiopian migrant worker who is working as a cleaner at a theme park. She takes pity on Zain and agrees to let him live with her in exchange for Zain babysitting her undocumented infant son Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole) when she is at work. Rahil's forged migrant documents are due to expire, and she doesn't have enough money to pay her forger Aspro (Alaa Chouchnieh) for new documents. Rahil refuses Aspro's offer to adopt Yonas to him in exchange for the documents to be forged for free. Rahil's documents expire and she is arrested by Lebanese authorities. Zain panics when she does not return, and after several days he begins looking after Yonas, claiming he is his brother, and sells drugs again to make money. One day, while at Souk Al Ahad, Zain meets young girl Syrian refugee Maysoun (Farah Hasno) and claims that Aspro has agreed to send her to Sweden. Zain demands that Aspro send him to Sweden as well, Aspro agrees to do so if Zain gives him Yonas. Zain reluctantly agrees, and Aspro tells him that he will need some form of identification. Zain returns to his parents and demands they give him his identification, but they tell him he doesn't have any. Having disowned him for leaving, they kick him out of their house. Before leaving his parents reveal to him that Sahar died due to pregnancy complications. Zain is furious, steals a knife and stabs Assad. He is arrested and sentenced to five years in prison. While in prison, Zain learns that his mother is pregnant and plans to name the child Sahar. Disgusted by his mother's lack of remorse for her daughter's death, he contacts the media and says that he is tired of parents neglecting their children and plans to sue his parents for having children when they cannot care for them. Zain also claims that Aspro is adopting children illegally and mistreating them. Aspro's house is raided and the children and parents are reunited, including Yonas and Rahil. Zain's photo is taken for his ID card. Also starring Elias Khoury as The Judge. Rafeea gives a compelling performance as the pre-adolescent boy living in poverty doing whatever it takes to solve his money problems, the court case is not something you can seriously, but the leading actor, authentic locations, hand-held cinematography and apparently improvised material make it all worthwhile, an interesting drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language.

Yes, lots of poverty associated issues crammed into a single young boy, but most viewers realize that this film is a compilation to show the rest of the world views of the different issues facing the slums of the world. Yes, ending was hokey, but not important relative to seeing & being reminded of what poverty can do.
The film looks at the slums (even get drone views to show the vastness) of Lebanon w/added Syrian refugees (but could be anywhere in the world) through the eyes of 12 year old Zain.
Problem 1: Over-populaton is driving most of the problems of poverty & slums, but every group (family, religious, ethnic, nationalistic wants to maintain or increase their numbers relative to others) internalized in the father as he says, ""Without children you're not a man!"" Zain to TV reporter, ""I want grownups to hear what I have to say. I'm sick of those who can't take care of their kids, ... all the insults, all the beatings, all the kickings. The chain, the hose, the belt!"" Zain to judge on his parents, ""I want them to stop having children!""
Problem 2: Family w/little income; six children; dependent on handouts, children selling homemade juices on the street, children stealing, parents involved in illicit activities, no schooling, selling off of under aged daughter.
Problem 3: Parents under stress psychologically & physically punish the children. Father to son, ""Get the hell out of here before I kill you!""

It's unfortunately convincing, though there are a few sparks of humanity on display to (very slightly) leaven the horror.

'Capernaum' pushes me to feel another level of emotion because it rather feels like a documentary than a fiction. The realism of this movie brings attention to the reality. I feel as if while I watch the movie, one kid in Lebanon is actually suffering from poverty, abuse, and inner turmoil a child should never experience. The most daunting fact is movie is not an exaggeration.",

The movie is also funny at some points, which created a wonderful effect. The actors, who were actually making us live their daily lives of hardship, did a magnificent job, from Zein to Rahil and even little Yonas. And excellent job from Khaled the composer for the wonderful music thoughout the movie.

63,9 May 2019,tomfeller,8, A young boy navigates the streets of Beirut,"The title of this movie is a Biblical reference to a city along the Sea of Galilee mentioned by St. Matthew, and its name became synonymous with chaos, anarchy, and disorder. The framing story of this movie is a court trial in which a 12 year old boy named Zain (Zain el Rafeea, actually a Syrian refugee) sues his parents (Kawthar al Haddad and Fadi Kamel Youssef) for giving birth to him. It is set and was actually filmed in contemporary Beirut, which is crowded, dirty, and full of slums. Zain is never seen going to school and is small for his age because of poor nutrition, but he is very ""street smart"". Some critics have compared him to Huckleberry Finn. He spends his time hustling on the streets to help support his family, which includes several siblings, and their activities include drug smuggling. After his parents sell his pretty 11 year old sister Sahar (Cedra Izam) as a bride for a few chickens to a local grocer (Nour el Husseini), Zain runs away from home. He moves in with an Ethiopian refugee mother Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw) and her infant daughter Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole), where he babysits the girl while the mother is working. The mother is an undocumented immigrant, so when she is arrested by the authorities, Zain is stuck providing for her daughter. While their lives are brutal, there is just enough humor in the film to make it watchable. The child actors, all non-professionals, are excellent, and the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.",

The photography plays very well with the environment and light, it helps to position the viewer in a chaotic and suffocating scenario.

Her work here runs for pretty much exactly 2 hours and we get to witness the struggles of a young boy in particular with his family, but also with strangers and the impact they have on his life. Really baity material and yep I am not surprised this film already garnered some major awards attention, most of all at the Cannes Film Festival, but also got in at the Golden Globes for example and seems very likely to make it into the last 5 Foreign Language Films from the extended list of 9 at this point. We will see. I think it is a decent film overall. And even if I don't think it is that great or best-of-the-year material, it would not be an undeserving Oscar nominee (if we forget for once the Italian entry got critically snubbed, that one would have been a great winner). Also thumbs-up for the child actor here, who is in virtually every scene from start to finish and does a really good job for his age. This film was also so well-received for the image of society it gives us, regardless if it is about parents sending their 11-year-old daughters into wedlock, salesmen trading very small children, innocent people being imprisoned or a lot more gruesome acts you get to hear about during these 120 minutes. So it is a pretty touching film. I also think the ending definitely makes it memorable. On the downside, it also lets audiences forget about some mediocrities during the previous 2 hours because it is that good. It is somewhat happy, but not entirely, but yeah finding the Black boy again is a bit of an emotional highlight fur sure, even if before that I was not too fond of the really really long story involving him and his mother. I thought the film had better flow before and after that when it is about the boy's relationship with his own parents and siblings. There is of course the heartbreaking story about his sister and there's no way that one won't touch you. How close he gets to taking the bus and gets away with her before his parents prevail. He even proves a worthy opponent (if you want to call him that) to his mother and that way he could have saved the girl's life. Or of course the really devastating comment from his mother about her new pregnancy and how she thinks this one could reduce the protagonist's pain. There is some real absurdity when she even says she will name the girl the same like her deceased daughter, which somehow shows that she is completely replacable and that the woman is probably not really capable of true motherly love, even if on one occasion she minimally protects the boy when the father has another violent outburst.",

A film that sends the same messages about parenting, kids and poverty on a more subtle, believable way. Unfortunately, now we can only witness this long set of scenes that have the occasional sparkle (especially in the second part) but feel utterly disconnected.

It made me think that a person is defined by how they spend their childhood, and how they are treated is what makes them when they are adult and still we judge people so easily that we forget the hardships or struggles that person may have gone through. Despite of all the struggles that Zain went through he still loved his sister and the baby to which he wasn't connected in any way except humanity, It was difficult for him to part ways from his sister as well as that baby and the crime that he committed was also out of love for his sister.

The story has hopeful aspects, at it's conclusion, but the journey to that point is relentlessly dire and hopeless. All the characters are on the bottom rung of society with precious little hope for the future. It is hard to see adults in such a desperate situation but much harder to see innocent children, cast adrift with no support from any adult or from the state.

111,16 December 2019,andrewroy-04316,8, A powerful and devastating picture of a Lebanese child attempting to navigate life with inconsistent parents,"As someone who knows quite little about Lebanon and doesn't naturally seek out emotional character journeys, Capernaum really impressed and struck me. The movie shows scenes from a courtroom early on, where we learn Zain stabbed someone and is suing his parents for neglect. Then we go back through his life to understand what happened. I found it a very effective choice to show the outcome early, as it imposes an air of inevitability and futility that seeps into even the hopeful moments of Zain's narrative, which I think deepens the empathy we feel for his situation. The second act is pretty slow, watching Zain's day-to-day life caring for Yonas, but it is important in Zain's struggle, and the first and third acts make up for it in intensity. The family dynamic and relationship between Sahar and Zain was beautiful early on, and seeing how events came together to make him lash out first at Assaad physically and then at his parents legally was a powerful payoff. Labaki is telling Zain's story here and doesn't provide much insight into why the parents make the choices they do, but she is still successful in making us think about the overt moral questions she asks: was it immoral for the parents to have a bunch of kids without really being able to support them? What are the expectations of parents and families, and what systems should be in place if they fail? How does one break out of this cycle of abuse and poverty? I empathized deeply with Zain in this film, as any audience would. Capernaum is extremely effective as a slice of life character movie and in showing culture and life in Lebanon, and Zain's story and beliefs will stay with me.",

It is very well directed and, as many have said before, the kid in this movie is just amazing. But, having said all that, I found the movie to lack a bit of focus, especially in the first half, having too much to say without the time to do it. I think it needed to decide if it wanted to tell the tale of a boy and his very poor family or how a runaway kid can survive in a very rough environment or how can an illegal immigrant get through life in Lebanon or the proceedings of a courtroom drama about an existential issue. Having so much ground to cover it takes a while to get to, what is for me the most interesting and memorable part of this tale, when the kid has to survive on his own. That segment of the movie is absolutely flawless, and I dare anyone to be left cold watching it.

Everything just seemed so black and white in this film: the parents were horrible people and the kids were angels. That's not the way life is! There are some grey areas. I'm sure the parents had some redeeming qualities and the kids had some flaws but I was hard pressed to find them. I just felt I was being manipulated by the filmmaker into believing how horrible parents are in Lebanon because this is the sensationalist news right now! Save your money and go see SHOPLIFTERS instead if you want to see a balanced portrait of a real family.,
116,24 April 2019,maurice_yacowar,10, Syrian refugee street boy in Lebanon sues parents for giving him life,"This my be the best political film I've ever seen. It's Bunuel's classic Los Olvidados (1950) on steroids. Of course, it's not about politics. But its every fiber arouses fury at the political systems that enable such hell on earth.
In Lebanon a 12-year-old Syrian refugee boy Zain is serving a five-year jail sentence for stabbing the adult man who married and fatally impregnated the boy's 11-year-old sister. Their parents forced her into marriage.
Now Zain is suing his parents for bringing him into a life in which they could not provide for or protect him. He's prompted by his mother's proud announcement that she's pregnant again, adding to her innumerable horde of children, all unregistered, unfed, uneducated, the disdained doomed.
The trial scenes are intercut with the events that led up to it. His father expels Zain for interfering with his sister being sold into marriage. The boy finds refuge with an illegal Somali refugee Rahil. He tends to her infant son Yonas while she works. When Rahil is arrested for her lapsed ID Zain struggles to care for Yonas. He's ultimately forced to let a Lebanese trafficker sell the baby.
For 126 minutes the film displays a gripping sweep of suffering. There is not a moment of drag or boredom. The cityscape looks like a giant warehouse crammed with storage boxes. There is little evidence of any living creatures enjoying any life. The humans we meet are locked into either selfish or desperate improvisations of escape and exploitation. All the actors are unprofessionals living out variations on real experience. If the merciful happy ending seems a bit miraculous, thus witnessing these people' suffering has earned us that relief.
The film is full of images and situations we haven't seen before. In one, Zain draws on his unsteady experience and observation to teach his sister how to deal with her first period. He wants her to conceal so her parents won't sell her into marriage.
When he's forced to steal a bottle of milk from a sleeping baby, Ionas tastes and refuses it, then drops off - it's been drugged. Even the less suffering have their afflictions and desperation.
When Rahil is under arrest, she begs her absent baby's forgiveness when she milks herself in her jail cell, to relieve the pressure. This entire drama is the milk of human unkindness.
In court Zain's parents are allowed their moments of sympathy. Unregistered, unacknowledged, helpless and hopeless, they resign themselves to perpetuating their cycle of suffering. Neither knows the simplest self-respect at even the thin end of the spectrum of white privilege. ""We're ants,"" says the father, so why let Zain go to school when he could be working for the man who will wed and waste the girl.
Of course this Lebanon story speaks to the suffering and torment throughout the world's third world countries, the disenfranchised and the despairing, to which Donald Trump's attack on refugees and asylum seekers has also plunged America.
The film's title means Chaos. But make no mistake: this film is not about the apparent chaos. It's about the World Order so uncaring for the world's suffering as to nourish that chaos.
Two recent news items shadowed my consideration of this film.
(i) Hundreds of millions of dollars have been offered to help the penurious Catholic Church restore its infernal Notre Dame cathedral. Right. Build the edifice and ignore the suffering. That's what Jesus would say. Let a symbol override humanity,
(ii)Disney CEO Bob Iger's salary was $65.6 million in 2018. And that paled beside Discovery CEO David Zaslaw's one-year salary of $129.4 million. Those are one year salaries.
This is the World Order. This callousness sustains the chaos this film exposes so heart-rendingly",

127,26 February 2019,emailtombuchanan,10, An Amazing Two Hours,"I saw ""Capernaum"" at a small theater in Manchester, Vermont and was captivated by the film making, and by the story. Capernaum is a Lebanese film (English subtitles) about a ~12 year old boy barely getting by in the slums, who runs away from his large disjointed family, and finds marginal shelter with an undocumented Ethiopian woman and her infant. The boy is later jailed for attacking an older man who forcibly wed the boys sister. The Ethiopian woman is likewise jailed pending deportation, while her infant son is sold off into a baby trafficking ring. It's a sad story about life and hope in extraordinary poverty, and it's told with brilliantly raw cinematography and invisible acting by a solid cast of non-actors. Capernaum is a mostly bleak film that takes a small positive turn at the end, which left the entire audience in stunned silence, and several theatergoers crying in the lobby. It's also an important film about global culture, human trafficking, poverty, and hope. Capernaum is an important film every First-World American should experience.",

There have been several noteworthy films of kids surviving in slums - ""Pixote"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"", ""City of God"", ""Children Underground"", and many others, and ""Capernaum"" fits strongly in that line pf must see films. No doubt, the slums of Beirut are a crap you wouldn't want your worst enemy to live in, let alone have a homeless kid call the streets his home, but this film bears testimony to the fact that MILLIONS of us are down trodden and the Promised Land is so far out of reach it may as well be on Saturn.",

143,1 January 2021,randreww,10, This is not just another film. You are free to stay chained up.,"This film is no laughing matter. In fact, I think it is historic & fundamental on levels which the western world are incompetently oblivious to. The Cinematography, editing, & stark performances are so natural & seamless, that it feels more real than a documentary. I spent most of the film in tears & shame; utterly oblivious & distraught as to the conditions which probably a very large portion of the population are expected to survive in. Where families are so demoralized they would sell their own children to wealthy paedophiles - who think that 11 year old girls are fit to bare children themselves. Where parents despise their young for costing them what little they have until such age of cultural or social-economic arrangement. The suffering, desperation, & decay is all so many have to thrive in. There are moments where people accomplish commendable acts of kindness & are punished for it as a result of such a cut throat environment. It demonstrates the dictatorship & oppression of a monetary system so obsolete, that it is no longer fit for purpose. Our ancestors lived healthier by comparison, when nature could provide, & not a single child on the planet was locked up by laws created by lesser men. When papers & Passports weren't worth more than life itself. I feel that this film is mostly educational, but is of modern credibility & relevancy where slavery, our devolution, & cultural retrograde are concerned. I am not surprised that this film won no ""British"" or ""American"" film awards; falling upon deaf ears, denial & depreciation of even subtitles, let alone other cultures. But the rest world comprehended it with ease & aptitude. This film is a masterpiece, & puts Hollywood to shame for the billions they blow on frivolous over glamourized trite commercials for all their depth. And it solidifies the heart rending struggles in the eastern world in paying the price for our excessive lifestyles of mono-mania & gluttony. The most universal film I have seen for what can only be described as an eternity. My only regret is that every human on the planet hasn't watched it.",

Nevertheless, he takes charge of what he can and tries valliantly to save his closest sister from the kind of future their own mother has lived. He fails and falls into another hell-hole of grinding poverty and alienation only to be given caring responsibilities for the undocumented child of an undocumented immigrant from Ethiopia. The boy has one outstanding trait, compassion for the lost child. He suffers hideous deprivations to keep this child alive and relatively safe. He doesn't know about the cataclysmic events that are playing out around him. All is pain. It is a marvel that anyone in this story can bear to go on. They do and the chaos just keeps going.

155,9 February 2021,savethecloudsfoundation,6, Great Movie but...,So I liked this movie a lot but I don't exactly agree with some of the ideas in it. The movie is about a boy trying to sue his parents for being born. That is right off the bat an absurd idea. To start with his parents are dirt poor so good luck with that. His claim is that life is so bad he'd rather never been born. He believes his life is worthless. This however is not true because we see him greatly improving the lives of others throughout the film. I don't like this idea that so many people seem to share these days that life is meaningless and unimportant. Life especially human life is very important. Each and every one of us has a place and a purpose whether you realize it or not. I am so grateful for the people I have in my life. No life should be taken for granted.,

The main difference is that those films - inspired and well documented as they are - are still works of fiction, and most of the performers are professional actors. In 'Capernaum' filming is done right in the slums of Beirut, and the actors are mostly real people who come directly from that environment, some of them illegal immigrants, and what they play on screen are their own lives or something very similar. The story of the making of the movie 'Capernaum' could be as interesting as the story in the film itself.

However Labaki stressed through the final scenes that the fault of all this misery lies on the hands of the parents having too many children. That is a really naive argument reducing failed governments, corruption, inequality and a flawed world order into a problem of parents having too many children.
I am not sure if she actually meant that or not but showing the mother to be pregnant again stresses that point which is shame.
It can't be denied that poor parents having many children is a problem but it is a minuscule issue when looking at the more complex reasons for poverty.
It's a shame that she wasted such a compassionate effort on such a shallow conclusion.",

It follows the life of a runaway 12-year-old boy as he tries to survive, take care of a baby, get revenge for his sister and escape out of Lebanon, all at once. There are other films about poverty and the underclass, but this one ""hits different"" as it focuses on a single outcast child with absolutely no support. We feel every challenge and obstacle as he tries to survive on a day-to-day basis with the little Ethiopian baby he is stuck with. The entire world around him is hostile - his parents are abusive, the people smuggler is a con artist, the convenience store owner marries a child, the authorities try to lock up anyone undocumented and so on.

But no matter how artistic it is, it cannot be denied that life is nothing if not harrowing for those poor kids depicted who actually exist in real life.

193,15 October 2018,muguetdemai,1, Emotional blackmail,"The only thing right about this movie is its title. Otherwise, the scenario is weak (if existent), the technique is so-so and the story is just a compilation of all the stereotypes we could have about underprivileged people. It seems that the director and her co-screenwriters didn't even bother to live for few days with an underprivileged family to explore their reality. They just resorted to the easy way: compiling stereotypes and prejudices. And holding people accountable for their own poverty without any mention to the political and social system's failure. And I am really disappointed because I really liked Nadine's previous movies.
Regarding the actors (if we can call them actors), people thought they were fabulous. For me (and I am not belittling what they did, don't get me wrong), they were living their daily life in front of the camera. The greatness of an actor is measured by the way he could embody someone he is not.... And obviously that's not the case here.
The spectator is left lost in front of all the babel-like movie. If we don't like it, we think we're incapable of empathy. But we need to go beyond this self-guilt as spectators. Let's just evaluate it as a movie. That's how we will be able to escape the emotional blackmail it was built on.

Poverty is devastating, whichever shade it belongs, Capharnaüm takes us on a journey towards the worst shade of poverty that one gets to see. The story is seen through the eyes of a 12 year old boy, Zain living with his huge family in an impoverished neighbourhood in the suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon. Zain gives the audiences the world over, a sneak peek of a few days of his life in about a couple of hours. There is a parallel story of an illegal Ethiopian immigrant, Rahil and her cute little son Yonas, which merges with the story of Zain. Capharnaüm is a gentle reminder to ourselves to understand how much of a privileged life we are living.

227,13 June 2021,sudhakaranakhilan,8, Just 'logline' is enough,"The logline of the movie itself reveals the idea of Capernaum, in which it states about a pre-teen boy named Zian sues his parents for the 'crime' that they have done, ie, giving birth to him. It is the catchy element in the movie and the rest of the visuals draw us into the clear picture of what Zain talked about. Zian is surrounded by a lot of siblings and his father and mother are planning for another baby. His life condition (which means his family's life condition) is worse in the sense they don't even care about their children. Zain doing a job in a provision store near his dilapidated house and he earns for his family. Ho doesn't even get an education not even his siblings too. That pathetic condition is clear in each and every corner of the movie. When his sister (she achieved puberty now) put up in the swirl of marriage Zian fought against his father and mother and then he eloped from his family. From there on, the cinema attains an emotional dimension deeply. When Zain babysits Rihal's (an Ethiopean lady who is doing multi-tasking jobs) toddler, Yohan he feels some kind of security and protection from there. Even though Rihal is living more pathetically than Zian lived, Zian adjusts to the situation and he gets love to care for the first time in his life. He looks after Yohan as his brother. On an occasion when he questions himself about the color of Yohan and him (because Zian is white), he states that while Yohan was pregnant his mother drank a lot more coffee. Likewise, that kind of innocence can be seen in the attitude of Zian, but actually, he doesn't know how to show it. You can see Zian smiling only at the end of the movie. In that way, Capernaum flows exactly as chaos and that's why Zian filed a case against his parents to bring him into this chaotic world. Capernaum shed our tears, it'll stay back in our minds and disturb us, and also it will glow upon our souls and resounds how lucky we are.",

When his 11 yr old sister that he is protective of is removed the the picture Zains rage grows & is too hard to bare & he leaves home in a place where humanity hangs by a thread everyday. Whilst searching for her, he finds other people , other situations . It is amazing that a modern day Syria/ Lebanon and other like minded area countries exist with such immoral ideas in their everyday lives. The future of these 3rd world genocidic countries rest squarely on the shoulders of such hopeful future leaders made from the same clay that Zain is made.
Live Simply so that Others can Simply Live. A decent. To survive on those streets is truly an absolutely stunning feat for a 12 yr old ""man"" A satisfying watch with an ending that could have been better and at least lied to the viewers for more of a satisfying closure.",
246,21 September 2018,bluebonn,1, deeply disturbing filmmaking.,"I saw this film at TIFF with high expectations but was shocked but was shocked by how removed the filmmaker was from this issue. Scene after scene of melodrama, clearly crafted by a person of privilege as opposed to someone who really understands this subject enough personally to make it more human as opposed to caricature and demeaning. On a technical level, the shaky camera and repetitive drone shots played into the worst visual cliches of modern filmmaking (as if one must show shaky camera footage when depicting poverty).",
247,22 May 2018,tarainsa,1, Foreign audiences beware of this.,"I write this as an NGO worker who was fortunate enough to travel to Cannes, as my husband is a journalist. There was no film I was more eager to see, as the subject is related to my exact profession, and I am a female film-lover always cheering on women directors. Let's just say I was left with far more love for the female-directed HAPPY AS LAZZARO. I work with street children in Lebanon. As a film-lover, I found the film a bit derivative of other films by Danny Boyle, especially in its speed and camera work. But as a human being close to this cause, the film angered me beyond belief. It is pornographic and exploitative as everyone is saying. The children are ""cutified"" if that could be a word, primed for a foreign audience. The Ethiopian was portrayed as a ""Magical Negro,"" clearly implanted into the story as a parachute. The parents are one-dimensional and monstrous, which is not the case typically at all. There is no credibility to the story. I hope for a powerful documentary that can serve as a rebuttal to what I can only and sadly describe as manipulative Oscar bait, very carefully -- and so savvily -- constructed for foreign audiences with good intentions who might not see how awful the film truly is.",

A very hard to watch movie because of its realistic approach to the life of those who suffered under war,humanitarian and the crises of globalisation.
I feel the movie was a bit too long and that at times it went too much for the easy tear drop of the spectator. Sometimes there was either too much or not enough emphasis on the different emotional scenes.

252,30 January 2021,jasonisaikaly,10, An uplifting hope in a broken homeless kid showed to those who lost the meaning of life.,"As a Lebanese filmmaker, I admit that Capharnaüm is one of the best film from Lebanon, and if you like this film I recommend ""The insult"" ""Ghadi"" ""And where do we go now"" and my first film ""Broken Truth"" and many other good Lebanese films. The drama feature films that Lebanon are putting are outstanding, there is not a bad movie, I'm talking objectively, because everyone have their own opinion on a movie.
Now when I first saw this movie in 2018, when it was released, I thought it was a good movie but I didn't connect with it. But when I rewatched it 2 days ago, I could not let it out of my mind, and I'm a one who watches 7 or 8 movies a day. So I wrote a conclusion of the film, and more I think about it, more it gets me sad.
This film is about a life of a poor yet homeless child, and meets people in his homeless times and try everything to stay alive and survive life, while everything turns bad for him, and when something good happens it only last a moment or two. We see in the beginning how he's saying in his heart that why I've born like this why we are so poor like someone whipping us off in the ground.
The message of Capharnaüm is that God don't leave anyone. That there is hope even when we are about to die. Teach us that you need to appreciate your life and gets satisfied with it because see how the homeless lives that they can't even guarantee to survive to another day.
What scary is that could happen to anyone in Lebanon or other countries, that a kid poor or well can become and live like Zayn without even thinking about it, this is why in this hard life you need to work, to get money to live, because you don't know what can happen in life, sure God do everything even letting me write this review but he can do to you things that are very hard and sad to teach you and you will be able to do it on earth before you can join him in heaven.
There is more that I want to talk about this wonderful film, that is directed so well by Nadine Labaki who has a great vision to movies, and you can tell by her two previous features. I wish I could talk more about this movie how it reflects the time that Lebanon are passing into, but we need to stay positive and increase the hope and thank God for EVERYTHING.",

In Lebanon you walk down the streets and see children working, selling gum, and dragging gas canisters miles down the road. The streets are always busy and the parents are nowhere to be found. The children are all exhausted and restless with dirt all around them. They don't get treated nicely and get beat up by any adult. Throughout the film you see a wide variety of different religious beliefs and different hierarchy classes. The story began with Zain and his parents in court. Zain had been a juvenile for stabbing someone and wanted to sue his parents for child neglect and for being born.",

Parents only care about their children, regardless of their upbringing, and treat their children as cash cow and free labor. Not only can they not bring happiness to children, but they will only bring suffering and torture to them. Now you need a certificate for everything you do, but you don't need a certificate for being a parent. However, not all people deserve to be parents, nor do they automatically become mothers when they have children. They only want to be happy for a while and let their children suffer together with them in this world. They are not worthy to be parents at all. If children cannot be given happiness, they should not have been born. They are your children, but they are their own. They have their own personality and ideas. They should not be abused, let alone trafficked. Parents have the obligation to discipline their children, and children have the right to bring their parents to court. Zane doesn't want anything. He just wants his parents to stop reproducing. Because before a person has learned how to be a qualified parent, Ta is not worthy of having children, let alone being a father (mother).",

Capernaum has been the recipient of many awards worldwide including, significantly, the Jury Prize at Cannes in 2018. The film's synopsis led me to thinking about the modern concept of childhood in general. Though the conditions which Zain is fighting in Capernaum are exceptional, it is interesting to note how children across the world, at an increasingly early age, are acting more like adults, to the point where an innocent childhood is perhaps bypassed completely.

294,26 February 2019,H_Mahran,7, tailor-made for hunting a festival prize?,"This is definitely one of the most intriguing, provocative, heart blowing and irritating movies I've ever watched, this is the type of movies that leaves you in a disturbed state of mind while gazing at the credits scrolling down on the screen, it's hard to formulate a solid impression on such movies, it's definitely impressive and humane, but not necessarily in a positive way.
First of all let me confess that I couldn't determine the logic behind the movie name, when I googled ""Capernaum"" I found out it's the name of a small Palestinian town overlooking the Sea of Galilee, the movie could be referring to it as the location where events are set, or it could be meant as just a symbol of any Arab city, however the movie held many clear indicators that it was set in Beirut and that the main character ""Zain"" was Lebanese.
I believe that the message meant by the movie is really significant and
substantial, people shall cease from bringing new children to the world unless they are capable of raising them up properly and of securing their basic needs of shelter, food, healthcare and education, I'm not quite sure whether Lebanon is suffering from a serious over-population issue or it was just a general message the makers of the movie wanted to deliver.
Nadine Labaki is a very talented and artistically-motivated director, here 2 previous movies (Caramel 2007 and Where Do We Go Now? 2011) have been wonderfully charming, this one, however, is much less entertaining, and that's - in my opinion - is its main issue, cinema after all is an entertainment art, I appreciate the joy I feel when watching a well-made movie, and there is a thin line between entertainment and message, every movie maker has to respect that line and keep his movie balanced between both, in this movie I've been constantly molested by ugly views of slums (not that the camera views were ugly but the places themselves were) and aggressive scenes, that started from the very first frame to the very last one throughout 2 hours, at least some nice landscapes or enchanting scenes would have helped interrupt this harsh atmosphere.
One other concern I have is the feeling that some movies nowadays, especially in the third world countries - and even in Hollywood and Europe but within different aspects - are being tailor-made for film festivals and academy awards, some approaches and subjects are being celebrated and carefully framed to qualify for hunting a festival prize, for example poverty, breach of human rights, forced marriage of minors, people trafficking, child labor, enslavement of refugees and foreign labor, etc., this movie is a perfect paradigm of such movies, I believe that Nadine's two previous movies were much more intimate, affectionate, well-focused and - above all - more cinematographically enchanting.",

I wanna reference one amazing review here by HadeelKouta who basically said all the things I wanted about the characters and the stories.
I just want to emphasize the amazing portrayals of characters which are mostly children. Baby Yonas whose relationship with Zain was so heartwarming, what a gigantic effort by director Nadine and the crew to establish that trust between those kids and let them lead the difficult story with such sensitivity.
Zain managed to portray all kinds of mature emotions that sadly kids in his condition has to bear. The huge responsibility of caring for and defending his sister while his parent neglected their kids to taking care of a toddler while trying to survive.
I can't get over some of the scenes that will haunt me and as Nadine said in the intro, I hope this impacts many as it did to me where now I'm looking into organizations that will help children in need and help put a smile on their face.
Finally I have to give high regards to the performance of the Ethiopian mother character Yordanos Shiferaw. I had to look her up expecting she won many awards in the festivals where this film was shown, I was shocked that there was no recognition to her. She definitely deserves an accolade for a breakthrough performance.

353,9 March 2020,faitheden,9, An Raw and Honest Masterpiece,"Review: Capernaum (2018)
Capernaum, 'chaos', follows the dismal struggle of Zain El-Hajj, a 12-year-old Lebanese boy suing his parents for the 'crime' of giving him, and his numerous siblings, life. At its premier at Cannes Film Festival in 2018, the screenplay, directed by Nadine Labaki, received a 15-minute standing ovation for its highly relevant and moving depiction of the increasingly dire situation for the majority living in Lebanon. Since October, nationwide protests have railed against government corruption and economic mismanagement, making Capernaum more relevant than ever, as it succeeds in depicting the resulting injustice of the poverty beckoned by years of growing crisis. According to a 2015 United Nations study, 77 percent of Lebanese residents were deprived in terms of economic status, but what film helps to achieve is the creation of pathos for the emotional and psychological effects of these stats, which increasingly fail to shock and evoke anger in our country, which seems to look more and more inwardly in its concerns and worries, with a certain 'every man for himself' attitude permeating politics and ethics in our post-Brexit era.
Zain, played by Syrian born actor Zain al-Rafeea, escapes his home in the slums of Beirut after his beloved sister is given away for marriage by their parents to a man twice her senior. While wondering the streets, he comes across Rahil, an immigrant hiding her undocumented son while working under a false identity. Zain becomes Yonas' primary carer and friend when Rahel is arrested, unbeknownst to him, and his suffering and desperation for survival is captured in his growing anger and frustration of his helpless situation as the film continues. Zain's character is not entirely separate from the actor's reality, as he grew up in the slums of Beirut himself after escaping the conflict in Syria, and was illiterate at the time of filming, so the integrity of his role is evident in his convincing and natural performance. Now living in Norway, he is a success story of children like Zain, his character in the film, who attempt to flee their conditions of poverty. The plot touches on Zain's desire and attempt to leave Lebanon by boat, an outcome which could have been disastrous had it succeeded, seeing as 3,740 deaths occurred among refugees at sea in 2016 alone. Instead, Zain ends up in prison for what he describes in court at the beginning of the film as 'stabbing a mother****er', whose identity is not revealed until later in the plot, leaving the audience unsure of what fate would have been worse.
Capernaum is ultimately a film of moral dilemmas, which we as a Western audience are forced to contemplate from a position of privilege, but which we are made sympathetic towards through the struggles of each character. What sits most uncomfortably is the role of the parents in the 'chaos', seeing as they enabled Zain and his siblings' misery through their neglect and irresponsible continuation of having more children than they could cope with. However, viewers will also come to see the injustice of one-sided blaming, as it is the system of government and a lack of help for citizens which also denies the basic desire to love and be loved, something achieved through parenthood. This dilemma stays with viewers for days, and I would recommend Capernaum to anyone feeling downhearted in their current situation, as it certainly puts into perspective our own problems with those of others across the globe.",

355,25 July 2020,palashahamed,9, Great Heart touching movie...,It's a best realistic and heart - touching film. Zain al rafeea acting was terrific.,
356,29 November 2018,zumbaabie,10," A story of chaos, forgiveness and peace.","The film has so many layers of complexity within it because of the many events that lead to its making.
During the mid 70s and into the early 90s, Lebanon was in war with Syria among other neighboring countries. The Syrian army invaded the country and controlled most of Northern Lebanon. Much destruction was caused in Beirut as a result of the constant war. What most people don't know is that Lebanon got bombed over and over by the Syrian army for almost two decades until its liberation from Syria in 2005.
Now keeping all of that in mind, the female director and mother of two children, Nadine Labaki (who endured this war), made this film with all this in mind.
Lebanon is actually smaller than Los Angeles county. It now harbors more Syrian refugees than the country can contain. Today, there are almost the same amount of Lebanese people as there are Syrian refugees. I was in Lebanon 3 years ago and it was shocking to see refugees living in the abandoned destroyed buildings that their army destroyed in Lebanon; Some are literally living in the skeletons of past destruction. Yet, with all that, the director Nadine Labaki chose a Syrian refugee, Zain, to star in her film. She could have easily chosen a Lebanese boy to play the role of a Lebanese child, but she chose him in particular for a reason.
In the end, this film, in my humble opinion, is really a story of peace and forgiveness and a call for the world to care for its children. After all, the children of today, are our future who will direct a new path in our world.
The Lebanese community is embracing the children of its once rival neighboring country that destroyed a good part of Lebanon less than two decades ago.
If Lebanon is able to forgive and forget to help the children, then any country should be able to the same.
The ending of the film was truly captivating. The peaceful smile of a child that just wants to belong, co-exist and live in peace.",

359,8 December 2018,sarinakedi,1, Cinéma-mensonge,"When journalists question Labaki about her ""film"", she mentions the great political cause that drove her to make it. She speaks of the misery she witnessed, the poor street children whom she drove by one day, her lucky young actor who was granted a visa to Norway thanks to her impactful film, etc. But she carefully avoids talking about... her film. She'd much rather talk about everything around it, leaving aside any potential ideas regarding her actual cinema. Why? Because she doesn't have a distinct cinematic voice, so she really doesn't have anything interesting to say about her own film. And because, as Godard said, ""cinema is a form that thinks and a thought that forms"", this complete lack of voice is obvious in her film, which is full of gimmicks, superfluous scenes, and an outrageous ""cathartic happy end"" worthy of a propaganda film: a (deplorable) government, a lawyer (shamelessly played by Labaki herself) and the media (known for their unprofessionalism) all contribute to rescue the hero, punish the bad guys and restore order and justice. (I say the Lebanese government is ""deplorable"" because it still practices torture, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, among a variety of other human rights violations). Formally, the film is shot with a Steadicam and the few drone shots are just there to highlight urban poverty. The fast-paced editing doesn't leave the audience time to actually look at faces and find genuine expressions in them. Our eyes are never free to wander around the frame - viewers don't even have time to think, because they're being held hostage by this chaotic and tearjerking mise-en-scene which desperately begs for their empathy but quickly becomes irritating.",

The prime responsibility is with the state, with the government, with the religion. The state is totally failed. The government is a whore of Hezbollah. The religion is of peace. The movie addresses the problem but is unable to propose anything. Politics is unavoidable when talking about the fate of children. Children are abused not because their parents are that bad, but because politicians playing cards with Lebanon and Syria are eval. Most children - caring peoples such as Iranians, Turks, Russians all have interests in Syria and Lebanon, and ended up failing the children in these two countries.

385,21 September 2018,adrianemelic,1, SKIP THIS FILM. DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE.,"It's pretty clear that the positive reviews here are biased. Anyone with a moral bone in their body can see this film for what it is from a mile away -- Oscar bait. This film follows a young boy (adorable, as the director clearly only casts people worthy of an advertisement) living with abusive parents. What follows is a series of tragedies that cover every single social issue the filmmaker could've stuffed into one film: lack of papers, child abuse, migration, child marriage...you almost expect her to throw in a three-legged dog just to force you into tears. If you want a compassionate look at people living through hardship, go see SHOPLIFTERS.",
386,5 April 2019,elgaudanas,7, A trip down deprivation lane,"As a cinematic experience, it was heavy and lengthy, with brilliant acting from Zain and Yonas. The adults were less Arab than the reality of Arab characters in such slumbs. The music was entertaining, but lacking.
I felt the sense of depravity in every single frame of the film. It was relatable and connected to hard realities across the Arab world, while overlooking state-role in poverty and deprivation.
It was a dialogue between the cast and God, with no mediation of intervention, Godly or not. Because by the last scenes, it is still open to interpretations and horrible events in the children's lives in other set scenarios.
The film was not trying to come up with solutions, which I see as a good point about it.Nadine did a wonderful job here.",
387,17 September 2019,joanneguarino,10, A masterpiece!,"I happened upon this movie and I am so glad I watched it. It is subtle emotional beauty in filmmaking, the emotional journey is portrayed with raw humanity at its core. It lost the academy award and I'm floored that it did not win. I saw Roma, the winner. I saw Capernaum. Zain, the main character, filled my heart with empathy. The story is a commentary on poverty, neglect and the will to survive. The director did a superb job in Capernaum!

He with his younger siblings has to do odd jobs along with their parents for living. He wants to go to school, but his father refuses. Zain's mind has grown up early than his physical body, for everyday is a fight for existence. Zain protests when his father tries to sell their sister Sahar to a pervert shopkeeper for some chickens. As Zain's protest fails, he flees from home and meets with a Ethiopian refugee Rahil and her son from where all of their life changes very deeply.
This is a story of thousands of families living in many parts of the world. This is not very easy to put the intense realism into a full length movie. Nadine Labaki's research was well suited for this movie. All actors did a fabulous job building their characters. The Oscar was well deserved.
