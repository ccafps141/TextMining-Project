1,11 October 2018,keving4241,10, The only movie my grandfather couldn't finish,My grandfather fought in WW2 somehow surviving D-Day. He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I'll give that movie a good ripping one day.,r
2,27 August 2011,classicsoncall,10," ""Sergeant, we have crossed some strange boundary here. Our world has taken a turn for the surreal"".","I read four or five pages of reviews for this film on the IMDb boards, and most of them fall into one of two camps - those who felt it was the best, or at least one of the best war movies ever made - and the Spielberg bashers who decry the very fact that America and it's Allies had even the slightest audacity to win the War. Granted, the concept of good Americans versus evil Nazis is a bit too simplistic when it comes to cinematic treatments. Those viewers who want to read so much of that into the picture are missing one of Spielberg's main goals - 'How do you find decency in the hell of warfare'? That question reverberates around the central plot, the mission to rescue a sole surviving brother who's three siblings have all perished in the same war already. For the eight members of the rescue team, the quandary is presented in terms of moral prerogatives - why potentially sacrifice so many soldiers at the expense of just one, who may already be dead anyway?

3,16 August 1999,ToldYaSo,9," War is hell, and ""Saving Private Ryan"" peeks into the gates of Hades","I'd heard a couple of startling things about this film before seeing it. I'd heard that many veterans were having a hard time getting through the film without breaking down. I'd also seen interviews with veterans who'd seen the film and found the film to be incredibly realistic and consequently difficult to watch. Intriguing comments, since we all know there is no shortage of films about war from this century.",v

Why? Not sure really – I'm not the world's biggest fan of Steven Spielberg, although I'll admit that he's made some good films in his time. Still, it was with some excitement that I sat down to finally watch this lengthy epic of a film, in the best format possible – widescreen DVD, 52"" television, and surround sound system. Unsurprisingly, I was blown away by the production.",i

10,24 January 2000,Hitchcoc,8, Horrors of War,"There's violence and there's violence. With the huge numbers of personal reviews of this movie, I'm hard pressed to add much. The first half hour affected me like no other in recent years. I wondered as the boys threw up on the amphibious carriers whether they were seasick or scared beyond belief. When one uses the expression ""cannon fodder"" so casually, do we realize that this means the second wave makes it's way to the beach over the dead and dying bodies of the first wave, like ants sacrificing themselves to ford a puddle. The ones that get through, get through because there are only so many bullets and so many people. They are exposed, disoriented, helpless--they have no place to go but ahead. I will be haunted forever by the soldier searching, then finding his dismembered arm in the carnage. I will remember those trying to get above water, only to be cut down below the surface. If anyone has a heart, his or her attitude toward war should never be the same. How can we who have never been there have a hint of what it must have been like. Like Schindler's List on the Holocaust, this should be a training film on war.",6

This is probably considered one of the greatest movies of all time and it is directed by Speilberg. The movie is incredable. The beginning was horrifying. I couldn't believe how accurate it was and painful it was to watch. When I studied WW2 in high school, I thought no one could ever re-create the Beach of Normady. But Speilberg did. I felt like I was there with the soldiers. I felt their fear, pride, and love for their country. I couldn't believe how much dedication our armies put into fighting and winning the war.

You've probably heard about the amount of violence, blood, and gore and that's all true--it's got the Viet Nam movie style violence (and then some) but it's not gratuitous. Were it sanitized like early WWII movies, modern audiences probably wouldn't take it as seriously.",2

19,12 May 2015,adammfeeley,10, One of the best war films ever made.,This film is an absolute masterpiece. It shows that war isn't always glamorous. Steven Spielberg won a Best Directing Oscar for his work on this film and the film went on to win four others. It is gritty and bloody and it shows that wars aren't won by weapons but by soldiers. The cast shine as the group of soldiers tasked with finding Private Ryan. Along the way they encounter the harsh truth and real meaning of war. It boasts impressive battle sequences and the stylish cinematography makes the film truly beautiful. The opening beach sequence is possibly the greatest opening scenes in movies. Tom Hanks is spell binding as the commander who has no idea about the harsh truth of war. Overall a truly amazing film.,r

22,17 March 2005,jboothmillard,9, Saving Private Ryan,"Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Jurassic Park) deservedly won the Oscar for directing Schindler's List, and he did it again with another World War II film, this time in the battle itself, he was also won the Golden Globe, and was nominated the BAFTA. Basically the film starts with the fantastic opening on Ohama beach with Captain John H. Miller (Oscar BAFTA nominated, and medal for Distinguished Public Service Award (highest US Navy Civilian honour) winning Tom Hanks) and his troops struggling for survival against the Nazi Germans. After surviving this, they are given a special mission that they don't understand the significance of, to find one man and bring him home. They are now on the search for Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), and when they eventually find him, he doesn't know why he is needed to get home. This film may have its annoying chats and breakaways from battle, probably why it's four out of five stars, but this still sticks closer to the truth than fiction.

Stanley Mellish, Vin Diesel as Private Adrian Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as T-4 Medic Irwin Wade, Jeremy Davies as Cpl. Timothy P.

24,15 November 2006,aimless-46,2, Wise Up People,"War films can be broken into two basic categories; the propaganda film, which celebrates bravery and patriotism; and the anti-war film, which shows the suffering and futility of war. The most extreme propaganda films are usually produced when a war is threatened or actually in progress and either demonize or belittle the individual enemy soldier. This is useful for both inspiring the home front and for assuring it that there will be an ultimate victory. While these films play well with a wartime audience they appear somewhat silly when viewed in a post-war environment. ",t

Skydiver somewhere in northern France. Only recently, after some research, did I discover that the film was based, very slightly, on a real event. The script is good, full of action scenes and will surely delight the lovers of war movies and WWII movies.

Yes, they may use American actors and show American fighting, but look past that and see the terrifying experiences of war and the fear of the people back home who suffer the emotional trauma. 'Saving Private Ryan' I felt gave a visual look at war, it gave the best feeling of what war would be like that any movies have given, but I don't think that any movie ever will be able to to give the exact fear that is within the people when they are in the middle of a battlefield.",

If he wants to make us inch the blanket up over our eyes, he'll crank up the grim orchestral music and put us face-to-face with a toothy Great White.

The opening sequence gained notoriety for it's unflinching visceral photography and shockingly graphic violence. I have watched this film a few times since then, but seeing it on a larger screen, I had an appreciation for the realism that Spielberg insisted on. If it was virtually any other filmmaker, the expense of realistic production with extra attention to detail would not have happened.

35,14 September 2003,dbdumonteil,6, some upsetting battle sequences for a plain story,War movies have often been one of Steven Spielberg' specialities. This one achieved a huge public and critic success. What drew the attention in this war movie are fight sequences. They're extremely violent and bloody.

52,6 June 2022,nickenchuggets,10, Their finest hour,"78 years ago today, American soldiers during World War 2 went through what is possibly the closest thing to Hell on Earth. Even though this movie is relatively new, it has already become a prime example of how influential films can be when expertly crafted. It seems like because of SPR, we have way more second world war enthusiasts than we used to. This is a testament to how well made this film really is, and even over 20 years later, it hits hard and is quite disturbing. The plot concerns itself with Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) leading a squad of US Army Rangers sent into France during the landings at Normandy in order to retrieve the titular paratrooper (Matt Damon) whose three brothers were killed in combat. The story is told as a flashback, with an elderly Ryan visiting a french cemetery with his present day family. He stops in front of a particular grave and starts to remember his (and Miller's) experiences during that horrible war. Miller and his men attack the beaches at Normandy during D-day, and what follows is a bloodbath. American soldiers are killed with ease by German machine gunners perched high above the sand in tall bunkers. With storms of gunfire raging around him and everyone else on the beach, Miller manages to lead his squad through german barbed wire emplacements and destroy the bunkers from the rear. In the immediate aftermath, Miller receives a new assignment after he learns of a Private James Ryan of Iowa and how all 3 of his brothers were killed. Miller and several other soldiers are ordered to find him and bring him to safety so that his family will have at least one of their sons back. After setting off, Miller and the others come to a small french village where they are ambushed by a german sniper concealed in a tower. The sniper manages to fatally wound PFC Caparzo (Vin Diesel) before he's countersniped by the squad's god-fearing marksman, Private Jackson (Barry Pepper). Already having lost one man to enemy action, the squad starts having doubts about whether saving Ryan is worth the trouble. This gets intensified later on when Miller and the others attack a german machine gun post even though they could have just as easily bypassed it. The resulting charge gets another member of the squad (field medic Wade) killed, and the soldiers try to exact their revenge on the only german soldier that survived the fight. Often referred to as Steamboat Willie, he is about to be executed by Miller's men when Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies) voices his concerns. He tells Miller it's not right to shoot an unarmed person, even if he did kill Wade, so the german prisoner is blindfolded and let go into the countryside. After talking to some more Allied soldiers, Miller eventually locates Ryan and is led to the town of Ramelle by him. John gives him the bad news, but he still makes clear his orders don't involve him abandoning his friends. Ryan ultimately refuses to leave, forcing the others to instead stay in Ramelle with him and hope they survive the coming battle. German forces attack the town with tanks and swarms of infantry since it contains a bridge which hasn't been blown up yet. Because Ryan and Miller's respective squads are almost out of ammo, they devise a plan to bait the germans into driving their tanks into an ambush location using a tracked motorcycle vehicle called a Kettenkrad. One german tank doesn't fall for it and rumbles past the street, but the second one turns and starts heading towards the squad. With everyone in their ambush positions, the GI's manage to blow off one of the tank's tracks with explosive devices, disabling it. After killing its crew, it now blocks the road for the other german vehicles. The german forces bring in additional soldiers as well as a mobile 20 millimeter flak gun, which literally rips human bodies in half. Many of Miller's soldiers are killed in the action, including Jackson. As the situation starts to favor the germans more and more, the defending americans announce it is time to blow the bridge. The survivors take defensive positions and try to keep shooting in order to buy time. Suddenly, Miller decides to put himself in the line of fire and is fatally shot by the very same german soldier Upham convinced him to let go. Upham, who was too afraid to participate in the fighting earlier, redeems himself by shooting Steamboat Willie. As Miller dies, he tells Ryan to ""earn this"", but nothing more than that. Back in the present, an old Ryan salutes Miller's grave and tells him he has tried to earn back all the favors his comrades did for him that day. If you've never seen this movie, I would definitely encourage you to do so, especially if you like ww2 related things. Just to be clear, I don't think it's something that is really meant to be enjoyed, as this is one of the most violent and shocking films you'll ever watch. The opening 20 minutes during the normandy attack are the foremost example, with the entire sequence being so brutal and gory that many ww2 veterans actually had to leave the theater. We see men getting their legs blown off by german artillery, some of them getting shot in the neck and then suffocating, and soldiers being burned alive on exploding landing ships. What makes it so sad is how all this actually happened. In fact, I don't doubt the real experience on Omaha Beach was worse. It's unfortunate because Omaha was the only one of the five beaches attacked that day that was truly a nightmare, as the other ones provided relatively little resistance. Omaha was a defender's dream with high cliffs and machine guns everywhere. Just because the first 20 minutes of the film are so distressing, this doesn't mean the rest of the film is (mostly). SPR has a lot of comic relief moments, where the men talk about things before the war that made them laugh and feel safe. It's important to have these things in a film like this for obvious reasons, and I'm sure the people who were in the war itself kept themselves going with similar stories. As expected from such an acclaimed movie, the acting here is all amazing. Obviously because Ryan is the focus of the movie, most would think he's the main character, but most of the runtime focuses on Miller. Tom Hanks does an incredible job of portraying this man, and he's one of the first things that comes to my mind when I hear the word ""leader"". Tasked with a morally challenging mission, he wonders all the time if saving Ryan is actually worth it, but has to appear strong to the men he commands. He is tough, but he has limits. All soldiers do. Matt Damon is great as Private Ryan, since he is shown to be fearless in most situations. His initial reaction to getting sent home is not a happy one, as he wants to die defending his friends. The rest of the cast is also memorable, with my favorite squad member probably being Jackson, since he knows God is always on his side. Overall, Saving Private Ryan is a fantastic movie and one of the best of the ww2 genre. It's very hard to watch at times, but it makes you realize how important ww2's central message was: how dictatorships need to be stopped before they can threaten the world.",
53,3 November 2007,lee_a_scott,7, Not as great as you've heard,"When I first saw this film at the cinema I was, like everyone else in the world, blown away by the opening scenes and then mostly entranced by what followed. Upon re-watching it these years later, the overall effect has been lessened by familiarity and, possibly, by being Speilberged out after watching Munich last week! The battle scenes are still excellent  visceral, terrifying and all too real  conveying the calamitous confusion of war in a way seldom matched in the movies. When the action slows down, so does the film, and this often leaves you feeling a little disinterested as the characters lack of back-story and overly obvious attempts at making them look good (Woo! I've saved a child! Boo! I've been shot!) seem to jar with the realism attained elsewhere. It's still a cracking film though, and the weaker bits have actually stood up better than the strong bits in my opinion (although maybe I'm just more tolerant of schmaltz as I get older).",

The action kicked ass and the battles of the entire film was phenomenal but not only that the plot was as great as can be. About Capt. John Miller and seven soldiers looking for just one other soldier who all of his brothers were killed and return him back home. The movie was also deeply sad and I kept feeling sorry for the soldiers and I always felt that I wanted to just go into the movie and fight for U.S. This is the best war movie of all time and it will remain the same unless some other comes up and overpass it but for now this is a masterpiece!!!,

It is among the few that truly capture the impact and scale of war, while still managing to tell an amazingly put together story as well. The first 20 mins of this film is one of the most intense, insane, realistic looking things I've ever seen. Back when I watched this for the first time on Memorial Day of 2020, I don't think I'd ever seen anything quite like this before, and was not prepared at all for the sheer realism. I was still early on in my film watching days, so this really moved me. To this day, it remains my 2nd favorite movie ever. Steven Spielberg really did create a masterpiece out of this, and I'm very happy that he did. For being someone known for making all those nostalgic 80s kids type movies (like E.

I had originally seen it in a movie theater, during its initial release, and I hated it. The second time was certainly not a charm. Possessing the knowledge of what was to come, made for an even more boring movie experience. This film's much talked about opening, lends nothing to the paltry narrative that is the rest of the film. The movie meanders about, aimlessly, for what seems an eternity, and almost nothing happens. When something does happen, it isn't anything that you haven't seen, done by the same old characters that you've seen before, in countless other (and better) WWII films. Even the dialog is old Hollywood corny. Then, after being about virtually nothing for hours, it ends with a hokey gimmick of the realization of who the old Vet is. Meant to tug at our heartstrings (nothing wrong with that); but only elicited a groan and a roll of the eyes from me. Tedious, with virtually no character development. Not Recommended.",
63,6 June 2013,ironhorse_iv,9, This film is a masterpiece. A tribute to the greatest generation and those who serve during WWII.,"The fact that it didn't win Best Picture is outrageous. It was great from start to finish. The opening scene with the old man crumble in front of headstones is emotional. The music score by John Williams is amazing. That image became the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg. The film tells the story of a mission following the D-day invasion. The movie starts Tom Hanks as Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who must takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. His mission to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) and bring him back to the United States so that it can save the family's bloodline and help softly the mother's grief. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore starts as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance. I understand the everyman quality of the average soldier. There were also a lot of actors that you wouldn't have thought for once, playing soldiers as supporting characters such as Ted Danson, Bryan Cranston and Paul Giamatti. Who knew they would be playing soldiers in one of the greatest war film ever. I like how the characters were written with everyday blue-collar Joes. It gives the movie realistic. They are brave while scare. Good, but also bit morally reprehensible. A great scene toward the middle of the film represented the questioning of their own morals when it conflict the attitudes of the war when the group captured a German Soldier. All of them has to debate if they should just murder the man or set the man free. It's toward the middle of the film, that the violence of the film dies down enough, to get a few character development. It was strong enough time to make them seem like people with the amount of screen time they got here. Some people thinks that the movie glorified war or it's over patriotism. I think some critics seriously misinterpreted this movie if they think it glorified war. In movies that glorify war, there are ridiculous outlandish characters that simply don't represent the soldiers who fought in war. In Saving Private Ryan, the characters are down-to-earth-ordinary. This movie also shows that in war, there are no heroes who are guaranteed to survive. It portrays war as what it is: violent and ugly. As pure hell. As for patriotism, I don't believe that the film is patriotism. There are scenes of American soldiers being as crude, cowardly, or just mean-spirited as some of the German's soldiers. I don't think the Germans are portray unfairly. About the fact that there were no allied forces shown was due to the fact that it is an American film presented to an American audience. Would it had been nice to see a British soldier in the film? Yes, but it wasn't needed in the film. The film made younger generations understand what happened that day and the sacrifices that were made in order to win that war, while also telling the dangers and how bad the war really got. The film was balance between pro war and anti-war themes. Yes, there were a few historic accurates that wasn't corrected, but overall, many people have call this film to be the most realistic and maybe the best war film ever. The first 20 minutes horrifically and realistically depicts the Normandy Invasion. The visuals are grainy, de-colorized, and filmed in a first person aspect that convey an adrenalin driven that been never witness in a war film before then, and since after Saving Private Ryan, many directors have used for their war films. The audio is astounding, and actually had me flinching during the harrowing first twenty minutes of the film. Exceedingly realistic and recorded in perfect three dimensional, positional audio that firmly plants you on that horrific beach landings. After this movie came out, I saw an interview with several D-Day survivors. They all said that the invasion sequence was the most realistic portrayal they had ever seen. It was like they were there again. That is strong praise from someone who would know. Every teen aged idiot who fantasizes on war by playing console games needs to watch this film. Show them how it really was. It's not what it is. Overall: It is a must-watch. It's a story of normal, average men forced into extraordinary and terrible situations due to war and how they survive it.",

65,5 August 2005,PWNYCNY,8, War is Unpleasant,"The movie has a lot of gratuitous scenes of violence (Don't need Hollywood to show me that war is a violent activity). The movie has a lot of stereotypical characters (Don't need Hollywood to portray soldiers as being foul-mouthed and grimy). The movie has a pretentious story (Don't believe that even the U. S. Army would risk 10 soldiers to locate one, and an enlisted solder at that, in the middle of one of the biggest operations in the history of warfare). But what saves this movie from being a complete dud is Tom Hanks's portrayal of Captain Miller. Hanks's performance is not just wonderful, it is superlative. Captain Miller is a civilian who now finds himself in combat and the conflict between his civilian background and military responsibilities is what this movie is about. Because of this conflict, Captain Miller suffers, emotionally as well as physically. We observe how Captain Miller goes through a process of breaking down as his situation becomes more and more untenable. And when the private in question is found, yet refuses to leave, Captain Miller begins to completely unravel as he realizes that his mission has failed and that the men in his unit who died - under Captain Miller's command - had died in vain. Captain Miller literally becomes a nervous wreck, but nevertheless he fights on, courageous and strong till the ultimate moment arrives marking the end of Captain Miller's life. For Captain Miller is a hero and his character is symbolic of every citizen-soldier who answered the call to duty, and made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.",

It is one of the most spectacular introduction to the film. You have a cast that includes Spielberg's favorite actor, Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Paul Giamati, one of my personal favorites-Rolf Saxon in a non-speaking role. This film is mostly a male-dominated film with little or no romance. SPielberg's best asset is creating a spectacular image and this time, the landing on Normandy was not for the easily sickened. You will see the graphic display of the horror on that day which is what we should see. HE does not shy away from showing us human brutality at its worst but he later shows it at it's best. I didn't care much for the title about them rescuing one soldier to bring home. I wanted Steven Spielberg to know that this is his best film to date about World War II even surpassing Schindler's List which I felt was inferior to this film. The script was superb, the movie is just a breathtaking spectacle to date. It still should be seen in the movie theaters to show the effects and brutality and to remind us about how cruel war is on any level. he won the Oscar for best director but after seeing Shakespeare in Love, there is no doubt in my mind that Saving Private Ryan was robbed of Best Film.

The infamous ""first 20 minutes"" -- was touted as a super-realistic hardline look at the horrors of combat. Hint: Look elsewhere, such as in Mel Gibson's outstandingly raw combat scenes in ""We Were Soldiers."" Spielberg's opening combat scenes are a dreadful special effects show, and any viewer involvement falls flat for lack of either character development or contact with Earth. When fighting a war, it's better to not send cowards or airheads to do a man's job. The same can be said for making movies about war.

The movie follows soldiers in the 75th ranger regiment as they land on the beaches of Normandy. (best scene in the movie). Tom Hanks is then given an assignment to rescue Matt Damon and bring him home because all of his other brothers were killed in combat. So almost every man from Hanks' squad dies but eventually Ryan gets saved. The Germans, of course are all incredibly unnattractive brutish men. In reality the war was fought by a bunch of twenty-somethings on all sides who had no idea what they were getting into. But the Hanks-Spielberg team completely redeemed themselves with band of brothers. So do yourself a favor, skip renting this, pay a couple bucks more and pick up all ten episodes of B of B. It's a true story based on real heroes of WWII, and the acting is not bad. Thats all. Save your money if you want to see saving private ryan, wait for it to come on ABC.",

105,23 October 2003,KenLiversausage,3, Typical saccharine pap from Spielberg,"The greatest war movie ever?  Come on, folks, who are you trying to kid. While SPR is certainly a technical tour de force, in emotional, spiritual, historical and narrative terms it stinks, for the same reason most of Spielberg's films (with the exception of Schindler's List, marvellous) stink:  the man has no vision, and little or no artistic integrity.  (Why else does he churn out rubbish like Jurassic Park II? I'll tell you why - money.)",
106,28 June 2005,dee.reid,10, War is hell after all...,"It seemed impossible (or was it inevitable?), but director Steven Spielberg did the unthinkable: he made a war movie. The creative and legendary mind behind such kiddie movies like ""E.T. the Extraterrestrial"" (1982) or ""Hook"" (1991) and who had ventured into more mature territory with ""Schindler's List"" (1993) made a movie that put a human face on the horrors of the World War II conflict. We know how personal WWII is to Spielberg (especially to anyone who's seen ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" - he just loves to stick it those diabolical Nazis, or the aforementioned ""Schindler's List""), but after seeing ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), our assertions at just HOW personal it is to him are revealed. Opening on D-Day (June 6, 1944) at Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, the grainy cinematography and jerky camera movements are relentlessly imposing in capturing the graphic battlefield carnage of that day. We watch in horror as one after one, Allied soldiers are butchered by the automatic weapons being unloaded on them by the Germans that had taken up positions on the hills in front of them. In the middle of the chaos, is Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), as he leads his men from the sandy, bullet and body-riddled beach up to the top of the hill. In the scenes that follow, Spielberg is unflinching as we see American soldiers as well Germans become the casualties of history's costliest conflict. The movie doesn't end there; it's only the beginning and the main plot of the film, which is supposedly based on a true story, takes shape. It turns out, that an American mother is going to receive three telegrams in one day, each one informing her that her three sons have all been killed in the D-Day invasion. But there is hope: her fourth son, a paratrooper, the eponymous Private Ryan (Matt Damon, in what could essentially be considered a cameo) of the film's title, survived. The problem is, he's located deep behind enemy lines, and it'll take a small squad of American soldiers to bring him home, as word of this small victory will serve the army good on the home front. Miller leads his squad, which includes Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Private Reiben (Edward Burns), Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), T-4 Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) and the unproven translator Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies), deep into the French countryside to rescue Private Ryan and bring him home. It should be stated foremost that this is not an easy movie to sit through. I remember hearing stories from when this film first came about out how WWII veterans who were at D-Day had to be escorted out of the theaters because it was too much for them to handle. But still, that is its goal: ""Saving Private Ryan"" is the most realistic, gritty, and horrifically violent war movie I've ever seen. It does the impossible task of shedding itself of the stigmas (patriotic flag-waving, one-dimensional soldiers, one-sided portraits of the enemy, no battle-related carnage, etc.) that haunted many WWII films made during the '50s and '60s; contrary to some reviews, none of this goes on in this film. The film is immediately effective in its portrait of soldiers on both sides of the WWII battle, and the cost it waged on them. The performances are flawless, as Spielberg is able to get commanding talent out of all the actors involved. The action, if you can sit through it, will definitely make you squirm in your seat at how realistic it is. It should also be noted that nearly every war film since this one has tried to mimic the style of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but they can't ever live up to its originality and raw intensity. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is Spielberg's WWII masterpiece, and is my favorite war movie. It's no wonder Spielberg was voted #1 director of all time; this film proves why.",

After the invasion on the beach, the chills and thrills continue, as the soldiers have to go behind enemy lines to retrieve Ryan. This is one of the finest war films ever made.

As a way to involve the audience in an immersive experience of war, this is a perfectly mastered technique. However, the amount of disorientation can be excessive, as I often had trouble hearing the dialogue or distinguishing which soldiers were on which side. Other than that, the toll on the soldiers becomes the main emotional crux of the film although I felt that this pathos was quite forced at times - how many times can we hear a dying soldier cry for their ""mama""?

It's held up exceptionally well over time, most likely due to the great lengths taken by Spielberg and company to stamp it down in a specific era and remain steadfastly historical. The Normandy beach landing that opens the action is still as powerful and haunting as ever, an effects showcase like none other that puts us right down in the middle of hell itself. I couldn't help but pontificate about the futility of ground warfare here, faced with row after row of doe-eyed teenagers, unceremoniously mowed down before taking so much as a single step on enemy territory. Which is part of its message, no doubt - though that's somewhat countered by the tales of bravado, camaraderie and character that sprawl out over the next two hours. A richly rounded war story, it enjoys a mess of acting performances even stronger than the work of the effects team. Tom Hanks is at the top of the mountain as Captain Miller, a demanding role that he owns from moment one. Supporting faces pop out of the woodwork at every corner; most of us remember Vin Diesel and Adam Goldberg in early roles, but quick shots from Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Bryan Cranston and more left my jaw agape. How did I miss spotting these guys the last time? A true epic, profound and moving, with plenty of action but just as much character-building and adventure also in the mix.

I have read numerous reputable books and watched award winning documentaries about WW2 and viewed a long list of films featuring various parts of the war but nothing I had heard about this film prepared me for the opening sequence. I doubt there is anyone on this planet who would not be affected in one way or another by it. You can get a dictionary out and list the adjectives but those 22 minutes are infinitely more descriptive than centuries of books, unrealistic films and fancy speeches. The whole film is close on three hours and is and hopefully always will be an education for anybody watching. For me this film should be regarded like a monument to all the people who have gone to war irrespective of when or where it took place or why it started in the first place. I suspect that the real thing was worse than what is shown in the film but what is shown is graphic enough. We have been killing each other for centuries but this like a select few other films lays it all out realistically.

Steven Spielberg's epic scopic vision set in WWII emerses you from its grueling opening 25 minutes of you-are-there depiction of the battle of Omaha Beach, Normandy during D-Day grippingly depicts hell on earth with all its graphic carnage that is relentless in its harrowing approach only underscores the unfolding plot of saving one man's life: a true metaphor never ringing hollow. Hanks gives another patented beautiful performance as Capt. John Miller, the dispatched leader of an Army Rangers squad to find Pvt. James Ryan (Damon), the sole living son after his three active duty siblings are killed during battle. Leading what would only be called a Hollywood stereotypical troop of outspoken, griping Brooklynite Mick (Burns); built-to-kill Italian grunt who's writing a letter home (Diesel); gospel-spouting Southern sharpshooter (Pepper, a nice stand-out to root for); the token walking-conscience Jew (Goldberg); the medic with a heart of gold (Ribisi also excellent); and the never-seen-combat interpreter/journalist (Davies, ditto). The script by Robert Rodat, who incorporates the true life accounts of The Fighting Sullivans, who all perished at war, makes compelling characters come to life and one gets the sense of really pulling for these men on a literal look for a 'needle in a stack of needles'. Like 'Schindler's List' the film stands on its own; only this case instead of saving hundreds of lives, the precious gift of one only permeates the universal message: all life is precious, even if it seems fruitless for 8 men to sacrifice for it. Hanks clearly gives the film its soul with an incredibly nuanced turn as a school teacher on the frontline clearly feeling the end may be near given his ever exapanding right hand tic and his only hope of seeing his beloved wife stateside again on a mission as desperate as the bigger picture ('winning the war'). Spielberg outdoes himself by making arguably the most realistic and least sensationalistic war film ever made and that's saying something with the polemics of 'Platoon' and surreal imagery of 'Apocalypse Now' still reverberating the echoes of The War Film. Brilliantly filmed by Spielberg collaborator/cinematographer wunderkind Janusz Kaminksi, the camera suitably goes terror-laden trenches with its documentarian air about it and slightly grainy, yet gorgeous photography. The violence may be the hardest element to stomach but in light of its subject matter it certainly is not inappropriate; one will never actually feel what living in a war is like unless having fought one. Spielberg and company should be proud for its authenticity. Also of note: Dale Dye, a longtime military film adviser/actor (he has a cameo during the planned rescue debriefing), prepped the actors with rigorous boot camp training that clearly pays off. Arguably one of the best films ever made and ultimately cheated of Best Picture (losing out to - oh PLEASE! - 'Shakespeare in Love') but scored 5 Academy Awards including the deserved Best Director for Spielberg, Kaminski for Best Cinematography, Editing, Sound Effects and Sound Effects Editing.",

All Quiet On The Western Front, Full Metal Jacket, and Platoon are some of my favorites. Glory an Braveheart are also extremely good. Saying this is the best war movie ever is tough. Apocalypse Now, FMJ, and Platoon are all great movies but don't have as great a plot or anything approaching the cinematography of this movie. The cinematography of the opening battle scene is by far the greatest 15 minutes in the history of film technique. It has to be experienced on a theater screen and up close to get the full feeling of the sheer insanity that takes place in the midst of a battle. The story that follows the super impressive opening is no less genius. It's a great Dr Strangelove feel of conflicting morals, interests, and sanity. Tom Hanks,Tom Sizemore do wonderful acting jobs and I'm not quite sure who plays the sniper but he steals the movie from everyone. Great writing and attention to detail including actual Panzer tank sounds rack up more points for this movie. The violence much like any real war has quite a humbling effect. And the backdrop of D-Day (often called the greatest battle in history) provides the perfect opportunity to show how horrible death really is. Actual veterans went into siezers, flashbacks, and emotional trauma when viewing this movie. A help line was even set up to help them cope with the visions. That really says a lot about a film.",
151,12 April 2016,baberchik,5, Cheezy feel-good nonsense,"I some times wonder if Spielberg is one of those contributors to modern anti-semitism in the sense that everything he does is so incredibly cheezy, so old-school outdated cinema style with all that long, soggy melodrama, those tell-tale ""musical effects"" or whatever one calls that ambient background music that changes along with the scenes in the movie... this is funny because one can GUESS without looking at who's the director by just listening carefully 10-20 minutes into the movie that Spielberg is the director... it's literally that obvious. I am not sure if ""Uncle Zoid"" from that one Futurama episode was a deliberate satirical stab at Spielberg or the same kind of outdated directors as he is, but that one episode summed it up perfectly. Anyhoo..... Unlike the Shoah cash-cow ""Shindler's List"" which was made with such severe historic digressions that even Shindler's actual real life family complained about it - in this movie Spielberg takes on what is possibly one of the best paying gigs in the entire US-viewer oriented genres of movies: feelgood American war heroes. Not just that, but in the finest way possible; as in a handful of guys take on half of Wehrmacht who are of course complete morons who have no idea how to shoot straight... and the main aim of their heroic K/D ratio of 100:1 in the movie is... *US patriotism intensifies*... to save a private who's already advanced very far in the war, because Uncle Sam said enough of his family members died. Ugh... And while U-Boot was the antithesis of this movie in absolutely every regard, Spielberg took no notes what so ever. The same way how USA today makes up historical drama about what it did or did not do, the same way does Spielberg make movies.",

This movie (set during WWII) tells the story of a group of soldiers (led by Army captain Tom Hanks) who go into France to find a private who's three brothers were killed in action, and send him home. The opening 30 minute D-Day sequence is one of the most harrowing movie scenes ever filmed. The story is exceptional, the directing is brilliant, and the acting is excellent. Tom Hanks is terrific as usual, and is supported by an outstanding cast which includes Matt Damon (""Good Will Hunting""), Tom Sizemore (""Black Hawk Down""), Edward Burns (""She's the One""), Vin Diesel (""The Fast and the Furious""), Adam Goldberg (""A Beautiful Mind""), Jeremy Davies (""Twister""), Barry Pepper (""61*""), Giovanni Ribisi (""subUrbia""), and Ryan Hurst (""Remember the Titans""). Some of these actors have gone on to bigger things since this movie but they're all good here. Popular TV star Ted Danson (TV's ""Cheers"" and ""Becker"") and veteran character actor Dennis Farina (""Midnight Run"" and ""Get Shorty"") even turn up in cameos. ""Saving Private Ryan"" should have won the Best Picture Oscar for 1998 because it's a war movie that's harrowing and powerful. It did go on to win 5 Oscars including Spielberg's Best Director win.

The opening scene is spectacular and extremely violent, but then that was how the Allies managed to get over the English channel and over to France. The movie is very good, it has both realistic war-scenes and great drama(although The Thin Red Line focuses more on drama).

Perhaps because of the special effects (those first 20 minutes are indeed horryfying) but the sole reason why that is like that is just because ""Saving private Ryan"" is the kind of warmovie they don't make any longer, but believe me, if ""The longest day"" or any other warepic would have been made these days it would have been exactly the same as this Spielbergmovie. Surely not a bad movie at all, even worth your time (and even more than that) but Spielberg tries a bit too hard to make it an anthem to those who lost their live in one of the biggest tragedies the world has known, but then again every war is a tragedy (I see no difference in a soldier dying in France or somewhere in Palestina). Spielberg is not afraid to show the cruelity of war and if you are softhearted you will close your eyes more than once. Good movie, even a bit more than that but just don't overrate it as well.",

While its portrayal of the horrors of war was supposed to be profoundly shocking, I found it all rather amusing in a sick sort of way myself, and during the initial scenes where the Allies were landing at Normandy and getting massacred, I found myself inflamed with feelings of BESTIAL WARLUST and smirking rather evilly at various particularly violent and/or gory moments (eg where that troop carrier opens up, only to have its entire human cargo mowed down in seconds by German machine gunners).

It actually improved a bit on re-watch, though I still find that my problems with it back then have not at all disappeared. My main problem is (and was) that Spielberg really seems to think this film is some deep anti-war statement, some extremely important existential story, and it's just not. At heart, this is very much like the WWII classics The Story of G.I. Joe and Battleground (both directed by the great William A. Wellman), about a group of fairly stereotypical and not all that well defined soldiers who risk their lives for a greater purpose. Sure, they are constantly asking the question ""Is it worth it?"", but Spielberg's (painfully corny) wraparound story, with Private Ryan visiting Arlington National Cemetery, answer that question with a resounding ""DUH!"" Not to mention that the whole existential crisis (why should eight men be sent to die for one?) is a fabricated one, anyway, as it is, after all, fiction. And, during the film's release, we were told over and over again by everyone involved with the film and very gullible film critics that this was an anti-war movie (one of them who could see through that just saw fit to tell us how much more awesome Joe Dante's completely forgotten Small Soldiers was, so he seemed kind of like a crazy homeless person yelling at a wall). Yeah, it's so not that, either. The proof, twelve and a half years later, exists in the slew of WWII themed video games, all very clearly inspired by the film, that have ruled consoles in the past six or so years. I clearly remember Roger Ebert saying that this was the first film that did not make war seem fun, but damned if people aren't having a ton of fun shooting up Nazis on their TVs.

I guess that is why they do not make TJ Hooker shows anymore they have been so over done, who would watch.  In the end I like Hanks but that is about it. 4/10",
205,19 June 2001,Jeremy Bristol,7," Pretty good, but has some definite flaws. Spoilers.","First of all, the framing device for the movie is not just sappy but downright manipulative and quite frankly impossible.  Anytime you frame a flashback like that, you have to stay (mostly) within that characters frame of reference (I can't think of a single example that stays 100% in first person--it's just not possible or practical).  How can Ryan look back in time on someone else's life, while he's somewhere else?  I certainly doubt that Hanks could have told him his life story so quickly.  Spielberg's no idiot, so he knows that this isn't possible, which brings us back to the manipulation factor and the chance to have a ""surprise ending"" in the worst possible sense.  I'd like to think Spielberg was trying to emulate the experience of war (and not knowing who's going to live or who's going to die) by making the old cliches of war movies (that the hero will live) work for him.  Because Spielberg makes us believe that Hanks' character isn't going to die (we think he's the old man), then supposedly we'll be more shocked and have more emotions when he is killed, as if we were experiencing war in real-time. For me this didn't work, because by Bull-S*** alarm started blaring.  It has a high intolerance for lies, and that is pretty much what the framing device does.  It promises one thing, but gives just the opposite.",

Because Spielberg gave us a hell of a view of war!!! This film is not that of history, save for the opening, gore fest battle that contained more than blood and missing limbs like previous war films like Platoon or Glory. I can easily understand that war is hell, which I'm glad Spielberg revelaed to the world for a change.

The first 25 minutes is basically a war battle but if you really think about it, the amount of technical detail you have to put in it is extremely difficult but it is not just the technical detail that makes the scene amazing but you feel what the men are going through and in some cases make you feel like you are actually in the battle. When Wade dies it is very disturbing and hard to watch but it is also very powerful. The plot of the movie is to bring Ryan back home to saftey because 3 of his brothers have died in combat so a group of soldiers are out looking for him. Tom Hanks gives a incredable performance and I found him once again extremely likable. Tom Sizemore is surprisingly really good and so is Giovanni Ribisi. Edward Burns, Adam Goldberg, Berry Pepper, and Jeremy Davies are also good and hold their own. This movie is also good at representing it's soldiers more as ordinary people as oppose to a soldier with no flaws and all he thinks about is serving his country. I am not gonna lie, I cried at the end of this movie when Cpt. Miller dies and that is because I grew attached to his character. The character of John Miller is a teacher and just wants to go home and he is forced into a position he does not want to be in. This movie is about characters in a awful situation and seeing how these characters react to war. Many people point out not giving the other countries a huge amount of characterization is a flaw but I personally viewed it as how we view other countries when we are at war and our perspective on them. Great war movie and this is one of Steven Speilbergs best.",

A film about the war in which Spielberg's father's generation fought to save the world and humanity from the worst of itself, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was unflinching in showing what the men who fought it had to go through.

Even as the Allied forces begin to get a foothold at Omaha, Miller is ordered to take his squad behind enemy lines on a dangerous mission to find and retrieve one man: Private James Ryan (MATT DAMON). The youngest of four brothers, Ryan is the last survivor, the other three having all been killed in action within days of one another.
As the squad pushes deeper into enemy territory, Captain Miller's men find themselves questioning their orders. Why is one man worth risking eight... why is the life of this private worth more than their own?

I tend to find his work somewhat sentimental and too bright and up-beat for my world-view. But here, he delivers. The first thirty minutes or so of this will pretty much tell you what you need to know(and I mean that in the most positive way possible), and few will manage to avoid being pulled in, right from the start in a grip that only really lets go when the credits roll. The production quality is rather close to setting a new standard for highest. The direction is spot-on(there's some beautiful underplaying going on here), and almost all of the emotional material is done exactly right(there was perhaps one bit near the end that just it is not quite there). The pacing is flawless, this never loses your interest(in spite of being close to three hours) nor moves so fast that the audience is lost. The acting is impressive(this thing's got enough acting power to fuel half a dozen of these), even Mark Vincent(even if he'd prefer we called him Vin Diesel) isn't bad(yeah, I know...I could kick myself, and no thanks, Amy). The realism is an accomplishment; the situations, the reactions, the people, everything, almost the entire way through is so close to the real thing you'd swear someone colorized actual footage or something. There is some Hollywood herein, however, but the scales are tipped so far in favour of the authenticity, it's a very, very minor complaint. Cinematography and editing are just amazing... they really bring the scenes to life, and give you a sense of what it must be like to really be there. This has got atmosphere to spare. There is a lot of violence and language. The writing is remarkable, and many details are magnificent. The story isn't the most engaging ever in an anti-war film, but it certainly is good.

The real juice in this movie is first of all a masterful depiction of war as it was: a stupid carnage that took thousands of lives. And the opening sequence proves what I'm talking about: those must be the most haunting 30 minutes of 90's cinema. The movie's also a great study of how Man reacts when everything has cessed to make sense around him. This movie is not an easy experience.

Whilst Spielberg-helmed; starring functional, friendly, relaxed and 'accessable' lead Tom Hanks; released in the summer month of July in America, but getting a more realised winter period release everywhere else and very much arriving as a genre film, Saving Private Ryan is anything but the usual summertime-Spielberg-Hanks led flick, instead turning a entire 'promise' into a thing of pure terror.

S. leadership feels that the Ryan family has endured enough hardship and that their final son should be returned to them in safety. Despite being a ""mercy"" operation, it will put the Americans in much more danger and result in their deaths.",

Three out of four brothers die in the war 1914 while the fourth was a paratrooper deemed lost. Private James Ryan is still alive and Tom Hanks is ordered to bring troops in to extreme danger to bring him home at the request of his mother. The first 25 minutes are horrifyingly realistic as distorted bodies pile up on the Omaha Beach. Director by Steven Spielberg details the reality of surviving an explosion only to discover that your legs are missing. This can easily play double billing with his Schindler's List. Tom Hanks delivers an excellent performance as Captain Miller who leads the mission and is committed to life itself. Matt Damon is well cast as James Ryan who makes a turn for the good of others. Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore and Barry Pepper are also featured among the squadron. The problem is that most of these supporting roles are cardboard types that are always overshadowed by the two leads. Even the scene where an enemy is saved only to later gun one of them down. How likely is it for that same enemy to turn up again with someone set to avenge his act?

289,2 July 2016,videorama-759-859391,10," Horror of war, never more brutal","I had heard about the near 30 minute opening scene, how graphic and scary it was. I had actually dreamed about these scene before watching this film, and there an all too haunting identity to it. This was D day, a.k.a the battle of Normandy, where those small navy boats came onto the shores, and the soldiers were picked off like chickens at a shooting gallery. Many didn't make it ashore, where others that made it ashore, became bloody graphic examples of what this deadly and horrific war was like. This is the most scariest and bloodiest scene I've seen in a war film, where it's near thirty minute duration as it violently depicted what went down, in depth, highly benefited, but made the rest of the other film drop, or seem standard, but I mean that, only in contrast, to the war sequence, which really set the bar high, in one sense. The scene prior to this, in the cemetery, which comes back at the end, makes this story only the more heartbreaking, as we view a sea of graves, just to show you, how shockingly easy the lives of these boys were lost. Now moving on, Captain John Miller (Hanks) assigns a squad to track down one Private Ryan, risking the lives of his squad for this one guy. There are more shockingly violent bits in this too, the atmosphere in the last thirty, resembling that of the ruins in Full Metal Jacket, which unlike that, this one remarkably dodged an R certificate. What surprised me, acting wise, was Vin Diesel as one of Hanks squad, who unfortunately buys it early in the piece, while Hanks wasn't bad, but I have seen better from him, while Barry Pepper again steals their thunder. I like Ted Danson's brief performance too, as another squad captain we bump into on our search for that one party, where his two other brothers didn't make it. I'll be frank, SPR has a very unsettling and frightening aura to it, like I've never felt in any other war film. Another way of saying this, is in the how ""easy to die"" scenario which which I've never felt stronger as in this. Spielberg, again, has pulled off something respectfully and undeniably brilliant, but as someone who's created the most scariest war film, I've ever seen, he should be widely commended, where this film should of walked away with the best film Oscar.",

307,28 June 2009,mdenvee,1, Skip Private Ryan and watch Band of Brothers!!,"After reading some of the 'immaculate' appraisals of this film, I am compelled to explain WHY this film sucks. Sadly, these days there is a declining number of people who can properly and objectively evaluate movies just as there are less and less movies worth evaluation. First, this movie DID NOT win Best Picture. Why? For a WWII epic from Spielberg with this Hollywood cast, unlimited budget, and the notoriety, it speaks volumes about the movie itself that it did not win. The movie had many aspects which merited praise. But far more of it deserved our disdain and disappointment. It is a shame that so few movie viewers can observe the following egregious flaws in a film trumpeted by most here as 'the best war film ever'. First, let me say that the film had only ONE redeeming quality- that of the battle scenes. Very impressive in every way. That's it. That's all. It's all downhill from here. The main failure of this film lies in the fact that it does NOT draw in the audience. There is NO cohesion of characters, zero empathy. I did not care at all about any of the soldiers. Why? Mainly because they were all well-known actors stupidly picked by Spielberg, and there were LOTS of them- just read the cast of actors. This is a huge distraction. I cannot feel the soldiers' pain and grief when they are ALL actors I've seen in movies and TV shows. What a STUPID, boneheaded, amateur mistake by Spielberg. Every scene in the movie has a another actor I know pretty well and whose personalities distract me. Further, all the actors seemed like they did not 'fit' in the 1940s era. They seemed too modern. Too anachronistic. They used too many curse words (which were not used in those days, at least to that degree) and were really 'cheesy'. They all seemed like actors, NOT real soldiers- AND cheesy BAD actors at that. After watching Band of Brothers, one can really identify with the characters, all the characters not just the 'band'. But in Ryan, there is literally ZERO compatibility with the actors. They didn't 'flow' together like fellow soldiers- all seemed to be out of place- hamming up the screen; too much for viewers to take in. Again, the fact that they are ALL well-known actors (and the cameos by Ted Danson and others made it really Hollywoodish and corny). Essentially, I just didn't care remotely about any of the actors- simple. Another annoyance were Hollywood 'touches' like the cheesy prayer the sniper man made every time he aimed for a shot or the annoying Jewish remarks actor/comedian Goldberg made throughout or Diesel's tough-guy mantra, or Tom Hanks' continuous confused 'look'. Spielberg also displayed a disproportionate amount of anti-German efforts. He made typical German soldiers (not the SS) out to be vicious monsters, a lot of which might be true, but the bias was very distracting in the movie. Seeing a freed German soldier return to kill Tom Hanks (the one who freed him) as well as the German who mercilessly and VERY slowly with a knife pierced the only Jewish solider's heart as he begged for mercy and cried...was a very excessive and blatant anti-German effort by Jewish Spielberg- upsetting mostly because it changed the tone of the movie in a very obvious way. Anyway, the entire movie needed more development and the characters (each of them) were severely miscast. It is an obvious Hollywood production which lacks authenticity NOT in the action and special effects, BUT in something far more important in ANY film---plot, script, good acting, and empathy. Private Ryan misses the boat. Strongly recommended is Band of Brothers. Instead of cheesy Tom Hanks acting in it, he directs and does a brilliant job. The series is addictive and priceless...and it makes Private Ryan look like a high school production- thank God the Oscars had the courage to deny it Best Picture. But not enough courage to deny Spielberg Best Director- they wouldn't dare do that. LOL. 'nuff said.",
308,3 February 2000,Bungle-9,10, Great tense stuff,"I love this film to bits. Spielberg, Williams and Kaminski strike again with this great WWII front line drama. All actors were excellent in their roles, and I think Hanks was stiffed at the Oscars. I especially liked the beginning of the D-Day landing scene, with Hanks and co. in the transporter. At that point you can really feel the tension building up, mainly because of the shots of the soldiers faces as they waited to hit the beach. The suspense of the situation really built up when you could hear the bullets clanging against the ramp on the front of the transporter, and it was just sheer terror when the ramp fell and the guys at the front were riddled with bullets. The point is, Spielberg makes the audience feel like they're one of the soldiers on the transporter, and I was no exception. I got the real feeling of not wanting to be one of the soldiers there. The length of the landing scene was quite long, getting you into the feel of the time scale. The blood and gore was necessary to depict how horrible this scene was. The thing is, that's what it was really like.",

I am a great admirer of Steven Spielberg's early works--especially his small, great film ""Duel"". The later works of Spielberg have relied on emotions of audiences, not cinema as a creative medium or as a vehicle to present intelligent perspectives. It is sad that Terrence Mallick's intelligent film ""The Thin Red Line"" on the same war lost out to this melodramatic, ordinary effort from a man who has done better films when he had less success and money.

314,27 May 2008,bobsgrock,10, Far more than just a film...,"Steven Spielberg accomplished something here; something that may rival Schindler's List as his masterpiece and the greatest work he ever did in his extraordinary career. Here, with this film, he shows a side of World War II we all have read about but never saw. While he couldn't completely make it a reality, watching this movie is about as close as any of us will get to experiencing such historical events like D-Day. That being said, this is so much more than just a film that chronicles the story of eight men sent to find one in the German-controlled areas of France. Spielberg here paints a picture of the price and the consequences of war and certainly doesn't glamorize anything. The first half hour of the film is almost exclusively set right in the middle of the action as US forces storm Omaha Beach and try to stay alive amidst the torrential downpour of bullets and bombs. This scene alone earned Spielberg the Best Director Oscar and makes this film one of the great war films of all time. Still, he takes it to another level and gives us characters that we can view as simple everyday men on a mission that they don't believe in trying to find a man they know or care nothing about. To be frank, this is more than a film. It is more than an experience. It is a lesson on war and the complications it brings and the sacrifice it requires. That is what makes this a classic and maybe the best war film ever made. These men gave all they could and something most of us will never have to worry about; they gave their lives and in turn saved so many.",
315,16 November 2016,JamesHitchcock,6, Being a great director is not just about shooting great scenes,"On the same day in July 1916 my great-grandparents received three telegrams from the War Office, informing them that their three eldest sons were all missing in action, presumed dead. (Two were soldiers taking part in the Battle of the Somme, the third a sailor on the convoys to Russia). In fact only one of the boys turned out to have been killed, but my great-grandmother never recovered from the shock. (Her husband seems to have borne the loss of his eldest son more stoically). ",
316,2 March 2011,Andy-296,6, Sentimental film about D-Day has both flaws and merits,"I wasn't too impressed with this film when I saw it more than a decade ago. It's a very corny and sentimental retelling of the landing in Normandy during World War II and subsequent battles in France. The film starts and closes in a veterans cemetery during the present times (that is, around the time it was filmed), and perhaps one of the reasons that the filmmakers made it so sentimental is that around the time it was released, and for obvious biological reasons, many WW2 veterans started dying. I remember that another film dealing with World War II was released at around the same time, Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, which dealt with the war in the Pacific and it was far more gripping and stronger and far less sentimental movie. Private Ryan opens with a now famous scene of the landing in Normandy that is very well done, but the film sort of goes downhill (though not catastrophically) from there on. The character of the German prisoner, for instance, is very crudely written and performed. I have to say, however, that one thing that impressed me about the movie is that it shows American soldiers killing German soldiers as they were surrendering. This undoubtedly happened quite a lot in World War II (and in many wars, I suppose), yet few films show such things. And Spielberg shows this matter of factly, he doesn't give moral judgment on this. For this honesty, I praise the movie. But on balance, I think this movie is only fair.",
317,4 December 1999,jaysonbyrd2k,1, Sentimental,"Overrated and Sentimental. Doesn't have anything new to add to the genre. Re-treads the WWII films of the 1950s and early 1960s. Films like TO HELL AND BACK, PATHS OF GLORY, SANDS OF IWO JIMA, PORKCHOP HILL, THE LONGEST DAY, THE VICTORS, etc. Those films, in my opinion, were fine but I wouldn't want to watch them all over again. That's how I felt sitting in the theater on opening day. Like I was sitting through each and every one of those films. In the overwrought, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Spielberg supplies his patented boyish sense of wonder; something, I believe, is out of place in a genre that is often appropriately somber. What I'm saying is, I just want to see a war drama that appeals to the mind rather than the emotions. A film like the brilliant, introspective, THE THIN RED LINE.",

Yet the rescuing of Sergeant Ryan (Matt Damon) is actually a cynical effort by the High Command to boost morale which puts eight brave men into jeopardy. Spielberg's battle scenes are really something – ten years later I still vividly recall the first 20 minutes on the Normandy beach – the audience is put right in it. Other than that I remember a vivid fire fight in a ruined French village and the final scene 40 years later. I had to be reminded that it was Tom Hanks who led the rescue team (I do recall Vin Diesel in it too), so the acting didn't leave much impression. The actors were overpowered by all the action.",

I also expected to see a true story, which all the trailers claim this movie is. This movie has as much basis in fact as that cheesy soap ""The X-Files"". Spielberg is trying to mess with everyone's head again, and thanks to this movie, there will be a whole generation of people who think ""Saving Private Ryan"" really happened. Luckily they teach students better in school. If you want a hard-hitting, realistic portrayal of war, try Arliss Howard in ""Full Metal Jacket"", Charlie Sheen in ""Platoon"", Adrien Brody in ""The Thin Red Line"", Meg Ryan in ""Courage Under Fire"", or, heck, anything else. This movie had the potential to be one of the greatest war movies of all time. The scenes on the beaches are not only gruesomely real, they're breathtakingly brutal, as well as soul-stopping. If the rest of the movie had one tenth the shock-quality or realism the first few minutes had, this movie would have been one of the best war movies ever made.",

325,13 January 2010,Ziya90,10, No ideology can resist such a piece of cinema triumph,"I visited the forums, read reviews in IMDb, read reviews of critics, talked to the people around me and as I see, people are not excited about the movie like me, it means that they don't see the greatness of the movie? or are there some other reasons? I want to give the example of The Terminator 2. If you have seen the movie, you know that, according to many people, it is the greatest action movie ever made. In IMDb, you cannot see an user easily who gives a low rating or says that it was not a very good movie. Firstly, I want to talk about that, why Saving Private Ryan is not appreciated in its genre, war like The Terminator 2? People are very cold towards this movie, as if it is just an usual but good or pretty good movie. Or they say that Omaha Beach sequence was cool (enough?) but the rest was bad. Now, at this point, I want to say that now I am writing a review on the movie which to me, one of the greatest movies of all time. This is pure cinema, maybe not a work of art, but a truly cinematic experience. Direction, the cinematography, editing, art direction, sound, sound editing and visual effects (briefly mise-en-scene) are great, the shots are great. You know, if a war movie includes action, people say that disliked it, because it was not an anti war movie and also it shows war artistic, but what if this is the style of the director? The Thin Red Line was also very artistic, but is this really a flaw? Returning to the content or the messages of the film, people say propaganda, militarist, one sided etc. As a person who got sick of hearing historically inaccurate or this movie is propaganda, I don't care about ideology while thinking about this movie. As for one sided criticism, always the same, it shows the enemy side as evil. Does somebody have to make two movies like Clint Eastwood if he makes a war movie? Well, if you ask me, No. By the way, the scene which the German soldier sings an American march is criticized, so people say Spielberg humiliates Germans. If you want to 'read' it like that, do it, but to me it was an unforgettable and tragicomic scene. The best (or the most horrible?) D-Day interpretation is here. At this point, as said before, a lot of people think that just Omaha Beach sequence was just cool. I think it is more than that. Also the structure of the movie is very different than many mainstream movies which is another success. Lastly, in the middle of the movie, there is a sequence, it rains and later they find a little girl, that sequence should be taught in cinema history lessons especially for the people who are planning to be a director.",

I think that this is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Steven Spielburg remains to be the sappiest director of all time. There was absolutely no point in showing the D-day invasion at the beginning of this film. There was no point to a lot of things in this film. Sure this film was realistic, but I could care less about realism as long as the rest makes sense. There were scenes in this movie that came out of nowhere for no reason. Besides a bunch of nonsense scenes, this movie has a plot that drove me insane. The U.S. government risks the lives of 8 men to save one so that his mother won't be too depressed. The worst part of the entire film however was the showing of Private Ryan as an old man in the cemetery.

340,31 October 2003,jasonz42,9, The most realistic view of war yet,"Firstly, this film is not 'entertaining' in the way war films like Pearl Harbour tried to be. This film attempts to re-create war as realistically as possible, and, although I've never been in one myself, from what I hear it is the best representation yet. By definition this means you cannot 'enjoy' it like you would most films. The opening scene at the beach during D-day was harrowing rather than enjoyable to watch. You don't find yourself on the edge of your seat as bullets fly, you find yourself cringing and wondering why on Earth people get driven to this. After this scene the film becomes less miserable and slightly more watchable as an entertainment mechanism, but it never loses its realistic touch. Hanks delivers a memorable if not slightly flawed performance, whilst the script is interesting to listen to. In general, this is the first film I have come across that truly played on my emotions and affected me, which is what it's meant to do. It is a fantastic achievement in the sense that it finally begins to show people just how real the horrors of war are. If you're looking for a nice night in with an action film, don't watch this. If you want to see closer to the truth, and appreciate truly great filmwork, watch it.",
341,15 May 2007,drystyx,7, throwback to old war movies,"This is a throwback to old war movies, make no mistake. We have an identifiable group of men (eight of them), who go on a mission. This one is to risk their lives to save one man. Its based upon the story of the Sullivans, a group of brothers who all died, and the Department of Defense decided it was time to act so that not all of a family would perish in war. The Sullivans served together on the same ship (The Indianaplois), and perished. Of course if they had lived, they probably would have just moved to the East coast, had their own ship, go hunting for a giant shark, and made fun of college kids, then get eaten by a shark any way. So these eight soldiers look for Private Ryan, the last of his family, and are to make him return home. Along the way, they suffer casualties. There isn't a lot of new material here. A lot has been made of the gore, but even the old films had gore to equal or outdo this. Old World War Two films didn't hesitate to have men lose their legs when tanks would run over and amputate them, or to be horribly disfigured. So there is nothing new. The action comes in bits and pieces until a big fight in the end. Some of it looks a little too contrived, to be honest, as though the director was aiming at some conclusion with all the little conclusions coming first. True to old time movies, minor characters die first, and also true to old time movies, men from New York and cigarette smokers get a free pass and cannot be killed, so you know some who will survive. Just a little too trite and Hollywood to be recommended, but not a bad movie.",

The whole concept of a soldier getting released from war just because his brothers died is plain stupid emotional tearjerker, it'a also extremely unfair to other soldiers whose brothers and sisters also died just in smaller amount than Ryan's.

The movie stars Tom Hanks as Captain John Miller who unfortunately did not win an Oscar for this movie when he really should have won, director Steven Spielberg has crafted his best movie since his first Oscar winning turn since his 1993 holocaust movie Schindler's List. Also in the movie there were a lot of other good performances from Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, and Vin Diesel. This movie goes on a par with war film classics such as Black Hawk Down, Patton, The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Sands of Iwo Jima, Flags of Our Fathers, The Devil's Brigade, and 633 Squadron.

The scene with Mrs. Ryan left the audience with the devastating reality of men in combat war and an inkling of hope for the missions that Captain aMillers squad was about to complete. The movie does a really good job of making the audience emotionally connected to the characters, making surviving and completing the mission very imperative. This makes each death that the audience encounters extremely tough. The last battle scene at Remmel was the most anxiety inducing of them all. The death of Captain Miller was especially hard to deal with. The ending scene with Private Ryan as an old man with his family visiting the grave of the late Captain Miller and thanking him was both sad and heartwarming.

354,27 March 2010,paul2001sw-1,7, Competent but conventional,"There's a fairly standard narrative in war films today: that wars are hell, but that the men who fight them deserve our respect, and it's perhaps unsurprising that Stephen Spielberg's film about the Normandy landings essentially repeats the message. The movie's structure: an initial battle, an interlude, and then a concluding fight, is also typical; and background music, slow motion scenes and a present day top-and-tail to the story are added in to make sure that the audience knows what to think. In spite of this, it's not a bad film, fully depicting the chaotic horror of war and resisting the temptation to easily close at least some of its subplots; although on other occasions, it's too clear how a given tale is going to end. A bigger problem for me, however, was the absence of a character I could really care about: Tom Hanks's hero is just too heroic for me to care about, not in a silly way but a character for us to admire rather than for us to feel empathy for. Although a lengthy movie, it didn't feel like one; but in the end, I didn't feel moved by its respectful conclusion.",

Redefines the war movie along with a most compelling human drama","'Saving Private Ryan' is an epic war film that was released in 1998 and directed by Steven Spielberg. This film gained much notoriety for its intense, immersive visual style and its initial sequence that depicted a portion of the D-Day invasion of Normandy. That scene in specific, but really the entirety of the film is filled with some of the most intense war sequences ever filmed. The film stars a true ensemble cast featuring actors such as Vin Diesel, Edward Burns, Matt Damon and Tom Sizemore with Tom Hanks filling the role of primary lead as Captain John H. Miller. It also features famous actors in bit parts such as Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson and Nathan Fillion among others. The film is one of the most famous and important of the 1990's and serves as an interesting bookend to Spielberg's other 90's masterpiece, 'Schindler's List'. The film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards winning 5 of them, but in one of the most shocking upsets in Oscar history it lost Best Picture to 'Shakespeare in Love'. This war film experience must have given Tom Hanks the WWII bug as he and Spielberg would go on to executive produce HBO's 'Band of Brothers' mini-series' which essentially is a long form of 'Saving Private Ryan' and as far as I am concerned is about the best filmed entertainment I have ever seen.",

But people can't handle that the man who made E.T. and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK would make a serious film about the horrors of war.  For those who say it's powerful battle scenes at the beginning and end and nothing but cliches in between, I say hogwash!  Is it a cliche when Tom Hanks' character is screaming at one of his soldiers not to save a child?

With an unforgettable story, the plot is quite moving even just thinking about it. The movie was also expertly shot and acted. Every action scene is realistic as it is bloody. After soldiers are killed off, it makes the soldiers question if the mission is worth it and it often creates conflict with them.

373,29 May 2011,nickmesafilms,10, Saving Private Ryan (1998) - Spielberg in Action!,"Steven Spielberg's biggest hit to date is the epic war film, ""Saving Private Ryan"". The film follows around eight men in World War II, saving one soldier, whose three brothers were killed, and is the only brother alive. The film has powerful scenes of war and drama that teaches us the horror and drama of the war. Only Steven Spielberg, and his brilliant cast including Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, & Matt Damon, can bring an amazing motion picture that takes a deep step closer and closer until the film has its reaching point. Tom Hanks delivers one of his best performances of his whole career, Edward Burns was pretty impressive for his role, and Matt Damon had the shortest scenes in the whole movie, but those were good scenes. Steven Spielberg always delivers fine directing in all of his movie, but this one takes the cake. Everything about this movie, from the incredible cinematography, the intense film editing, to the explosive sound, ""Saving Private Ryan"" was one heck of a thrill. Though the war scenes were long and graphic, that does not stop the film's power. This film happens to be one of Spielberg's best movies yet. Also, the movie felt like a moving bio-diary of the many soldiers losing their lives in World War II. The movie felt personal, moving, emotional, and there are so many things to say about this movie, that I don't have time to say it all. This movie will always be a piece of history to me. Steven Spielberg really knows how to make a dramatic, well-acted war movie with a heart. ""Saving Private Ryan"", in my review, ""Emotionally powerful, and completely excellent.""",

Schindler's List was perhaps the worst example of this trend... followed closely by Saving Private Ryan. Both films were undoubtedly critical and commercial successes. But somewhere, something called a soul may be MIA amidst all the hoopla.

378,19 August 1999,macpherr,10," I felt that in a sense, that we are all Private Ryan because those soldiers fought for our freedom!","Normally I do not like war movies, but I watched Saving Private Ryan and loved it! It deserves to be among  the top 250 movies. The story is loosely based on a true story of The Sullivan Brothers. There were five brothers that were all put aboard a ship, the ship sunk and they all died in the same day. Imagine how devastating that must have been to that family. Because of the Sullivan Brothers there has been a law passed that siblings cannot serve on the same vessel. 	My father -in-law was a pilot and the only son during the Korean war.  He was a volunteer! His plane crashed on U.S. soil. My husband is the soul survivor and he was then seven months old. My mother-in -law heard the news on the radio. Imagine how devastating that must have been. My husband makes miniature model airplanes.  We have quite a collection of those cute little planes. Every airplane is well researched as my husband goes to National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.  He is very interested in the Pacific Theater - a war buff!  He also corresponds with several veterans. It is really adorable. He loves war movies.  I tend to fall asleep watching them, unfortunately,  but I try to stay awake and understand. We have a good collection of famous war movies, educational videos etc. I purchased Saving Private Ryan along with a very romantic movie, because I thought: I am sure that I will doze off! But no! I watched the entire thing and loved it! 	Let me tell you why I loved it: (1) There is no unnecessary use of curse words. They are used properly there are no exaggerations! I watched  ""Full Metal Jacket,""  I know that those guys curse but every word in that movie is ""F word!"" I hated it. (2) Then the painted faces. They scare me to death! I know it is a form of camouflage but I still get scared. That is what scared me the most in ""Apocalypse Now""  and ""Platoon."" (3) I understood the story in this movie and it is moving. It is nice story telling. Going back in time. Private Ryan being such a nice person makes the movie even better!  I liked two war movies so far,  this one and ""A Midnight Clear."" I must understand the point. Just plain violence does not cut it! People say but that is how war is. Well, I want to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.  I can only take so much. I did not have to go to war. It is just a movie. I do not want to be traumatized all at once in one movie!  (4) I don't like the over emphasis on the use of drugs in movies like ""Platoon""either. There is nothing like that in Saving Private Ryan. That is why I love it! 	My favorite scene: at the end of the movie cemetery, the camera pans and there are all those white crosses:  I felt that we are all Private Ryan because those soldiers fought for our freedom. Most of us enjoy such freedom undeservingly. But they died for us all.  My favorite quotes: "" All four were in the same company, but after we split them  after the Sullivan brothers died on the Juno."" Ryan: "" Tell her that when you found me, I was here and I was with the only brothers that I have left"".",

383,20 April 2023,tjmcdonough,10, My favorite war film (As long as it actually shows the battlefield itself),"While I can't say it's better than Schindler's List, this is still a phenomenal film and is one of Steven's best films. This is probably the most realistic portrayal of war I've ever seen in a movie despite never being in the military with me being 14 years old, therefore me never being on the battleground. Yes it still provides the ""war is bad"" message but almost every time I've seen it portrayed extremely well in movies like The Thin Red Line, 1917 and All Quiet on the Western Front (the 2022 film). Tom Hanks gives a fantastic performance as John Miller and portrays the Captain who doesn't even care who the private is and knows that he'll go back home. But it's more heartbreaking when you see his character is shot at the end of the film. The cinematography, editing and sound design are probably the best I've seen and heard from any movie. So much of the shots and edits are absolutely phenomenal because of how it's more done like a smaller camera but still maintains the epic scale the movie earns. The edits also still show what is still going on throughout the movie and it's done in an intense way that still makes it horrifying to see. The sound design of the gunshots and the tanks are also phenomenal to listen to. But it's not a shock since it's the great Gary Rydstrom doing the sound design for the film. Steven's direction also provides a realistic setting that the movie earns. The first 20 minutes I'm basically speechless. Phenomenal cinematography, editing, makeup and the sound design are all amazing. The gore and the horrors of war are also portrayed extremely well especially when you see the soldiers crying for their mothers which is heartbreaking when you see them die on that bloody beach on that fateful day. This is my favorite war film as long as it shows the battles themselves simply because of the respectful portrayal, the writing, Steven's direction, the music, the makeup, the cinematography, the editing, the sound design, Tom's performance which all come together to create one of the greatest films of all time. And as you can see, I completely understand why.",
384,19 May 2009,tburke85,10, Saving Prive Ryan One Of The Best War Movies Ever Made,"Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made period. From the intense harrowing opening battle sequence to it's explosive yet touching climax, Saving Private Ryan grabs hold of you and never lets go. Acclaimed director Steven Spielberg brings this movie to the big screen and he continues to prove that he's one of the best filmmakers in Hollywood today. With a great cast including Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Barry Pepper, and Vin Disiel a relatively unknown at the time (in a small role) all turn in terrific performances. For those of you who haven't seen it yet I won't say anything else about the film. It's one of those movies you should see without knowing too much about it because that only enhances the experience. The battle sequences are jaw dropping, hard to watch at times, and realistic giving audiences a look at what these courageous men went through back then. The running time of 170 minutes did make the movie feel a little slow at times but thats a minor flaw and the good more than outweighs the bad. If you're a fan of Spielberg, the cast, or war movies than you'll love Saving Private Ryan. It's one of those films that can be missed.",
385,16 July 2017,Horst_In_Translation,4, I cannot see the appeal at all (probably due to personal bias),"""Saving Private Ryan"" is an American movie from 1998, so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year. The director is Steven Spielberg and this one is from the years that many probably consider his very best years in filmmaking. It came out half a decade roughly after his probably career-defining Schindler's List. But while I really love the latter, this one here did not make a lasting impression on me at all. I already stated in the title of my review that this may be due to personal bias as war movies are just not exactly my preferred choice. Knowing how it is considered such a classic, however, I thought why not give it a go nonetheless. But I had more than just a few problems with it. Let me mention some. The very long introduction of Hanks' character early on could have been left out completely if you ask me and the movie could have started with the scene where we find out that Mother Ryan lost all her sons during the very same day, which is admittedly not very realistic, even during the days of World War II. And still, it was one of the better scenes nonetheless I believe, probably also because of my aforementioned bias and I was grateful for every distraction that offered more than gun shootings, soldiers' uniforms and people crawling through the mud. I am also not a fan of ""Band of Brothers"", another Spielberg/Hanks collaboration. Hanks was probably the biggest film star on the planet at that time after having won two Oscars recently, so yeah given Spielberg was maybe also at the peak of his popularity, this certainly could have become something tremendous. And I like Hanks. A lot actually, which makes me even more sad this one here did not turn out to my liking at all.",

This movie set a new standard for the film industry when it comes to recreating combat scenerios. The D-Day scene is the most brutal, realistic depiction of war ever produced. When you go to a movie (war movie or any movie) the filmmakers try to give you the sense of watching that scene play out in real time in front of your eyes, In this one though, Spielberg grabs you by the shirt, pulls you in, and makes you be a witness to the scene as it plays out.",
389,13 January 2007,general-melchett,10, A brilliant war film - the best ever!,"Bullets slash through the air. Everything explodes around you. Your men are getting shelled to death everywhere you look. Blood goes in your face. You lose your sanity in war. You don't know what to do, or where to go. This is SPR's depiction of Omaha Beach on D-Day 1944, and an absolutely brilliant one at that. Not since SPR has any filmmaker with any budget churned out an action scene as horrifyingly real as this film's brutal depiction of the Normandy landings. Even if for nothing else other than the first half-hour, you should still watch this film. From the moment you see nervous recruits chuck up inside the Higgins boats, you can tell you are in for a stunning action scene. Though after that the film won't ever be as intense or shocking in its action, it is still something truly special. The desaturated colours, abundance of shouting, swearing and explosions tell you one thing - this is war. Though Black Hawk Down is easily as intense as this, it just doesn't have the gritty feel of SPR and you can't exactly care about the characters. But on this, you can - they're all real people leading real lives back home - no horrible sacrifices or acts of heroism - just ordinary guys like us, thrust into a world that they didn't like and in which they knew death awaited them at any corner. I doubt anybody will ever make a war movie that will recapture SPR's dizzy heights. Flags of our Fathers didn't do the job and Letters From Iwo Jima, though it is looking promising, just isn't intended to be a box-office smash. Though SPR is full of war-movie clichés, it is far better than most movies and besides, it is hard to like a movie without an emotional or sentimental side - every film needs a heart. And the war memorial scenes at the beginning and end of the film show us what SPR wanted to be all along - a respectful homage to the soldiers of WWII. To be honest, with all the intense and bloody action scenes in this film putting us in the thick of battle, it is good to have a bit of emotional contemplation once in a while. War is brutal and unforgiving, but war is also saddening and tear-jerking - Saving Private Ryan uses both those sides to its advantage. Forget major plot twists or superbly intelligent and brilliant scripts, clever plots that lose you and amazing hero characters - realism is the place to be in war cinema. That may explain why Saving Private Ryan did so well for itself. 10/10",

One can hardly believe that it is a movie because the way they have pictured the film is more like a documentary. The bloodshed at the beginning of the film and the cemetery yard with all the white crosses takes you up to the heaven. It is too rare that one watches this movie and doesn't get shocked.

409,2 July 2000,abaris,4, Weak,"Blood, dirt, dying soldiers and others so scared, that they are unable to move. A dirty little war is going on, and a great film to condemn war  well for the first half of the movie. But what happens then? Ryan turns out to be Mr. All American Hero. He doesn't waste a thought for his three fallen brothers, he doesn't give a damn about his grieve-stricken mother (she will understand  will she?), but insists on defending that little bridge After Schindler's list and Amistad, Ryan's not Spielberg's best film. In fact, the second half makes private Ryan to any warfilm, the Pentagon or any other war-ministry in the world would be proud of. Just a little war-adventure under the checkered flag. What a pitty",
410,26 March 2002,Kakueke,8," Vivid, evocative","I was told it was worth it to see this movie for the opening battle scenes alone, and that turned out to be an accurate statement. In no other war movie is there anything like the realism and aura in picturing soldiers being peppered, and sometimes hit, by machine gun fire.  From pillboxes on D-Day, no less, with the tensions of an amphibious landing.  The scenes of the wounded throughout this film are also something else, serving as the archetype and forerunner of ""Black Hawk Down.""  Some points in the battle scenes, beginning and later, might be described as real and surreal at the same time, a la Kubrick.",
411,6 May 2015,lucasversantvoort,7, Way too formulaic in its depiction of the horrors of war,"Throughout film history, there's been a constant fascination with war. As new documentaries on the two great World Wars appear every year, so do films on similar events. From All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) to the recently released Fury (2014), Hollywood's interest in depicting war shows no signs of slowing down. Spielberg's 1998 epic Saving Private Ryan fits in a long line of war epics attempting to depict the horrors of war in a realistic manner. SPR does this exceptionally wellfor the duration of roughly 20 minutes.",
412,6 December 2018,carolynvargas,9, The master creates magic- One of the greatest WW2 films ever.,"Most World War II movies fall into one of two categories: heroic tales of glory and valor or biopics but Saving Private Ryan is neither. Instead, it's a condemnation of war wrapped in a tale of human courage and sacrifice. There's nothing especially complex about the structure of Saving Private Ryan. The film, which runs nearly three hours, is bookended by two major battle scenes. In between, smaller fights alternate with quiet, character-building moments that flesh out the soldiers, allowing them to escape the threat of stereotyping. Spielberg, along with writer Robert Rodat and the actors, ensures that everyone in the movie is developed into a multi-dimensional individual for whom we can grieve if and when they die. The action sequences are some of the best ever captured in any genre and the opening Omaha landing sequence which runs almost half an hour is a tour de force of filmmaking. This film is simply unmissable.",
413,13 November 2005,bcolquho,10," ""War, Gentlemen, is hell!""","The above, ^, is a quote by the famous Union general William T. Sherman. Saving Private Ryan shows the hell, fog, and confusion of war. What else can I say? How about Based on a true story? It was. In the brief scene with General Marshall, where he reads a letter to a Mrs. Nieland in Boston, one signed by Abraham Lincoln, it's not General Marshall, played by Dale Dye, a former Marine captain, who's reading it. It's John de Lancie, Star Trek's Q, who's the uncredited letter reader. It opens with an older Ryan and his family at the American cemetery in Normandy. He's at the grave of Captain John H. Miller, the man who saved his life, in Normandy in 1944. So what's the message of Saving Private Ryan? Since I opened this review with a quote from General Sherman, why don't I close it with one from the Book of John? ""Greater love hath no man than this: That he lay down his life for his friends."" Maybe I should paraphrase the epitaph on an unknown Marine who died on Guadalcanal. ""When he gets to heaven, to St. Peter he will tell: 'Another soldier reporting, sir. I've served my time in hell.""",

The scene at the Omaha beach is just too brutal and disturbing. It doesn't fail to make us realize how bad actually is war and what the soldiers have been through on the battlefield to end it.
Tom hanks is absolutely breathtaking and his badass closing scene is legendary. Matt Damon has a minor role but he's good too.

On top of that, the film quality is pristine and the high-speed equipment used to shoot the movie is nothing short of groundbreaking in the war genre.

418,21 May 2020,d-48544,9, Save One People with Lives of EightPeople,"Saving Private Ryan, a film related to World War ll, directed by Spielberg, received critical acclaim upon screening. The upsurge of Saving Private Ryan is not only because it is realistic visual impact,what is more important, this film led to anargument about lives.
During World War ll, the U.S. and U.K.army landed in Normandy on June 6,1944. To insure the victory, Private JamesRyan (Matt Damon), and his troops -101st Airborne Division, are airdropped behind the German front -lines. Unfortunately, all his three brothers werekilled in action at the same time. In order to prevent the unfortunate mother fromlosing all her four sons, the U.S. commanddecided to send a special squad to lookfor James Ryan and take him back safely.
There is a wonderful line in the film: To the world, you are a soldier; to your mother,you are the whole world. If you insist that this task is not worth, from now on, live carefully, become a good person, be kind to others, and you would learn more from this film.",

Sacrifice the whole ""rescue"" unit for sake of one's paratrooper's life? Is a search for one man (not rescue exactly) worth risking lives of a whole squad? Furthermore, how can someone expect of a small unit, which consists of bunch of infantrymen, to find one man in such a vast area? There was a big mess after attack of allied paras. They were spread all over the huge invasion area with heavy loses. Someone wrote here the idea to call 101st on radio to pull Ryan back. Realistically that would have been the best thing to do.",

I mean you show a seen at Omaha beach on Jun 6,1944 and the moment the ramps go down already the first three or four rows of solider literally get blown to bits. After that you see more solider get shot, killed, and wounded until some solider finally get up to the bunkers and take out the Nazis's, and to top all that off you see the beach after it covered with dead bodies and big puddles of blood. then you hear that 8 men have to save 1 man who lost all three of his brothers and after more violence you see that of the 8 men sent out only 2 are still alive. I can't think of any reason why you couldn't be moved by this film. This is a must see film for anyone interested in war films.",

He affirmed that in a interview that he considers the WWII one of the most significant events of the last hundred years, and always sought to portray it somehow. It took the screenwriter Robert Rodat and Tom Hanks to show to Spielberg a story almost like ""Apocalypse Now"", inspired by an event of the civil war, taking place during the Second World War, to the master retract the war in the best way (possibly) ever made.",
431,10 December 2005,wmarkley,6, Very Overrated,"Yes, ""Saving Private Ryan"" has very graphic action scenes which are more realistic than the average war movie, but there are other aspects in which it fails in being authentic: the attitudes, behaviors and values of the people in the time period which the movie depicts. In particular, some of the major and minor characters of ""S.P.R."" exhibit very self-absorbed characteristics which would have been very uncommon among regular troops during World War II. Sure, people have some of the same feelings and other characteristics throughout history, and soldiers frequently grumble and are cynical, but the people shown in this movie tend to reflect much more what 1990's guys were like rather than 1940's men. For a war movie which does a better job of showing 1940's troops, try ""Battleground.""",

They are the most graphic and horrific depiction one could imagine being translated onto screen. And, as a Brit who has also been to the beaches in question, I felt extremely humbled and thankful for the incredible sacrifices made. But this is a film, not a vote on the actual perfomance of the heoric men who fought to rid Europe of evil. And I'm afraid the second half of the film gets progressively worse until we are left with a silly tale about Tom Hanks saving the world. This is a real shame.

For me, the film is stylistically schizophrenic, he should have used the documentary-style all the way through. Now he falls between two chairs, making the movie feel disjointed and unbalanced. What irritates me is that he could and should have been more consistent in tone, he of all directors certainly could afford more experimentation. Now it has moments of genius, and moments of cheesy standard Spielberg-sentimentality, and a paradoxical pro-war message: war makes you grow as a person. Very good performances (but a questionable Matt Damon) and striking photography and sound, but unfortunately not as good as it should have been.",

The opening and bridge scene is phenomenal and is up there with some of the best scenes in cinemas history overall definitely worth a try,
