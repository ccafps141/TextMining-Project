0,17 June 2003,simon_booth,10, Unmatched accomplishment,"Sometimes reading the user comments on IMDB fills me with despair for the species.  For anybody to dismiss 2001: A Space Odyssey as ""boring"" they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making.  Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience.",/
1,14 April 2018,Wesley-Wang,10, Legendary,"A stand-alone monument in cinema history, Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is an undeniable masterpiece. 2001 not only shattered science fiction genre conventions, but gave cinema a whole new meaning. From the grandiosity of its futuristic idea to its ambitious execution, 2001 isn't concerned with entertaining us- but rather to inspire us with awe. I've never seen a person say, ""2001: A Space Odyssey? I don't think I've seen it... oh wait, the one with like, the spaceships and stuff?"", while most movies today are forgotten once the credits roll. What viewers must understand is that 2001 not the type of movie where you ""get it"" or not, nor is it designed to thrill us with flashy special effects- but as Kubrick said, is ""...intended to be an intensely subjective experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of consciousness."" In it of itself, exploring the philosophical and scientific arenas of mankind while serving as a groundbreaking achievement both on a conceptual and technical level is a hell of an accomplishment, but to transcend the audience to a whole new dimension all in one- that's sheer genius at its highest form.",r

Those who love it, those who hate it, those who enjoyed it, all of them. And the reason is simple: everything they say makes sense to me. I watched the movie for the first time about 10 years ago, and watched it again last night. It still doesn't make perfect sense to me. I mean, the story is absent, the characters don't really get through you, and the ending...who gets that ending?? #SPOILERS# BELOW",e

Actually, I have a degree in media studies and a great interest in science, science fiction and anything thought-provoking (the technical term is ""need for cognition""). But I am just baffled by this film and why it is so esteemed. It is simply slow, empty and lifeless. When absolutely nothing is happening on screen, am I supposed to feel or think something profound? Even when my professor explicitly explained to me why this film is so great, I still cannot convince myself that it is so.",v

7,7 March 1999,Don-102,10, Tribute to one of the top 5 filmmakers of our time...,"I write this review just after hearing of Stanley Kubrick's death. It's a great loss, and I write about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel it is the consummate Kubrick film, the one he will be most remembered for. It is a picture like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. It was probably America's first 'art' film and has inspired the likes of George Lucas and countless other writers and directors.",/
8,3 January 2005,sol-,10, My brief review of the film,"A whimsical, often spectacular view of a future in which advances in technology dominate the world. It is well shot and although slow-moving it is intense and enjoyable throughout. The featuring of classical music to establish atmosphere works brilliantly; it provides a feeling of awe, mystery and intrigue  the same aura that Walt Disney worked in creating 'Fantasia'. The special effects, both sound and visual, are still spellbinding by the standards of today's technology. Aside from the technical pluses of the film, it stands strong as it is one of not many films out there that has something important to say about humankind, and where the human race is heading in terms of our increasing reliance on machines and our unquenchable thirst to discover. Despite an ending that is hard to understand, it is even harder to overlook this film a true cinema classic.",r

On the moon, another block has been discovered, the apes now have the means to open wings and smother, it's to Jupiter they go, what they'll find nobody knows, but it doesn't seem to fill primates with dread. To protect they have a powerful A. I., it misses nothing, and nothing passes by, everything will not be fine, if you rely on an airline, as it watches with satanic, evil eye.

Now aged 47, and fully prepared (or so I thought) for a more cerebrally challenging experience than George Lucas's space opera, I've finally caught up with Kubrick's celebrated sci-fi 'masterpiece'.

12,28 February 2005,Smells_Like_Cheese,1, 2001: A Cure for Insomnia,"I'm sorry, good music and cool special effects do not make a good movie! What the heck? I mean, I saw this movie when I was a kid, and I didn't like it. Now, I have a growing appreciation for movies, and I wanted to write a comment from a more grown up point of view. I had 2 hours to spare and I watched this movie, I swear I nearly went insane. I normally put on the subtitles, in case I miss something or misunderstand the dialoug, 89% of the movie is silent! Apes?! I could just go to the zoo and say I saw this movie! I could watch ""Star Wars"" and say I saw this movie! It's the same friggin' thing. I'm not trying to be so harsh on this film, but how can anyone find this entertaining?! How?! Unless you are 150 years old, that is the only way I could understand. Geez, people. This movie is so out dated and needs to be thrown away, especially from the top 250! Why are so many bad movies on top 250?! I'm getting sick of these over hyped movies! 1/10",3
13,3 June 1999,mmt02,10, Greatest Movie of All Time,"Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give four good reasons why 2001 is  the greatest cinema experience of all time:  1) It is a visual Odyssey that could only be told on the big screen.  The special effects that won Kubrick his only Oscar are the most  stunning effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow  Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate)  depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space  scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds  to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with HAL).  The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is  a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original  release, it was a favorite ""trip"" movie. I can think of no other movie  that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry  Phantom Menace fans!)  2) Kubrick's directing style is terrific. As in all his films, Kubrick  likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his  characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such  as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces  are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M  and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the  audience a psychological view-point. Even he uses extreme close-ups of  HAL's glowing red ""eye"" to show the coldness and determination of the  computerizd villain. I could go on, but in summation Kubrick is at the  hieght of his style.  3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I  whole-heartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion of HAL 9000.  Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and  the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and  his crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter, with nowhere to  escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL 9000  and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still, although  having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a  particular scene.  4) The controversial  ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film. Instead of  trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of  2001's meaning in general is, I'd like to discuss the fact that the  ending serves to leave the movie open-ended. Kubrick has stated that he  inteded to make 2001 open for discussion. He left its meaning in the  hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick  allowed his movie to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful  discussion on man's past, present, and future. The beauty of 2001 is  that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely  plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an  entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the great  Citizen Kane, leaves itself open to discussion like 2001. It is truly  meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the  mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace, rent a  widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.",2
14,23 December 2007,Chaves7777,10," Strange, beautiful and excellently made for an open and patient mind","Undoubtelly, one of the best photographed movies of all time is Kubrick's masterpiece ""2001: A Space Oddisey"", but is maybe one of that masterpieces that much can see over and over again, and others not even finished in spite that know how much people and critic loves this movie.",6
15,19 October 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10, 2001: A Mesmerising Odyssey,"To me, this is not only Kubrick's best film but also a milestone of the genre. It is quite long at around two and a quarter hours, and it is slow, that I agree with. But it is never boring, well not to me it isn't. Besides, and this is up to interpretation, but I think the slow pacing is deliberate, it adds to the haunting and eerie quality 2001 has and also to assimilate every shot which speak volumes, and also 2001's greatest strength is actually in the details.",8

What's funny is ""2001"" isn't even my favourite movie. But I believe it tells the story of humankind better than anything else I've ever seen on the big screen. Essentially it asks the age old question ""what is the meaning of life?"", and for my money, it provides a very satisfying answer.",/
18,21 June 2014,utgard14,10, Kubrick's Masterpiece,"What can I really say about one of the greatest films of all time that hasn't been said already? The first time I saw it as a teenager I was left amazed at what I had seen but at the same time confused as to what it all meant. This was the first movie I saw that didn't spell everything out for me. It took time for me to learn to enjoy that. It's a beautiful film. I've heard it described as visual poetry and I think that is as accurate a way of putting it as anything else. The visuals are stunning. The special effects, sets, costumes are all first-rate. I recently watched it with my girlfriend who had never seen it and has tastes that are strictly mainstream. She was in awe of the look of the film, particularly given its age. Not enough good things can be said about Kubrick's use of classical music in this, as well. It's a masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it's received. Obviously a film that every serious film fan has to see. It might not be to everybody's tastes but it's an experience unlike any other and, in my opinion, worth repeated viewings. For those of you interested, there's obviously the Arthur C. Clarke books that are worth reading but I'm also going to recommend you check out the Jack Kirby 2001 comics. They're trippy and lots of fun!",?
19,13 June 2020,alexcole10,10, Leaves the Viewer Thinking for Weeks on End,2001: A Space Odyssey is my favourite film of all time for simply one reason: the ending. Kubrick's ambiguous finish to this suspenseful trip will leave you debating and theorising its purpose for a long time.,r

Don't get me wrong, this is one of the most important movies of all time. But is it good? No. It's not good.

22,16 November 2001,Cain47,10, Nietzsche and 2001,"I'm always surprised, given that the famous title track of 2001 is called ""Also sprach Zarathustra"", that nobody (nobody I've read, anyway) has noted the parallels between the movie and Nietzsche's famous work, ""Also sprach Zarathustra"". The idea of man's rebirth into a star child; an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being, is an explicit part of N.'s ""Zarathustra""; there is a prominent passage called ""On how a camel becomes a lion, and a lion becomes a child"", in which N. describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child, transcending both the ascetic, altruistic side of man (the camel; always asking to bear more weight) and the rapacious, brutish, will-to-power side of man (the lion). The fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence. And also, Zarathustra said that ""man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman."" The structure of the movie fits that description: a brief history of man as beast, until we become truly man by mastering weapons and acquiring reason, then a long sequence about man (the rope, as it were), and then a brief glimpse of the overman. The inscrutability of how these transformations occurred, and the suggestion that an external force caused them, is also Nietzschean; in ""Zarathustra"", he makes it pretty clear that he doesn't have a clue how people are going to be able to enact these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider (Zarathustra) to show us how to ""go under"". Bowman's psychedelic sequence at the near-end could be seen as Kubrick's best 1960's-style attempt at depicting the mystical ""going under"".",_
23,13 November 2007,MCL1150,1," Great to Look at, but...","""2001: A Space odyssey"" is one of the great cinematic visual experiences ever put on film. And flying across the United States from coast to coast while staring out the window is also a great visual experience. Yep, you're certainly glad that you weren't asleep the whole trip, but there's no way to stay awake the whole time either. Such is 2001. Looks Fantastic, but at some point you're just staring out that window wondering ""For God's sake! When will we FINALLY touch back down and get on with it? Some fans see Stanley Kubrick as God. I see their point. God created this incredible planet and there's so much surrounding heavenly beauty to behold, just like Kubrick stuffs into 2001. That said, you just reach a breaking point at which you're like ""OK, nice planets! Nice starry heavens!! Nice lens flare!!! Assuming though that I'll live at least one more day, I'll try and see the rest of it tomorrow 'cause I'm like really freaking' bored silly right now! Yep, tomorrow. I'll admire it . . . tomorrow . . . or the day after that, but for now it's just putting me to sleep. And guess what? My own dreams never leave me bored!

28,26 September 2005,sveknu,1, One word: AVOID!,"Warning! Do not see this movie unless you're planning to waste more than two hours of your life. This has (without doubt) to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. If you're still going to watch this, then just remember that you can easily skip the first 25 minutes, because they add nothing of interest except from some great background music by Strauss. The first 15 minutes or so,.for example, is just a bunch of scenes with some apes in a prehistoric environment, and is totally pointless. To be more general about it, the movie has no point at all. It has way too many scenes that last way too long. The plot is boring nearly all the way. There was some hope for it at a moment in the movie, but nothing exciting happened after all. The ending is also incredibly stupid and a really strange one. This is not a movie. This is total garbage and an insult to all the movie fans out there.",r

I've pondered over the movie for ages now, trying to reason really what it was about and more importantly, what I thought of it. A few moments ago, I saw the movie for the third time, but for the first time I understood it and I understood why it has gone on to become one of the most celebrated movies of all time. I'll be honest; for a long time, I didn't think much of ""2001"" and now that I look back on those previous two experiences of watching it, I feel a little embarrassed that I was so far off the mark before. I just had to learn that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was not a film to be taken at face value; it was about something else. And that something else cannot be determined by a majority. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is about the individual's relation to the universe around him, and because human minds are as infinite as the stars, they are just as varied.",v

33,4 August 2005,lee_eisenberg,10, Are machines more human than humans?,"Most people probably know the story. One group of apes forces another away from a water hole. The other group then comes across the monolith, which seems to imbue them with a new ability. One of the apes realizes that he can use a bone as a weapon, and forces the other group away from the water hole. Millions of years later, a bunch of people on the moon discover the monolith, which has indeterminate effects on their equipment. Eighteen months later, supercomputer HAL tells astronaut Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) that there will be a failure. When the failure never happens, Dave and his co-astronaut Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) realize that HAL may be malfunctioning and get into a pod so that they can talk about disabling him. But HAL can read their lips, and begins plotting against them. He kills Poole, and so Dave quickly disables him. After coming across the monolith, Dave then goes through a time-space continuum, which ends with him seeing an elderly version of himself. The elderly version then sees an even older version. The older version sees the monolith, which then portrays a fetus, which seems to introduce a new stage of humanity.",

35,29 August 2002,indraya,10, film is a poetical contemplation of most exciting eternal questions,"This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression. Perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way. The story itself is quite simple at a first glance. As the title implies, there is an archetypal journey, a motive repeated for thousands of years. This motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time, and beyond, but also had rich philosophic meaning. The film is a poetical contemplation of most exciting eternal questions. It is not just an odyssey of a person; it is an odyssey of our species. The film is great by itself, yet, in my case, the impression from it will always be mingled with that from the book. I've read it at the age of 10, really not thinking about problems like 'what is the relationship between evolution of humankind and development of human morality'. But the impression was great enough to make me fall for entire genre of science fiction.",
36,11 December 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, I am speechless...,"Having just seen this fantastic film, I'm left puzzled, amazed, impressed and in complete and utter awe of Kubrick's cinematic genius. I had not expected anything to impress me as much as A Clockwork Orange, but I was pleasantly surprised. While I do find A Clockwork Orange to be a better film, I must say that this comes incredibly close... and what determines this might be the fact that, while I fully understood A Clockwork Orange(at least after my second viewing) I'm quite confused by this film. I don't entirely understand the ending, and a few various things throughout the film, but that doesn't lower my score. Not the slightest. Do you know why? Well, partly because Arthur C. Clarke, the co-writer of the screenplay once said: ""If you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered."" And partly because the very visuals of this film warrant a perfect rating of 10. I would be lying if I claimed to ever have seen such beautiful visuals as the ones throughout the film, and in particular the very end... stunning. Simply stunning. Something that I found interesting was how many times Kubrick simply used the visuals to tell the story(as opposed to dialog) and how often he simply let us enjoy the sight of the spacecrafts or the planets... instead of giving us a few unsatisfying quick cuts like a typical Hollywood director would have done. Kubrick is in no hurry to tell us this story... in fact, he wants us to relax and just be whisked away on this journey. He sets a mood like no other director has ever done, and he never breaks this mood. His use of music, while not as deliciously ironic as it is in A Clockwork Orange, is great. There are two scenes which have been referenced so many times, both content-wise and music-wise, in so many different mediums that I doubt anyone can keep track of how many parodies or references there are to them... this is, of course, the famous Dawn of Man scene, and a recurring external space scene. The plot is great. The pacing is good, considering that it's Kubrick... usually, his films are slower, but this one never really felt that slow. The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is all great. The music/score is great. The visuals of the film are amazing. I know I'm praising every aspect of the film here, but I truly think it is that good; it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, and definitely the best visually. Finally, I'll just mention that normally I hate science fiction that deals(even slightly) with extraterrestrial activity/life and space travel. I recommend this film to any fan of high-quality science fiction and any fan of Stanley Kubrick. 10/10",

42,2 January 2007,DeathFish,10, Beauty is underestimated.,"This movie is not just good, its amazing. Besides providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and a lot more, it was an, until then, completely unseen world to the public. This is the first sci-fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words. I am only 16 years old, and therefore I was raised into a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies. But nonetheless I was really, and I mean completely, blown away by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. The visual effects was just one of the merits of this movie, the camera was in true Kubrick style amazing and enchanting. It feels like you are consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the round control room or whatever you call it). The effects, the camera and the sheer size of this movie caught me of my guards even though I had seen the rating before I bought it. But this movie has more to it than this. The meaning of this movie can also be interpreted as you wish yourself, even though I think there are some clear points concerning humanity (also true Kubrick style). How humanity on top of its evolution is just maintenance on board, and therefore not needed by the computer, one of humanities tools. How we in space appear like babies, learning to walk once more, losing control of our tools in zero-gravity, breathing through equipment as fish out of water. On the peak of evolution, we set out into the never-ending adventure as simple primates. Many might think that the length and slow pace of this movie is, boring? ridicules? or just a waste of time. But before you can jump to those conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time with calm music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes. This is to illustrate the beauty of it. Beauty, beauty is in many cases not granted the rightful respect by viewers. Kubrick wants to show us beauty, and if we do not succumb to it and relax, we can not enjoy this film as it was intended. This is not an ordinary movie, we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies, this requires time, thoughts and above all commitment and feelings to watch. All of this together, makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving pictures. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.",

No serious cinemaphile can deny the majesty and beauty of this film, nor can they deny its unique position in cinema history. Much like earlier films such as ""King Kong,"" the Kubrick masterwork ushered in a new age of film-making that paved the way not only for the giddy, fantastical, and profitable excitement of ""Star Wars"" (1977), a groundbreaker in its own right, but also an entire wave of ""smart"" films of speculative fiction, especially those involving machine intelligence. Think ""Silent Running"" and ""Colossus: The Forbin Project,"" ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Terminator,"" etal, right down to recent films like ""AI"" and ""I, Robot"" (which is admittedly based on an Asimov tale that pre-dates ""2001,"" but never mind).

49,7 May 2009,fukoffdickface,1, Drivel,"This is certainly one of the most boring and meaningless films I have ever seen in my life. I love science and science fiction both. They are in fact 2 of my main interests in life. This movie still bored me beyond description! The accolades being heaped upon this hunk of garbage is hilarious. The most amusing tendency among the fans of this movie is ridiculing those who think it is boring and meaningless as stupid, ignorant or both. I am a professional in the computer design and engineering business. I am not stupid. And guess what? This movie is still boring and meaningless. It does have some of the best special effects of its era. In fact, most of the effects in this film would stand next to todays advanced digital special effects without being embarrassed. This is the one and only redeeming quality of this film. It's a collection of very long, very boring scenes that never seem to end. People have mentioned some of the most boring parts. The problem in listing them all is that it would be much easier to list the parts which are NOT boring babble. This movie is a complete waste of.....what seemed like 20 hours of my life. I highly recommend that you never waste time on such trash. For those who will attempt to dismiss my comment along with the other people they have dismissed let me be perfectly clear. I understood everything in the film. It is simply a terrible film. This pseudo-intellectual drivel is a director who thinks he's quite brilliant in his high school level presentation and vision of the journey of man. Of course he is very wrong indeed! If you enjoy this then I suggest you browse youtube for videos made by either inarticulate adults, or videos posted by immature children expressing their simplistic ideas of the world and mankind. The director is incompetent. What takes him 15 minutes of very boring film, a segment he labels ""the dawn of mankind"", near the beginning of the film is a segment that a skilled filmmaker would be able to accomplish in about 2 minutes at most. In fact that sums up what this movie really is. Very simplistic ideas drawn out, and I do mean DRAWN OUT SEEMINGLY FOREVER, in an effort to convince the audience that the filmmakers were very smart people. Hold a copy of the movie in your hand and you will see the condescension dripping from it. It's disjointed. It lacks cohesiveness. It adds elements of science fiction, horror, fantasy, and pre-teen created entertainment. It also fails to deliver in any of these categories. Stop attacking those who do not like this film. They aren't nearly as stupid as is implied here. This movie really does suck this bad. It's almost entirely comprised of shots and contrived scenes which are intended to showcase the effects. Nice effects. Utterly worthless film. Obtain and enjoy some of the many great documentary films about the space program if you want to see great scenery of space. To complete this huge hunk of celluloid garbage, the filmmakers end it with scenes that are not only long but can only be compared to patients in an insane asylum babbling incoherently. No we're not stupid. This movie just sucks. Beauty? Hardly. Deep? If you have a 5th grade education perhaps. Worth watching? Absolutely not! There is nothing brilliant about meaningless film that must be ""interpreted"" by the few viewers who claim they have the answer. Thats just incompetent lazy film making.",

This a film that takes your brain, chops it into little tiny pieces, puts it back together perfectly, and puts back in your head at the end of the movie. It is so strange that I love it so much. By the end of the movie I felt like I was a different person. I was still exactly the same, but something felt different. It moves slowly, but that lets you feel every moment of it. The use of sound in the film is the best I have ever heard. The music and sound editing is just amazing. The visuals for the time sent sci-fi in a new kind of direction. Hal-9000 is one of the greatest villains ever. I could go on for days. This film is amazing.",
51,20 May 2001,kinolieber,10, Some remarks from someone who was there...,"I find the divergent comments about this film quite interesting. It's either a masterpiece and suprmely involving or it's a worthless boring fake. I think if you were in a Cinerama theatre and had the experience that Kubrick intended, there would be no doubt that you had just seen one of the great films of all time. The pacing of this film is absolutely dependent upon the overwhelming size of the image and the detail of the soundtrack. There is no way to describe in words the power of the first time I heard the Zarathustra theme in a Cinerama theatre. It went way beyond what you would experience even in a concert hall since the music surrounded you and the volume and fidelity were simply overwhelming. This is a film that had people shaking and giddy following the title card! And so it goes for the rest of the film. What may seem slow and uneventful on a video screen was just what was required for an audience to absorb all the visual and aural information. Those stills for example, at the start of the film were accompanied by desert sounds that were so real you expected a cricket to hop out from under your seat. And the long sequences outside the Jupiter ship involving the AE35 unit are entirely engrossing and set one up for the silent horror that ensues. ",
52,2 June 2009,kenjha,4, A Snail Odyssey,"Kubrick has made some great films. He also made this drivel - a space film that moves at a snail's pace and has no plot or meaning. The first third of the film, including the never-ending opening sequence with monkeys, is mind-numbingly boring. The last third, a psychedelic trip across space and time, is fascinating - if one's on drugs. Only the middle part, featuring that funny guy HAL 9000, is somewhat interesting. To the masses who adore this indulgent nonsense about monoliths and star babies, it supposedly reveals great truths about life, the universe, and everything. The real truth is that the emperor is not wearing any clothes.",

This film influenced science fiction of the future, so without this film there would be no Star Wars. This film influenced the style of future directors like Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott, whom are fantastic filmmakers. Not only is the film influential, it's also a great movie in general. When it was first released in 1968, it was met with mixed reviews. People saw a vision that has not been seen before, and they had no idea what to think of it. I read reports of walkouts at the premiere that occurred and those who remained complained of boredom. The film is deliberately slow-paced, but my interest was held over the duration of the film. I loved the film very much, but there are so many complicated ideas. Your brain is meant to be put to use because of all these abstract ideas. I've seen the film three times already, and I'm still not sure if I fully grasped all the concepts of the film. But the bottom line is 2001 is more concerned about inspiring our awe, not thrills.",

I'm afraid I can't do that.","A half-century later, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" remains a remarkable achievement for its visionary producer / director Stanley Kubrick, who wrote the screenplay with noted author Arthur C. Clarke. Its visuals were state-of-the-art at the time, and they are still impressive all these years later. It depicts the contact that mankind has with aliens over thousands of years, beginning in the ""Dawn of Man"" when various ape-men puzzle over a strange new artifact in their world. It then makes a hard cut to the early 21st century, when space has been colonized and something amazing has been discovered beneath the surface of the moon. Then, we jump ahead again to a mission to Jupiter, commandeered by astronauts Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). They will have their hands full, dealing with a problematic artificial intelligence named HAL (voiced by an eerily calm Douglas Rain), after which Dave is taken on a truly startling final journey.",

61,31 December 2019,Kingslaay,8," Powerful film, a film about humanity","2001 is the deepest and most thought provoking film I have ever seen. I had to read a lot about its hidden meaning to truly appreciate what Kubrick was trying to show us. Kubrick relies on limited dialogue and conveys a visual experience instead. It will take the average viewer time and reflection to figure this movie out, if one can figure it out. 2001 is so ahead and transcends so much that we are used to in terms of plots, twists and so on when it comes to film.",
62,7 April 2016,Chance_Boudreaux19,7, The special effects are better than CGI in most movies today,"I neither love nor hate this movie which is rare, most people seem to have pretty strong feelings towards it either way. The best thing about this movie is that it looks fantastic, the special effects look better than most movies today which again proves that practical effects will always be better than CGI which can look fake at time. A lot of work went into those effects and I can appreciate them and think about how they made it all look so real in the 60s. Where the movie falters is the plot because what is the plot of this movie? The characters have almost no personality and are just tools in the movie, the best character and the only one which has an arc is of course HAL-9000 which is an AI. HAL is menacing and creepy and all the scenes with him were great. I wish the movie followed Dr Floyd and had him go to Jupiter and beyond because his personality was being established and he could have been more developed, instead we get two astronauts who we are supposed to care about but we don't because we just met them and don't know much about them. Furthermore the music is great but really the ritualistic sounds that start playing when the monolith appears would have made any scene creepy, I could have filmed myself looking in the mirror and put that music over the video and it would have been creepy. The space travel scene scared me more than many horror scenes probably because of the subliminal messages combined with the music, Stanley Kubrick is a master of creating creepy scenes that scare me even though they are technically not scary, the way he combines music and visuals to create atmosphere is perfect. All in all the movie is a special effects showcase and the effects do look great but that is not enough for this movie to be one of my favorites. People complain about the Transformers movies being just a showcase of special effects but this movie is exactly that. Now I am not saying the Transformers movies are better because they are not, they are so visually loud they are bound to give anyone a headache but I am just saying that both Transfomers and 2001 are made to showcase special effects and of course 2001 does it much better. It is however a dish that looks like the best thing in the world but the taste doesn't live up to it. Still I enjoyed it despite being bored in a few sections of ships docking and other things and I kind of dig the weird ending, it is definitely a movie I can appreciate on many levels but I just think it could have been so much more.",

It opens with prehistoric imagery as a tribe of apes discovers a tool called weapon, which introduces the wrath of war. It is a portrayal of man's senseless nature in violence and the inventions we use against one another. Eventually the apes are disturbed by the sudden appearance of a black rectangular object. We are then given a brilliant time lapse as a bone hurls through the air to a cut to a spacecraft. Amazing visual wonders aboard the craft including a computer named Hal that seems to have a mind of its own. Director Stanley Kubrick is brilliant especially having already made Dr. Strangelove and Lolita. Unknown cast include Keir Dullea who attempts to counter Hal but consequently faces the unknown future. William Sylvester is seen making a video call to his daughter before disappearing. Gary Lockwood plays an ill fated astronaut also out to counter Hal. And Daniel Richter is the head ape in the opening tribal footage. Douglas Rain provides the ominous voice of Hal 9000 in a reference to technology merging ahead. Theme addresses man's failure to condemn his pride and his ignorance to that he creates.

I was very surprised by the film in the way it wasn't boring at all like some people I knew had told me. It is a truly thought-provoking, awe-ispiring work, always intriguing and unpredictable, standing head and shoulders above almost every other sci-fi film ever made. No other film I have ever seen captured my sense of wonder and my subconscious so deeply. I still can't keep it away from my thoughts. It is without a doubt Kubrick's most accomplished work to date (I have seen most of his movies).

All of the people in this film are very good. The beginning is a one of the most unique introductions ever in a film in My opinion. The Apes all looked real and the behavior and characteristics were good. The mystery that surrounds everything is fantastic. Hal is really a baddie and I just love the horror and spookiness in some scenes. The special effects are simply beautiful and is arguably the greatest and most realistic looking ever in cinema history! The music is fabulous! Though some of the things in the movie maybe easy to figure out I for one have not figured out everything in this movie. Anyone looking for a superb science fiction mystery then I strongly recommend 2001: A Space Odyssey!,

(Would 2001 be the classic it is without those fx...?) Still, although it was Trumball and company who actually played the tune, it was Kubrick who conducted the orchestra. (Six of one, half dozen of the other...?) Storywise, 2001 leaves gaping holes big enough to house a million Monoliths. Why, for instance, did the aliens give Man his very first WEAPON instead of a tool that might make for a far brighter future (the wheel, say)? And was there just ONE Monolith, or THREE? Was the Monolith on Earth the same one that was later discovered on the Moon (or the one that appears at the end of the movie)? The entire Moon sequence could've been cut without adversely affecting the narrative in any way, but I must confess a fondness for The Blue Danube Waltz. Was HAL sabotaged by the aliens to somehow TEST Man's worthiness to make it to The Next Evolutionary Step? 2001 leaves a lot of questions unanswered (I saw it TWICE in theaters, hoping to pick up on details the second time around that I'd missed during my first go, but no such luck). The greatest success, early on, seems to have been with the very ""stoners"" who would make Tolkein's books runaway hits, but there are STILL a lot of unanswered questions.",

77,9 February 2001,Aylmer,3, 2001: A Solar Bore,"Possibly the most overrated science fiction film ever made, 2001: A Space Odyssey is more eye-candy than substance. Supposedly the film tells how extraterrestrial powers are behind the evolution of intelligence in humans or something to that effect, but in my opinion the film brings this message out in a very heavy-handed and overblown way. The first 20 minutes or so of the film aren't much more complex than your usual National Geographic primate documentary, instead with actors in ape suits in the place of real apes. Of course for no discernible reason, a monolith appears in the middle of an ape-tribe's camp overnight and merely the act of briefly pawing it makes them smart enough to use bones as weapons. Kubrick was obviously trying to make the monolith and its powers seem mystical and beyond the realm of human comprehension, but in this case he leaves too much to the imagination, as in failing to explain how the monolith got there, how it distributes intelligence, and why it would do such a thing. It's never explained, as very little is explained over the course of the film. Most of the film seems similarly vague and ambiguous, resulting in a downward spiral of confusion and boredom.",

Thankfully, there are so many demystifications out there if you're not one of those creative types and the beauty of this film is that it fits into any of those decrypts, because that's how generic it is intentionally made by the creator such as to let the audiences to fill the gap as per their imaginations, which again makes this film as a very unique film.",

You'll hear people talking about how impressive the special effects were, what a mind- blowing experience the film is, but what was it all about? The clue is in the third chapter of John's Gospel when Jesus tells Nicodemus that ""unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God."" If you don't understand this, you won't understand the film, because the screenwriters apply this saying in both a literal and a figurative sense throughout the action. The context of the climax is entirely theological and it's because of the film's strong religious overtones even more than its brilliantly conceived vistas of man's technological horizons, that 2001 has acquired such a reputation and such a cult following.",

My reactions are emotional, although I think I could wade in the same waters as some of my predecessors. My approach to movies is to take them as they come.  I am so tired of all the talk about special effects that begin almost every review.  If you have a high profile film, the special effects are treated as if they are some a form unto themselves, as if they were actually removed from the film. Didn't like the special effects.  Didn't like the movie.  Sit down for a moment and look at this film.  It's wonderful that Kubrick was able to do what he did with those effects, but the way this movie unfolds is so  much more than that.  This movie is there to portray a sense of the awe of the universe and the future of humankind based on the increments that have led us there.  It is about a future that may occur.",

I don't know if any film fan can appreciate it but it's really a must see for all SF fan: we got everything: space, aliens, robots, origin of humanity Beyond this theme, it's a rare movie that mixes brilliantly a challenging script with amazing visuals! Sure as the movie is from 1968, some effects look sometimes a bit out of time but it still has more punch than most SF movies done after! For me, the explanation comes from Kubrick's simple vision: he shots SF like real daily life, with no big things: a big frame and slow pace are just needful as what we see is already extraordinary! I have fun to watch it now as I have picked Clarke's novels as my summer books (proof of the enduring quality of the work) and so I have just finished to read the novel: the two are really variations around the same stories and really help each other.

It is more deep, profound and complex than any other work I've ever seen. I am still completely baffled by elements of it. I have my own interpretations, as everyone does, and I can see the connections between everything but I'm sure it is far more complex than my rather simplistic interpretation. Just everything about it (the ""Dawn of Man"", HAL, beyond the infinite, the monolith, the Star Child) is absolutely mind blowing. I still can't seem to grasp my head around the perfection that I just experienced. Technically speaking, it's a marvel. The cinematography and visual effects are sensational, and it is rare to find ones superior. I wasn't bored for a second. There are a few instances where the story seems to drag a little bit, but it's necessary to further the story and explain everything that is occurring. Without these little drags, the story would be just full of holes and situations that are left unexplained. However, Kubrick recognizes this slight dullness and uses remarkable visuals, cinematography and a booming score to keep the viewer thoroughly engaged no matter what the situation. It's been over an hour and a half since I finished the film and I am still stunned, basking in it's supreme magnificence. Certainly one of the finest achievements of all time, and easily the best Kubrick I've seen so far. Exceeded any expectation I had.",
99,19 November 2016,PetarNeo,10, Extraordinarily exceptional,"Movie is probably one of the biggest hits in the world with it's requirement for audience to feel like participants while they are constantly being presented with scenes that require some thinking and creating an opinion. It was incredibly shoot with some of the incredible beautiful scenes and scenes like when HAL is looking onto lips of our two guys giving you idea that it's highly advanced but incredibly dangerous and powerful. HAL is presented as highly advanced computer (intelligence) that has potential which when released is powerful and influential. Sequences in the beginning of the movie are incredible as you are forced to conclude everything and round up some sort of opinion and perspective that later on you will use to understand some of scenes. Everything in the movie is magnificent form soundtrack that brings tension and tries to prepare you for incoming events, to incredible dialogues and mind blowing scenes that are also beautifully created. As the ending of the movie is concerned, it was an extraordinary experience for almost 20 minutes. They have only one thing that are doing and that is making you think what is that you are seeing and is there anything that you might get from it.

101,27 October 2006,karl_consiglio,10, A truly amazing experience,"Kubrick is a genius and none can deny the superb special effects in this film so ahead of its time. Kubrick here achieves the promise of science fiction literature, bringing the beauty of space travel to the screen in believable form. The film opens with a prehistoric tableau: sub-human man is confronted by a huge black obelisk, an alien artifact that somehow teaches man the use of tools(and weapons). The implication is clear: man's one crucial step towards native intelligence was prompted by intelligence from the stars. Kubrick then cuts to his vision of 2001, on a space station high above Earth, and the figure of Dr Floyd who is being transferred to the moon to study a mysterious black obelisk recently discovered/excavated from beneath the Lunar surface. Our cameraman is afraid to approach this monolith as us astronauts approach and then the light of the sun hits it and a piercing signal is transmitted to the vicinity of Jupiter. Determined to investigate what lies at the other end of the signal, an expedition is mounted and eighteen months later, the great ship ""Discovery"" departs from Earth orbit. Fashioned in space, this beautiful monster carries two astronauts and three other scientists in suspended animation in the company of a smooth talking computer named HAL-9000, which seems to have developed a curious personality of its own. Hal is an adolescent in human terms, has a pathological fear of being turned off; to protect itself, the computer kills an astronaut, terminates the life functions of the three men in deep freeze and exiles another guy to slow death in a space repair pod. One man unable to reenter the ship through the normal hatches, all of which are controlled by the machine, opens a manual hatch, blows in without a space suit, and activates the airlock, penetrating the ""Discovery"" without any apparent damage(the other guy should be long dead by now) HAL is terminated after telling this guy about his mission. A third monolith is discovered on one of Jupiter's moons, and it throws the astronaut through a magnificent, most spectacular light show. At this point the remaining audience who had the patience to enjoy the film's earlier slow pace are thanking the good Lord for what they are witnessing, we have come so far. This ""light show"" kind of space travel is meant to represent or suggest some kind of mental transformation or another dimension in space or time, or both. Bowman lives out his days in plush quarters on the Jovian moons, and when he dies, is reborn again in an alien embryo, hovering over the turning green sphere of the Earth. 2001 is a major cinematic experience I discovered in my late Grandfather's video collection years ago and since then I've seen it over and over even if its a pretty long movie, its always a pleasure. After this film movie makers everywhere started taking the sci-fi genre more seriously. 2001 gave the science fiction film respectability, and a sense of growing maturity.",

Kubrick and co-writer Arthur C.

I'd like to know where it is written that a film has to explain itself to you.  I saw 2001 when it first opened. I was with five other people.  We discussed the film for two hours.  When was the last time that happened?  For those of you who felt it was slow, so is space travel.  Get it! There ain't no Warp Factor 1. Secondly, the ending: has nobody ever read anything by Arthur C. Clarke? One of the recurring themes in Clarke's work is that any civilization sufficiently advanced over humankind would seem like Magic, or even Gods.  If you didn't understand the ending, perhaps you weren't supposed to.  Isn't it possible that Kubrick was giving you the experience of how clueless we would all be if confronted by an intelligence millions of years ahead of us.  Look, opinions are like rear ends, everybody has them, but when people put this film down as garbage or the equivalent, it tells me that they aren't thinking it through. Television and motion pictures are very passive media.  They supply you with 100% of audio and video.  Old time radio forced the listener to be imaginative and conjure up the picture. Surprisingly, it's not difficult to do that at all. Here is a film that dares to be somewhere between radio and the visual media.  It doesn't hand you all the answers on a silver platter.  Like a really good computer game you have to figure them out. Whether you liked it or not is your decision. Enough very knowledable people in the film world have viewed it and deemed it one of the great masterpieces of film. As many have said, it's an experience.

That's right, a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own. This was made in 1968 and to think by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke. If this was in 3064 a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this. There is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion. It provokes two reactions and one is called sleep. The film starts with nothing but a pitch black screen for well over two minutes. Then, the first shot we see that has some kind of lighting is ""The Dawn of Man"" sequence. So, if it's in chronological order, the blackness prior to this, is the birth of the world? ",

115,21 August 2019,adam_pittavino,10, The greatest sci fi of them all.,"Stanley Kubrick's '2001 A Space Odyssey is the kind of film that viewers really have to prepare for. Well, thats what I tell people before they devote their precious time to watch sci fi's most admired entry. 2001 opens to desolate plains in prehistoric times. This 15 minute sequence demonstrates how ape-like creatures can use the bones of an animal to kill a tribal rival. During all this, a bizzare alien monolith appears and causes bewilderment amongst the primates. Just as the bone is hurled into the air to signify celebration, the film jumps thousands of years into the future as a space station orbits the solar system. We are introduced to Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) who is travelling to the moon with the task of exploring a black monolith that has been found beneath the lunar surface. The monolith starts to beam a heavy transmission toward Jupiter and 18 months later astronauts Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are en route to find answers. Like many of Kubrick's films, we see a lack of emotion and personality from his characters. But in 2001, it exhibits the fact that we may not be superior to the apes, but having access to better equiptment certainly gives the illusion that we are. The most impressive character is a computer named HAL. He is inquisitive, shows empathy and expresses concern toward the activities of the two pilots aboard the space ship Discovery. The actions of HAL that follow are etched into film history, im sure you have heard many impressions of the rouge computer. Dave confronts the monolith, transporting him into an unknown dimension, ageing him beyond belief, before morphing into a shining fetus appearing in space. Its questionable which segment of 2001 is the most memorable, Kubrick merges together an impeccable ensemble of music and stirring visuals to create a movie that doesnt play by the rules that other films adhere to. 2001 is a puzzle that begs to be solved, the ambiguity only adding to the overall brilliance, each and every frame worthy of a discussion, if not a debate.",

117,10 November 2013,blazesnakes9,10, One of the greatest science-fiction movies of all time,"Stanley Kubrick is a movie director that can do no wrong. His vision is far more strange and thought-provoking than any other director on this planet. When he died in 1999, the world was saddened by the news of his death. But, his films didn't died, either. He left behind some of his best work to all to see. In my opinion, he left behind a lot of questions with one particular movie that really stands out as being one of the best science-fiction movies of all time. The name of the movie is 2001: A Space Odyssey, and even after 45 years, it still holds up. The movie takes place in the futuristic year of 2001, where a space crew investigates a unknown monolith that is excavated out of the Moon. The scientists don't know who put the monolith there, or how it ended up on the Moon. But, there's more to the story than investigation. Another monolith appears during the Dawn of Man sequence, where humans in the beginning of civilization were primitive apes. Meanwhile, the space crew's computer, HAL 9000, get involves in the mission and determines to find out the answer. One of the scientists on board questions about the technology of the HAL 9000 computer. What the space crew doesn't know is that HAL 9000 has a mind of his own. He is also very deadly when discovering about the unknown monolith, and even jeopardizes the astronauts onboard. He eventually kills some of them and even locks out Dr. Dave Bowman in his pod. Dave soon gets into the spaceship and deactivate HAL 9000 and then goes a mind-trip through the star-gate. One of the greatest achievements in 2001 is the mind-blowing special effects that the movie possess. A lot of science-fiction movies are jam-packed with wall-to-wall special effects, making the story harder to follow. In 2001, those special effects don't get in the way. Instead, the special effects makes us look in awe. It's the inspiration that the movie makes for us. Kubrick's vision of the future is far from being made in 1968, but there are other elements that 2001 have that makes more unique. The relationship between HAL 9000 and Dave Bowman is significant mainly because, Kubrick sets up the relationship that can take an a effect on a human being. HAL 9000 is a computer that likes to meddle with people. He is complicated in his own ways of destruction and murder. In other words, HAL 9000 can't function accordingly. It's that story that make us think about the relationship between man and machine. The monoliths also serves a significant role as well. In my own perspective of watching 2001, I think that the monoliths serves as a part of life. The Dawn of Man sequence in 2001 and the ending are crucial points to the movie. In the beginning, man is ape in a world that is inhabited by other members that make up civilization. By the end, Bowman is near death, but he is reincarnated through the monolith that is placed in his bedroom. It follows the phrase, ""What comes around, goes around."" Kubrick's direction is also very descriptive and never fails to mislead us. He uses long shots of people inside the space station. He puts us in Bowman's perspective when he is traveling through the star-gate. If I had to say something about the star-gate sequence, I would say that the questions relies on the mysteries of science and technology itself. The point is, there may be another dimension outside outer space, one that is never been seen before. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a great movie. Not only great, but magnificent in its own way. The music sets up the movie as a space opera and moves very steady on the details and visual effects. In the past years, 2001: A Space Odyssey has been criticized as being the greatest science-fiction movies of all time. I can't agree more. It is also one of my favorites. It belongs on my top 10 favorite movies list and it fully deserves to be placed there. A feast for the eyes, ears and mind for all to see and hear, and also for all generations of movie directors. Kubrick should be proud. ★★★★ 4 stars.",

I thought perhaps my younger self was too hard on this film. But no, I still hate it; it is a terrible film. It is too long, too slow, annoying tones and sounds most of the way, annoying moving/spinning camera views, dialogue is sparse and too low, very little plot or action. Just an awful awful film. The decent special effects offer no solace as this film is just that bad. Avoid at all costs, don't make the mistake of giving it another shot, yes it is that bad and yes the reviewers are that wrong. Unfortunately I let them make me feel mistaken, but no I am reminded once again that there are shills out there with agendas; it's like they get off on trying to sell you trash as gold -- the con of it.

127,27 November 2006,bw92116,10, Masterful and influential epic film - and boring to those with inactive minds,"Sadly it appears that younger generations of filmgoers don't appreciate this film. Having been raised on frenetic, action-packed ""science fiction"" films like the Star Wars and Matrix series, and having spent too much time immersed in the chaotic frenzy of video games, they finally sit down to ""2001"" and are bored and frustrated by it. Well, naturally, if you're used to films in which every three seconds there is a crash, a special effect, a sex joke, an explosion or a killing - then you attempt to watch a slow, ponderous film like ""2001"" you're going to get bored. For those people, this is an education in what cinema can be. Science fiction doesn't have to be horror, comedy or martial arts. It can be literature and philosophy. ""2001"" dares to ask meaningful questions of the viewer, for example, ""What is mankind's place and purpose in the universe?"" And it doesn't provide all the answers. It challenges the viewer to come up with his/her own answers. Other issues, such as man vs. machines of man's invention, and the possibility of higher ""intelligence"" than man existing, are also also addressed but not given pat or preachy answers. The ambiguity is part of the appeal of this film, in addition to the spectacular visuals. The slow pace and long scenes give the viewer a chance to digest and contemplate what he/she has just seen and heard, while the film is still in progress. The long scene of the spacewalk with the only sound being the astronaut's breathing is intended to make the viewer a little uncomfortable. The extended special effects sequence near the end is almost like taking a hallucinogenic drug, but without the need to actually take one. This film, like other wide-screen epics (Lawrence of Arabia et. al.) really needs to be seen in a theater with a large screen and good sound system, or at least on a large, high-quality video screen with good sound. I was lucky to get to see it at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood in 1973, and it was shown with an intermission - and the soundtrack included an ""overture"" which was played before the curtain even went up, and also at the end of the intermission, to help set the mood. Of course the cinematography is masterful - space travel never looked this elegant or beautiful, in any other film save possibly ""Apollo 13."" Beyond that, it is the intellectual challenge that the film presents to the viewer that makes this film so memorable.",

The special effects were for its time revolutionary. And there is a truly fascinating story there to be told. Unfortunately it is in the storytelling that 2001 suffers. The film raises many questions, then spends over two hours not answering them. For much too much of that time absolutely nothing happens. But you stay with it because there seems to be the possibility of a great payoff at the end. Yet the ending frustrates just as much as all that came before it, perhaps more so. You may well find yourself saying ""I waited two hours for THAT? And what the heck was that anyway?"" I do not believe a movie has to lay all the answers out for you. Some of the best films of all time are very much left open to your own interpretation. But the answers we are given here are so unsatisfying and ultimately confusing that we wonder why we went through the trouble of watching at all.",
130,20 August 2021,nickenchuggets,10," ""I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that""","This is an enormous movie to talk about, so I will just start by saying it really is astonishing how such a thing was accomplished in the 60s. However, when you stop to consider the one and only Kubrick was behind this, it suddenly seems much more believable. 2001 is a film that has done a great deal to influence and shape other science fiction movies that have followed it. There are many reasons for this, including the way the movie accurately portrays space travel, the loneliness of taking part in an extraterrestrial voyage, and most importantly, the awe-inspiring camerawork. If you've never seen this movie, there's no way for you to understand. The camera angles and cinematography on display here are out of this world (literally). Kubrick used a lot of wide shots in order to give a realistic feeling of scale to the viewer and help them understand how vast and seemingly endless the universe is. A strange thing about this movie (even though the movie as a whole is strange) is how despite its impressive runtime and huge scope, there's not much in the way of a storyline. It's not that there isn't much to look at, because there certainly is. It's just that the plot will leave the average audience absolutely confused beyond belief, even after finishing the movie. It begins with (of all things) a group of prehistoric monkeys fighting each other. An odd, black, rectangular structure appears before them, seemingly from out of nowhere. The monolith seems to influence their way of thinking and make them more intelligent, allowing some of the apes to use primitive weapons and beat their rivals savagely to death. Thousands of centuries later, a Doctor Floyd is busy travelling to a type of secret base on the moon's surface. There, he encounters the same rectangular object the apes saw millions of years earlier. The movie then abruptly moves to a large spaceship called Discovery One, which is conducting a voyage to the gas planets in the outer solar system. Dr. David Bowman is taking part and is responsible for answering to the deceptively sinister HAL 9000; a supercomputer with a glowing red eye that controls the vast majority of the ship's abilities. Some time later, HAL tells David something is wrong with the ship's exterior, prompting him to go take a look in a pod-like vehicle. HAL gets proven wrong and David finds nothing wrong with the ship. Meanwhile, David and another scientist enter a pod to discuss HAL's behavior, which has been getting more hostile as of late. He believes that he can do no wrong because machines (unlike people) are programmed to be infallible. Little do the men know, HAL absorbed every word of their antagonistic conversation. When Dave's friend is outside of the ship later on, HAL cuts his air supply and kills him. He also terminates the life support on the other scientists in cryogenic stasis, killing them as well. Dave goes outside in a pod to investigate, and HAL locks him out of the ship. He lets Dave know that despite the precautions he took, he was still able to read his lips while talking to the other scientist. After HAL refuses to let Dave back into the ship, he goes in through an airlock, disconnects HAL's wiring, and finds a video saying how the true mission objective is to go to Jupiter to find a radio message. This message was apparently sent by the monolith. Once at Jupiter, Dave experiences something unlike anything ever seen before, and he is engulfed by a gigantic wave of swirling, colored light beams. This lasts for quite some time, and when it comes to an end, he's suddenly in a bedroom as an elderly version of himself. As he lies on the bed, the black rectangle appears one last time. It turns him into a fetus and he floats in the earth's orbit in a small ball of light. I really don't understand the ending of this movie, and to be fair, most people would say the same. It's just really weird. There are, of course, many theories as to what it (and the entire movie) means, but those are too lengthy to get into here. What I can comment on are the performances, settings, visuals, and other things you can observe just by letting the movie play. There's no real main character of this movie, that is until the plot introduces the spaceship Discovery. Keir Dullea as David Bowman is a faithful portrayal of a man who has left his homeworld in order to venture into the unknown depths of space. Climbing into the ship for the first time ready to leave earth, he must have felt how the great pilots of the first world war did when they stepped into their planes. New technology can be very dangerous because of its untested nature, and brave men are required to make use of it. Dave embarks on the mission anyway since he is ready to do whatever it takes to advance humanity's understanding of science through exploration. HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain) is definitely the main villain of this movie, although you can argue he's not very antagonistic. He serves as the direct antithesis to Dave, but is introduced as merely the artificial intelligence that controls the spaceship Discovery. At first, this seems like a fine idea, letting computers run spaceships and do mundane tasks. Machines do repetitive processes well. Later on, HAL shows that he is much more than a mere computer. By controlling the ship, he leverages control over the fates of all men onboard. He decides who lives and who dies, which is why Dave must ultimately shut him down. Probably the most amazing aspect of this film for me is how every single visual effect in it was achieved without using a single computer. All the spaceships, strange patterns of light, and everything else was done physically. They used a lot of miniatures to create many of these effects. When you're watching though, you have no idea. It looks that real. Another part of this movie that makes it what it is is the soundtrack. Kubrick utilized a lot of classical music, most memorably during the first few minutes. This is important because 2001 does not have as much dialogue as a typical film, so the music is a useful method for making the audience feel a certain emotion. There are some scenes in the film that feel pretty slow, such as the one or two instances that involve a bunch of guys talking at a press conference, but mostly, I don't see how anyone can be disinterested in 2001. I can't think of many other movies that even come close to being this revolutionary. Science fiction has definitely been done before this, but the sheer size, scale, and multiple interpretations of this film are what makes it one of the best ever made.",

134,23 February 2016,gcarpiceci,10, The sci-fi movie by definition,"This is for me THE sci-fi movie by definition, and I support my pitch with the following facts: # the movie has the ambition to tell the story of human kind from its very remote beginning four million years ago up to its far future; a huge ambition, an almost unbearable burden, but 2001 succeeds: the movie is at the same time highly epic and iconic... # epic: the story is a fantastic journey: four million years ago, a mysterious, superior entity has come on earth to chose the best among all pre-human beings (actually an ape, Moonwatch) to transition his species into its future, i.e. mankind as we know it. Four million years later, the same mysterious entity appears again and again it comes to select the best among all men (Dave Bowman) to do what his precursor had done millions of years before, i.e. to carry his species to the next level. The final amazing journey across time and space, culminating in the birth of the new species, symbolised by the huge phoetus- egg that Bowman has turned in, is a unique filmic experience # iconic: 2001 has changed sci-fi cinema for ever, sci-fi movie have never been the same since. The cinematographic solutions that Scott and his crew have created for 2001 have set new standards for any future sci-fi movie: just think of the way of portraying spaceships, moving very slowly against the infinite background of the deep space instead of being bullet-like objects as they had been shown up to then. Other visuals have been adopted by movies like the fantastic Interstellar (which I loved a lot!): think of the spinning space station, the docking scenes, and even the key visuals of the journey across the wormhole (is this Cooper or David Bowman...?). I watched 2001 back in 1969, and I keep watching it every now and then; another amazing thing of this movie is how watchable still is nearly 50 years after its production, even more so for a sci-fi movie, most of which become obsolete",

The special effects, so impressive some thirty years ago, look mediocre and sometimes plain silly. The fashions and furnishings, designed to predict today, more resemble Montgomery Ward circa 1960.

I had a great deal of expectations when I watched this movie. Many friends said it is superb and I like all the other Kubrick movies I watched so far. But yeah. First of all the complete movie is filmed with a very keen eye on details. The ape costumes for example are great and the space vessels seem very realistic. The effects are much ahead of its time and are still remarkable today. But there is much missing. After the initial ape scene, which has some great shots the really boring part begins. Wee see spaceships with Strauss' Danube waltz in the background. It is pretty, for about 5 minutes, but after it is just boring. The music keeps repeating and all is very very slow. Some of the former critics say that you have to appreciate the beauty in it. Well spacecrafts aren't exactly beautiful and the statement, you have to enjoy this movie as a picture is stupid, because it is a movie after all. Maybe Kubrick chose the wrong medium for his 'art'. Later on even the music itself stops and it gets worse and worse. Some critics said the ships must be slow for being realistic. That is stupid, because in space velocity is relative and it wouldn't be less realistic if the ship was faster or slower. Over all there isn't much of a plot, which doesn't need to be a bad thing if the rest is entertaining. But it isn't entertaining, therefore plot is missing. I have to admit, that the end became interesting again. After a psychedelic sequence, where one doesn't know what it means come a few very good scenes. My friend insisted, that one can't really grasp the whole thing without reading the book along. But that is not the characteristic of a great movie. The psychedelic experience could also have been caused by a lack of oxygen leading to a dream sequence. One couldn't know the difference. I believe, if you'd take only the first ape sequence and the last aging and rebirth sequence you would really get a fascinating movie. What I most hate about the movie are the people watching it and telling me it is one of the best movies of all time. These are the same kind of people that visit an art gallery for the sake of telling other people that they are interested in art. Even my friend, who praised the movie, suddenly admitted that the movie is in fact boring for the most part. Art is not good because it bores you. It is the same mentality as saying, that culture has to be boring and that boring things are culture. And yes, I am not the kind of person who loves action movies. If it would be an intelligent movie, it wouldn't be boring, because really intelligent movies aren't boring. People brag about the philosophical meanings of this movie. What is the meaning of a flying spacecraft? Why has to be a philosophical meaning in a fictional short story containing aliens teaching mankind? There simply isn't one. Most people say that this movie is awesome because their friends do and this makes me angry. To sum it up: Boring as a whole but has some interesting genius scenes.

It is pretty-much divided into ""chapters"" as there is the prologue with the apes which appear to be stimulated into intelligence by the mysterious humming artifacts. The future of commercial and exploratory space travel shown with great examples of models and sets that still hold up today, 50 years later. The future of computers to the point of being an intelligent ""thinking"" life-form with both personality and even paranoia. Everything so carefully thought-out including the spacesuits and equipment. On the negative side, there are long passages of plot exposition and detail that border on the mundane and boring. A puzzling ending that I didn't understand until I read the novel, and now it makes perfect sense to me! Kubrick had one fault in most of his movies, and was that he never cut his scenes for time or continuity, and tended to go on too long. However, when you watch it, you will find that perhaps it is more enjoyable in several ""parts"". I often pace it for viewing on disc, this way. Still controversial after all these years. The 15 minute ""star-trip"" is still enjoyable , but my ""drug of choice"" these days is merely alcohol!",

Kubrick is clearly a genius, especially for his filming of the ending of the film. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a real pillar of all Sci-Fi cinema, it is difficult to imagine how many paintings drew inspiration from A Space Odyssey.

166,4 February 2004,stamper,3," Monkey madness, space ballet and an out of psychotic computer","With 2001 Stanley Kubrick succeeded in merging monkey madness, space ballet and an out of control computer by the use of an odyssey through space and time. What he did not succeed in, was in making a good film. Of course, by the standards of the time (1968) the effects were incredible and so were the monkey costumes (compare them with Planet of The Apes, which is also from 1968), but innovation hardly makes a film great. An interesting plot eventually combined with an intriguing style of filming does and that is where Kubrick went wrong with this one.",
167,1 September 2010,Cosmoeticadotcom,10, Great,"the very reasons 2001 succeeds as a great film is not because it simply awes us, although moments do, but because, like all great films, it touches us, and deeply, in ways that many viewers are not even aware of, and none that require genius. The film succeeds in myriad little moments that all can relate to. I mentioned Dr. Floyd's banter with colleagues on the way to the monolith site, but there is the ecstatic 'first violence' in the murder of the rival man-ape early on. This is a vivid redo of the Cain and Abel myth, and how many of us wish we were so excited that we could toss an object into the air like the murderous man-ape does his bone weapon? Then there is Floyd with his daughter on the space videophone, and a circumspect Floyd being confronted by the smiling Russians. There is the scene where Poole gets a video birthday wish from his parents, and acts ho-hum about it. There is the scene where Bowman must release the recaptured corpse of his friend to outer space to save himself and the mission, and the very fact that, despite being on the mission for his cool demeanor, Bowman hurriedly forgets his space helmet to retrieve the body in the first place shows a deep connection between emotion and action that a didactic spoken resolution could never achieve. There are other moments, as well, but it is in these moments, often dismissed as banalities, that the film actually pulls the viewer into the tale. That so many critics miss these rather obvious connections shows just how attuned to lowest common denominator action, violence, and bluntly obvious things, most filmgoers are. Yet, it's the parallax of this lack against the grandness of the other parts of the film that pulls the mind like taffy between the antipodes.

173,27 August 2005,moonspinner55,6, Voice of HAL a performance unto itself...,"US spacecraft bound for Jupiter is controlled by ""foolproof"" computer. Audiences in 1968--mostly the college students who were becoming the country's foremost film enthusiasts--were determined to believe that Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" was a deep thinker (they came to this conclusion because it baffled and confused them--therefore it must be deep). The assemblage and presentation is remarkable, no doubt about it, but how deep the film actually goes is up for debate. Kubrick clearly has filmmaking prowess to spare, and his picture is a stunning achievement on a visual level (one can hardly comprehend how he managed to get this work on the screen without interference--and, if there was behind-the-scenes trouble, that achievement becomes even more heroic). Still, this voyage involving two astronauts battling a brilliant and power-mad computer of their own making is an abstract, psychedelic head trip, either intellectually stimulating or somnolent depending upon one's perceptions and patience. I found much of it, particularly the final act, cold and alienating. I also wasn't overly impressed with the elongated prehistoric prologue, even if the now-celebrated edit from flying bone/weapon to space station in the stars has become the stuff of legend (for the deep thinkers, this clunky-abrupt cut is Exhibit A). You cannot doubt Kubrick's mastery of the cinema (he also produced the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Arthur C. Clarke, from Clarke's uncredited story ""The Sentinel""), and yet the movie has no personality apart from HAL's dejected-spiteful-pitying voice. The terrific cinematography is by Geoffrey Unsworth, with assist from John Alcott. The voice of HAL is Douglas Rain (and it deserves legendary status). The actors--Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood--seem cast for their dullness (intentionally I presume), yet one does eventually tire of them. Kubrick also triumphed when he used classical music to punch up the visuals, putting a pop-art stamp on these legendary pieces. Four Oscar nominations with one win: Best Special Visual Effects (awarded to Kubrick). Five BAFTA nominations with three wins: Best Sound Track, Best Art Direction, and Best Cinematography (awarded to Unsworth). A follow-up, ""2010"", from Clarke's novel--but without Kubrick's participation--arrived in 1984. **1/2 from ****",

Kubrick uses a lot of extended takes and long views to enhance the feeling of distance and enormity of space. also to stress the realism he is going for.

190,22 August 2018,jgcorrea,10, An historical milestone,"As far as meaning, significance and cultural instigation are concerned, 2001 features innumerable referential approaches: to mankind, to God (and/or to the Demon), to the future, to our responsibility as of 1968 as we faced new realities; to the rediscovery of language; to the brand-new systems of knowledge; to the man-vs. -machine struggle. Stanley Kubrick directed this iconic film, in which mankind finds a mysterious, obviously artificial object buried beneath the Lunar surface and, with the help of an intelligent computer HAL 9000, sets off on a quest. Hal is error-proof - his ontology is infallibility. (And Nota bene the homophone pun: Hal is pronounced as hell. Beforehand, during the Paleolithic period, primates faced the mechanics of their primitive, primary life, and their capital objective = simple resistance, at a biological level. Those mankind precursors were not yet fully superior to other animals because they did not have the capacity for symbolic communication; they only communicated through signals. They mastered no connotative capacity at all, only some kinda denotative capacity. Their booming intellect was still impotent for making abstractions. Then an immense, polished, geometric, rectangular monolith, - the revelation of the newly coming Neolithic revolutionized universe (the Polished stone Era) - and subsequently the discovery of the media and the instruments - extensions of our physical members. The unknown monolith is almost an apparition of God. Also the germ of thought. The ape-man assaults the skeleton of a dead animal, picks up a bone (which had previously been used as a weapon to win the battle for a water pool ), begins to brand it euphorically, while disrupting the skeleton, throwing it up in the air and - incidentally the greatest anecdotal ellipse in the history of cinema: - and the bone fuses into a 2001 spaceship, sliding through the imponderable silence of the cosmos, to the sound of Johann Strauss' Blue Danube. The phenomenon is then repeated: the monolith is found on the moon, and the astronauts who approach it exhibit a similar behavior to that of the primates, when they touch it. An expedition to Jupiter, with three crew members in hibernation, only to be restored to their vital faculties when they arrived at the destination, the other two alive, and the electronic computer (Hal), leading the ship. Kubrick & Arthur C Clarke conceived the behavior of the Cyclops-eye machinery by, say, matching Homer's Odyssey. Something like Hal may indeed become reality and be capable of own emotions and mental initiatives. There resides the impasse for mankind, with its philosophical implications.",

Originally he stated ""It was best to feel it, rather than try to clarify some outlandish concept (which might sound foolish)."" Though I don't want to give away the explanation, if you have never seen it. The movie is indeed so far ahead of it's time, it's actually predicting way too much of mankind in 2001, a man mission to Jupiter, really? It was produced at a highly exciting time (for space exploration) and when you certainly had to use your own grey matter just to stay with this epic 'Science Fiction', extravaganza. The opening and closing theme by Richard Strauss, is simply magnifico! The film is so good for the time, many who believe in conspiracy theories suspect Stanley.K (himself), was hired to shoot a fake moon landing! Obviously more bizarre than '2001's' own mind expanding realization.",

After making a name for himself with classic films such as Paths of Glory (1957), Lolita (1962) and Dr. Strangelove (1964), Kubrick bolstered and cemented his reputation as one of the greatest filmmakers ever to grace our planet with the release of 2001, at a time when space exploration looked real and promising.",

Released in the midst of America's initial thrust into the frontier of outer space and one year before the first moon landing, the film's special effects range from the psychedelic ""Stargate"" sequence to nearly documentary realism in the rendering of spacecraft and space travel. Several of the artists and technicians who helped create the film's special effects (especially Douglas Trumbull) were to become the gurus of SF special effects for the next several decades.",

So What?,"Sure, the special effects of this movie were pretty good, even in the year 1968, but c'mon, what else is there to give it praise for? The movie was overlong, boring and made absolutely no sense. I didn't find myself caring for any of the characters, it was horribly directed by Stanley Kubrik and was a poor execution. Call me contemporary, but I like a film where there is a little dialogue, not a complete hour of total silence. I have lots of patience when it comes to film (I enjoyed Citizen Kane, Casablanca and There Will be Blood) but I found this film to be super overrated and shouldn't even be on IMDb's Top 250 List. The Even if they cut an hour, this movie would've and could've been way better. I also heard that Stanley Kubrik cut about 20-30 minutes to make the pacing faster. What pace? It took 2 and a half hours to tell an hour long story. I would sometimes fast forward and I would find that I missed nothing. You'll notice I didn't mention anything about the acting. That's because there was little acting. The only thing we see is actor's expression and small amount of dialogue. The only reason I gave this movie 3 stars is for the HAL storyline. That is the only interesting part of the film. And if you're going to give this film a 10 simply because it has great special effects, then give a 10 to Avatar and Star Wars (OK Star Wars may deserve it, but you get the idea). This film proves that special effects cannot save a film that has horrible directing and a painfully slow story. If any, this is a film that is only for hard core Sci-Fi buffs.

Actually, the short story - called ""Sentinel"" - was FAR better and explained what was going on WAY better than Kubrick did.  The ""trip"" scene was just cinematic background for one of those psychedelic rock bands on a TV show. Kubrick threw in some good classical music and the cinematography was very well done.

What hides behind the glassy slab composed of the inkiest blackness imaginable? Is the monolith a relic from a long-lost cosmic culture? Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe it serves as a sentinel, an extraterrestrial guardian to evaluate intelligent life, an alien yardstick to measure civilization, to supervise its genesis and progress. Or is it closer to a teacher, providing man with the missing link to what lies beyond, a rung to hold on to, so that a sometimes floundering race may evolve beyond?

It was so good that it left you thinking what the heck is he saying at the end. I read the book and just liked the beginning about the ape who was more contemplative than the others. At the time there was a book out called On Aggression and was interesting and popular because of the Vietnam War. Today this movie is too long for the younger show me now generations. I still think this is the best movie that was ever made about actually encountering alien, super intelligent life.

Thus it was filmed on 70 mm film and in 6 channel stereo which, at the time was a huge thing.

236,2 November 2005,mattdenes,10, The Greatest Movie Of All Time. Period.,"I was lucky enough to be first shown this masterpiece of cinema in my mid-teenage years, thus having a relatively broad mind, and the capacity to extend the limits of thought to understand the message that 2001: A Space Odyssey is telling us. First of all allow me to alleviate the common rumor or nowadays stereotype that this movie is boring. One simple unalienable fact that people must realize is that the differences contrasting between past and modern cinema are unlimited and infinite. The ever-present mood, emphasis and feeling that the 60s and 70s brought into movies is irreplaceable. In those days, if a movie was 2 1/2 hours long, the mindset of movie-goers wasn't ""Oh, this movie must be so packed full of action that the 2 hours will shoot by like lightning."" They were more along the lines of ""Okay, this movie is long, it is an epic, what needs to be said to us cannot be simply accomplished within minutes, things have to happen before grander things can happen, an we are going to be shown virtually every second of it."" The one thing people tend to forget about space and space travel and space technology is that it ISN'T fast. It cannot just happen as if it were on a timer as in the movie atrocity Armageddon. What happens happens at the pace it does to perpetuate the un-deniable fact that this movie, although a work of science fiction, is as realistic as it can be, regardless if it's about the possible futures that lay before us. These days, the audiences have been dumbed down by so-called logic in movies. It must all be explained to them, otherwise they leave confused and angry. Those who honestly dislike 2001 simply do not, or no longer possess the patience, nor the capacity to understand that some truths will NOT be merely dropped into our laps. What makes a fantastic film, the sole characteristic that classifies a movie as brilliant, is the fact that it leaves US to create OUR OWN meanings for why something in a movie is happening. The inner-depths to 2001's meanings range from knowledge of the universe around us, to the inconsistency of evolving technology. The rest is up to us to decipher, after we do that, we can believe what WE think is the true meaning.",

This film has so many mind-blowing visuals, fantastic classical music, phenomenally hidden themes, masterful direction and great storytelling. Directors like Stanley Kubrick have a special place in the history of filmmaking. Kubrick is one of the VERY few directors that delivers an extremely unique presence to ALL of his films with his direction and he also knows what his audience wants out of filmmaking and I absolutely LOVE that! Even if you watch 2001 by 1st viewing and even if you don't fully understand the film, it's SOO unforgettable to step away from and it's due to unforgettable direction, plot, music and breathtakingly GORGEOUS visuals and of course the Apollo moon landing! 2001 also captures an amazing and stunning feel of mankind interfering with something that's unknown and very fascinating and we've had so many films that have portrayed 2001: A Space Odyssey and NONE of them have been able to top this film. One thing that's very interesting about Stanley Kubrick is that he will show you AMAZING and FASCINATING images in all of his films and they absolutely keep you in on edge and focused and that's because all of Kubrick's films have a feel of ""realism"" and 2001: A Space Odyssey is a perfect execution! The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket and Dr. Strangelove along with all of Kubrick's other films have MANY things that make you follow along with their stories and messages and visuals and elements and that's what makes Stanley Kubrick a Master in cinema history! As a person who LOVES cinema and is a nerd when it comes to film, I'm gonna be completely honest when I say that ""In my mind, 2001: A Space Odyssey is the BEST directed movie I've ever seen!"" 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that has stood the test of time HIGHLY successfully with many mind-blowing and unforgettable elements that makes this film a TRUE masterpiece! 2001: A Space Odyssey gets a 10/10!",

253,2 April 2020,baileycrawly,8," ""Open the Pod Bay Doors, HAL""","A lot of people don't like this movie, and putting the label on them stating they just don't ""get it"" really isn't fair. Because a lot of the criticisms against the movie are valid. The lack of dialogue and extended musical/visual scenes are definitely not something the general film-going public nowadays will flock to see (it's an absolute shame, but it's the reality). It truly is a slow-paced movie without much of a plot, too, which a lot of people dislike the film for.
Today, on its fifty-second anniversary, i have finally decided to sit down and view the film from start to finish, and I have to say I'm thoroughly impressed.
This isn't a movie that is designed to be watched like other movies. It's not something you can put on in the background while you're making supper or doing the dishes; this is a film that requires you to both watch and contemplate throughout. The stunning visuals (that held up over the years, I might add) only serve to amplify the beauty in simplicity that Kubrick was going for in this film.
With 2001: A Space Odyssey, you really get out of the movie what you put in. If you're looking for casual entertainment that can provide background noise while you surf your phone, this film will be a major disappointment. If you're looking for some deep plot, you'll also, likewise, be disappointed. George Lucas said it best himself when he explained the plot as being ""razor thin."" It's an extremely basic story told in a very grandiose way. It's pretentious (I don't mind), it's rambling (somehow I ended up enjoying all the extended sequences), and it's unlike anything else, which is both a good and a bad thing. Good in the sense that, aside from being parodied and tributed (not a word) to absolute death, there hasn't really been anything to my knowledge that has come out that felt like an imitation of this film. It's a bad thing because I would definitely have loved for Kubrick to explore this kind of filmmaking a little more in his lifetime.",
254,27 August 2021,zwjonas,5, So Much Wasted Time,This movie is by a landslide the worst film in way of pointless slow-moving non-plot-oriented things being onscreen for what feels like hours. There is not a word spoken for the first 25min of the movie. The film is soo slow and a total drag. Dont waste your time unless you are super patient. Sad to see such an interesting idea and plot boringly drawn out to the fullest longest feeling film with so much wasted time. Most of this film just feels like national geographic for space.,
255,20 June 2003,Eredain,1, The very worst (philosophically speaking),"Everyone who likes this movie for its plot and philosophical content refuses to explain why. Instead, they dish up constructive comments like ""if you don't get it, then I won't bother explaining it to you"". Sophists used to apply such methods in order to make themselves seem wise. They would walk into a room and utter something completely unintelligible. Those who didn't understand it, believed that it had to be their own fault, as the sophists had already established a reputation for themselves. Also, they didn't want to ADMIT that they didn't understand it, as they believed it would make them look foolish. And so, what was in fact devoid of meaning began to be called ""deep"" and the word ""mysterious"" became positively laden. Well, I claim that 2001: A Space Odyssey is empty and meaningless. People have claimed otherwise, but no one has ever EXPLAINED otherwise. And surely the burden of proof must rest with them. Trying to disprove what has never been proven to begin with is a waste of time. It would be like attempting to disprove the existence of the easter bunny.",

Impossible to imagine anyone having a mixed reaction to this one, it seems to polarize audiences like no other. If you totally flip for it, you might choose to give up your friends who hated it. Unpleasant thought, but such is this movie's power. Even its first young ""hippie"" audiences needed weed to get them through it, though the movie itself provides its own hallucinations if you give it the chance.

260,25 November 2007,onepotato2,9, Miraculous,"I love this movie. I give it enormous credit for being one of the earliest (and still rare) movies that cannot be watched without engaging the world of ideas; due to both the subject matter, and the terse style by which Kubrick advances the story. The viewer is asked to make enormous leaps between disparate and often wordless sequences, that don't telegraph meaning overtly. Understanding or enjoying the movie isn't possible if you refuse to be thoughtful or if you're a passive viewer. This was an affront to older audiences (See ""Rock Hudson"") conditioned to believe that entertainment was the first, last and only purpose for movies; and it was a revolution for younger audiences who were ready and willing to explore films potential, and see what was next in the 60s. The movie of ideas, and not the asinine, self-important ""issue"" movie that Hollywood loves to reward, is the highest use for film. Sadly, most movies ask nothing of viewers. Issue movies only ask that you bring your overblown, overvalued morality with you, and reach a conclusion the entire culture already agrees on. Give me a difficult movie that makes some demands.",
261,31 July 2009,HorrorEnjoyer,5," Piece of art, but not that good from a movie standards.","This THING is a piece of art - nothing more, nothing less. But is it a good movie? Or is it even a movie? I don't think so. If you want to watch this you need to prepare your-self like for a trip into an art or any other museum, because if you'll try to watch it like a movie - you'll hate it. It gives you almost none information about the actual story and most of the time you're left guessing. I have never red a book so I had no idea what was going on. Sure, I could appreciate entertaining and well written HAL character but not much else. Most of the time they're just showing you THINGS. Things, that most of the time doesn't really add-up anything to the plot. I'd go even further and say that this movie doesn't have a plot - I can film the sky for two hours it wouldn't make it a movie. I can catch some beautiful things, but if there won't be any narrator to link everything to one piece I'd have no right to tell anyone, that I made ""a movie."" Movie must have well developed plot and characters, there can be some hidden messages, yes, but you simply just can't hide most of the plot from the viewer. So in conclusion I'd like to sum it up - ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" stands fine like a piece of art, but fails in too many regions as a movie to deserve such a big rating on internet MOVIE data base. This isn't meant to be a movie and if you're going to watch it that's the first thing you need to understand.",

267,26 May 2020,dommercaldi,9, Stanley Kubrick Is A Master. That Is All,"Pros:
1. The opening sequence featuring the monkey's, is not only engrossing, but it brilliantly shows how man came to rule using tools, thus setting up a constant theme during the film: evolution and its consequences.
2. The score is both tantalising and iconic. Even when the score chops to induce an ominous atmosphere, it's still hauntingly beautiful.
3. The space set design is incredible. It's not only stunning, but intricately designed.
4. Douglas Rain (HAL 9000) gives a fantastically bone-chilling voice-acting performance, and Keir Dullea (Dr. Dave Bowman) delivers a brilliant performance.
5. The sound design is great and it really heightens the drama, especially when the movie cuts-back to complete silence.
6. The directing and camera-work is stunning. It was clearly precisely planned out.
7. The tension and suspense is built up amazingly via the score, sound design, the long and penetrating close-ups, as well as the acting.
8. The entire ending sequence of Dr. Dave Bowman travelling space and time is utterly enrapturing and well-shot.",

And come to think about that this movie is so praised for being mind-blowing and visually stunning(agree only with the last one). So to quote a reviewer who once said this line: ""Great movies are often those who question the audience"". So what's wrong with this movie? The simple fact that it gives the audiences the answer as if the answer would be that or the other one, not one which we would realize we could not comprehend or realize it exceeds our grasp of understanding the things in our 3 dimensional space. But the question and the complexity of the movie is either missing or hidden so well in order for the ending to shock the viewer. For me personally - because this is a subjective review - I would prefer for the movie to take me somewhere where I would understand that I can't understand... like have a message beyond words or images. Instead this movie spends it's time with nonsensical stuff and doesn't asks me or takes me to that place I might not fully grasp or comprehend but rather shows images of things whose meaning I couldn't understand in the context of the movie.",

272,2 November 2020,kingofdanerds,10, A film that is years ahead of its time,"Stanley Kubrick is often considered to be one of the greatest film makers of all time. I mean, most (if not all) of his films are considered top notch films. 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of those films. Released in 1968, 2001: A Space Odyssey is often considered to be one of the greatest science fiction films of all time and it is not hard to see why. Upon release, the film recieved mixed reviews but has gone on to gain it's reputation as one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. Kubrick wrote the screenplay along with Arthur C. Clarke who also wrote the novel during the film's production with the novel being released shortly after the film was released. Arthur C. Clarke would go on to write the 3 sequels to 2001 with the first of the sequels, 2010, recieving a film adaptation in 1984. 2001: A Space Odyssey recieved four nominations at the Academy Awards and won one for the films special effects.",

Again, read the book first- then you can really appreciate the movie",
274,1 September 2021,mcjensen-05924,1, Another Kubrick Disaster,"Quite simply stated, with a few exceptions, Kubrick doesn't know how to make an interesting or even somewhat coherent movie. The movies he's most famous for, this one included, are immensely dull and meandering messes. There's no transition from scene to scene it just jumps randomly here and there. After the first hour there's several things you will be sick of, likely forever. The sound of monkeys screeching and classical music. The opening sequence goes on forever and serves no real purpose. I eventually muted the volume. When actual people finally show up on screen, they can't act! Looking back there's always at least one person in his movies that displays a shocking lack of talent. Usually in a rather large if not leading role. The dialogue is absurd nonsense, circular and redundant. How was your flight? Good. Oh, that's good. Be good for your mommy. What do you think? I dunno what do you think? Riveting stuff. Yawn.....There's another drawn out scene with two guys eating, which is pretty disgusting but not nearly as gross as the scene in Clockwork Orange. It's nothing but extremely uninteresting people in space who occasionally talk to their extremely uninteresting family members back home. Outer space serves as the setting for what could be the most senseless and confusing piece of pretentious cinematic trash ever created. Why do Kubrick movies end up with over 8 star ratings? It's baffling. He's either butchering someone else's novel or completely misrepresenting some historic event. And just because his approach is original doesn't make it effective or even entertaining. Midway through this movie I found myself not even caring what happened. I just wanted to make sure the remote was close in case another eternal bout of the same music came on again. And let's not forget the scene with the heavy breathing that was more like an obscene phone call than a believable space walk. Repetitiveness is irritating, and any film maker worth his salt should know this. Anyway, the conclusion is just as disappointing as the beginning and the middle. And it never came soon enough!! It's just silly and resolves nothing because we never knew there was anything to be resolved. None of the characters had any personality or history to speak of, who how could we care if they randomly burst into flames or started playing the tuba. Either one of those would be preferrable to seeing them eat another meal. If you want Kubrick that won't annoy too much, try Lolita or Dr. Strangelove. If you were just looking for a good movie set in space, well.....there's not many out there. Alien & Blade Runner are the only ones that come to mind.",

Still, a movie ,where the first words don't happen until roughly 25 minutes into the movie, is making a huge mistake. The plot is incomprehensible.

The cube is the thing that I'm going to talk about. I think it's a symbol of ignorance. It doesn't matter how much we make progress in science because there's always unknowns for human even more than before. How much did monkeys and scientists know about the cube? Which group has more questions? For sure it's scientists who have more questions and more unknowns. The spaceship's style is like a sperm and we can see it better in the last minutes when the spaceship's body could be seen as a sperm like moving light. I think it means that our space Odyssey is like a sperm's journey to the womb. And our knowledge of the world around is as same as a child's knowledge of surroundings in the womb.

After watching this film, Strauss's Blue Danube cannot be listened to without associating it with this film. The same applies to Also sprach Zarathustra, which almost seems it was made to be in this work.
 2001 truly uses every element a perfect film needs. From the first scene, The Dawn of Man, one of the most brilliant film transitions of all time can be found, the transition of a bone to a spaceship. These both are symbols of the evolution of man, from the original tool, to the revolutionary spaceship. The way Kubrick makes time so important is extraordinary completely inspecting and digging into major philosophical questions, like ""What is mankind?"" and ""Why are we here?"" One of the other reasons I applaud Kubrick for, is he doesn't even know the answers. Or at least, he chooses not to share them saying:",
303,23 April 2014,StevePulaski,10, A film that will grow with you,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a rare movie experience, one of mesmerizing visuals, meticulous craft, full of valuable interpretations, and a work to stand the test of time. Even as computer-generated imagery (CGI) has given animation, action films, and fantasy pictures an antiseptic sleekness and a practical way to showcase certain unforeseen sequences as if they could really happen, films like Star Trek: A Motion Picture, its corresponding TV series, and 2001: A Space Odyssey existed in a time where amateurish special effects where what was predominately available. Director Stanley Kubrick and the studio of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), however, found sources to provide beautiful and limitless cinematography and special effects work in order to bring space into theaters all over the world. This achievement alone is enough to warrant 2001's placement amongst some of the most important films of all time.",

Sure I like OST, not only classic music that has been used but the choir oddball singing and some ambient too. There is great photography from time to time.
BUT
It is slow, unreasonably slow. I have nothing against log shots, slowpaced drama and everything tangential. But here we see how and astronaut works in silence, only his breath is hearable. Do we need to hear his breath? Do we need to watch for half of the movie how the astronauts work, as some documentary?
WELL
The plot with AI rebel is interesting, but so thin-layered... It could be resolved so much faster.
And the opening scene of space missions is good. You see ""picturephone"" all the futuristic ideas, but the imagination stopped right there, no more gadgets or robots or something representing future electronics.
SO
Who would have thought that the best part of the movie is ""The Dawn of Humanity"", or whatever it is called. It has drama, it has action, it has mystery... and well, it is fun to watch. Other 1.5 hours is pretentious pointless time consumption.

Well, as is the case with the majority of great movies, 2001 spawns thinking and discussion. A movie that answers all of its questions neatly and in a timely manner can rarely be anything more than something to watch to kill a couple of hours. But 2001 is so creative and so mysterious that you really have to think about it and even watch it a few times over before you can begin to come up with a coherent meaning from it. This is a science fiction film for the thinking audience, as opposed to the fast food schlock that is cranked out by Hollywood (Mission To Mars, Pitch Black, Supernova, Armageddon, and other such nonsense), but with the obvious exception of the excellent Apollo 13.

Unlike almost every other science fiction film before or since, Kubrick chooses to play it slow, building an atmosphere instead of spoiling us with action: spaceships (presumably plastic models, in an age preceding computer-made effects) dance ballets while the phenomenon of zero-gravity is represented in a manner that would surely have been familiar to M. C. Escher.  With immense audacity, Kubrick allows  us almost no dialogue for the first half an hour (except for a few words spoken by, of all people, Leonard Rossiter!); and throughout the film, he conspires masterfully against his audience, daring to keep us in the dark about what is really going on.  It does have to be said that the ending inspires David Lynch style misgivings (the final revelation is only that there is no resolution); but as with a Lynch film, this film transcends the logical purpose of plot.",

When I finished watching this film a few days ago I decided to see what the IMDb reviewers thought of it, and, unsurprisingly, opinion was split between those who hailed it as a masterpiece worthy of consideration alongside 'Citizen Kane' and 'Gone with the Wind', and those who thought that it was a disastrous, pretentious wreck. Although I was somewhat sceptical at certain points in the film (particularly the lengthy silent moments), I have to plant my feet alongside the crowd who praise Kubrick's genius in making '2001'. This title is more a sensory experience than a movie, and so it's tremendously difficult to convey what you should expect; but, at some point throughout the film, something will click into place. That sounds horribly vague, but I can't help but compare it to one of those computer-based optical illusions which instruct the reader to ""stare at 'x' and within 30 seconds you'll see 'y'."" This film conveys its themes and philosophy in an abstract but not incomprehensible way, and although it may slot into the 'sci-fi' category, it's much more than that. When it comes to Stanley Kubrick films, I think I'll always hold 'A Clockwork Orange' in the highest regard due to its style and excellent lead, but I really believe that '2001' is the director's magnum opus.",

My favorite part (although I used to hate it) is the ""Dawn of Man"" sequence. The African photography is beautiful, and the apes (australopithecus?) are so convincing it's hard to believe they're really actors in ape suits. The acting in this movie is often underrated; Keir Dullea's boyish good looks and calm, reassuring demeanor bring to mind real-life astronauts such as John Glenn and Neil Armstrong, and William Sylvester is perfect as the glad-handing bureaucrat Dr. Heywood Floyd. I think Kubrick meant for the film to be enjoyed as a visual experience rather than analyzed for any deeper meaning, but for what it's worth, I see it as a Buddhist(or possibly Hindu) myth of birth, death, and rebirth.

Mr Arthur C.Clarke's ""The Sentinel"" was written 60 years ago.At that time the only rockets were adaptations of Herr von Braun's V2 which,3 or 4 years earlier had the sole modest - if deadly - ambition of clawing its way high enough into the sky to drop on London. By the time Mr Kubrick was considering making ""2001"",the Apollo space programme was well under way.Of the two Mr Clarke's vision was the more imaginative and percipient. Certainly ""2001"" is a remarkable movie by any standards,perhaps,along with the vastly different ""Alien"",at the very peak of the Sci - Fi pantheon.Mr Scott's masterwork,made 11 years later,shows space travel as routine,boring and a little grubby,in complete contrast to Mr Kubrick's concept of it as a new and exciting step in freeing Mankind from the confines of Earth. Furthermore,the Clarke/Kubrick collaboration reaches far wider,no less than the elevation of Man to the next step in the evolutionary scale. Having performed some Herculean tasks the surviving astronaut is finally reborn as a""Starchild"" thus marking the beginning of a new journey for the species. Generations of moviegoers have grown up whose only knowledge of the movie is via the video or more lately,DVD.However grand their Home Cinema equipment may be it can only give them a very limited idea of the magnificence of the original visuals and the almost overpowering soundtrack.Occasionally you can catch a theatrical production and I most strongly urge you to do so if possible.Only then can you appreciate the impact the movie had on my generation forty years ago.

We must always take into account the time when they were produced, their implicit and explicit intentions and absorb what is good and reflect on its content for our lives. One of the film's screenwriters alongside Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, once said: ""If someone understands 2001 at first, we will have failed. We wanted to raise many more questions than answer them"" and at another point said that the goal his and Kubrick's, when doing ""2001"", was to force the audience to reflect on an extraordinary number of questions.
One of the factors that most marked and left the film as ""untouchable"" today was the anticipation of facts by showing in a flash worthy of great visionaries, the arrival of man on the Moon more than a year before Neil Armstrong arrived until there, giving the audience even an image of the planet Earth straight from space without any image being possible even before the arrival of man on the moon. Kubrick's view of the Earth is very similar to that we have today, with just a lot more water and little land representing the continents. In 1968, it also managed to raise the hypothesis of artificial intelligence and other technological advances such as automatic doors, voice identifiers, telephone calls between space and Earth, upside-down movements, etc. If today, more than usual, it is already outdated, imagine it all in the late 60s.",

The space station segments - they are one of the only moments in the film with extensive dialogue. The ""futuristic"" suits are laughably '60s-ish and some of the ideas in the movie about communication via video, etc. Are ludicrous. That happens in any movie after a certain amount of time, but ""2001"" almost entirely depends upon this. I feel the actual story itself is weak.

350,7 October 2015,kristian_cooper,10," phenomenal, groundbreaking a masterpiece.","A culturally significant masterpiece of its time. 2001 A space odyssey is quite possibly the greatest science fiction film (and book) of all time. When people mention the notion of space travel in film this movie arguably one of the greatest of the 20th century always springs to mind. Just the ideas and themes presented in this film are truly ground-breaking. Before we had Gravity, interstellar, star wars, we had 2001, the film that started it all. From the dawn of time sequence where the film begins we soon witness one of the most awkward plot changes in cinematic history. Suddenly we are thrust into outer space, into the modern era witnessing a spacecraft descending into a space station and we soon witness a group of astronauts on a journey to the planet Jupiter. Kubrick's attention to detail and predictions of future technologies were simply spot on. The video phone in the space station, recognise that? It's what we now know as Skype. There doesn't have to be a lot of dialogue for one to understand the very notion of what is happening during the film in fact at least half an hour of the film there is no dialogue whatsoever. I wouldn't even consider there to be a lead actor in the film, in actual fact the central character in this film happens to be an artificial intelligent being known as the ""HAL-9000"", the central computer that helps the crew control their ship en route to Jupiter. 2001 A space Odyssey set the benchmark for idea of 'Man Vs Machine' and these ideas were later evident in future works such as Bladerunner and Bicentennial man. Also we must remember this film was released before the days of flashy CGI style special effects yet the way Kubrick gave you the sensation of being in outer space was just awe inspiring. Not to mention quite possibly one of the most spectacular uses of Strauss's music in cinematic history. This film does everything a science fiction film should. It also was the first film to get all of the science behind space travel accurate. So if you haven't already done so, do yourself a favour and watch this groundbreaking, phenomenal film.",

Rather than being a film, 2001 is a thrillingly ambitious visual journey that transcends time and space, bringing forth puzzling, yet provocative ideas of the beauty and horror in mankind's quest to further itself as a species. It is an experience that refuses to spoon-feed its themes, opening the intellectual playing field for multiple interpretations, creating a swarm of controversy and argument as each individual seeks to piece together the subtle and not-so-subtle hints at what in the world 2001 is saying.

A question about it is whether those evolutional leaps are inherent in the process of evolution, i.e. driven by internal evolutional forces, or they are driven by some certain external forces. In this movie Kubrick and Clarke take the second hypothesis (But, of course, it doesn't automatically mean that they really think so).

375,5 March 2019,vpmzisi,1, A Cure for Insomnia,"This has to be, without a doubt, the single most boring atrocity ever to grace the silver screen. I first had the misfortune of watching this film several years ago, when someone I knew forced me to see it, telling me it was one of the greatest films of all time. Ha! They couldn't be further from the truth! So what are its problems? The pace, for one thing. There are extended periods where people move slowly, and everything is quiet. This is an attempt to be scientifically accurate (it's in space, after all), but there is far too much of this in the film--all the great filmmakers have techniques of briefly illustrating effects like this for you, then moving on with the story. The other annoyance is how the film keeps cutting back to shots of animals. I remember the scene where the monkeys are playing with the bones. An absurd shot that's not very interesting at all. About the only thing about the film that's any good is the music, and by that, I am just referring to the Strauss pieces (Richard and Johann). Which, if I were either of those men, I'd sue the makers of this movie. Kubrick is probably the worst director of all time, and after being forced to sit through this one, I look forward to never seeing one of his films again, as long as I live!
I should say this film does have one redeeming quality. If you have trouble sleeping, this is the cure you've been waiting for!",

It raises questions like ""Are we giving machines too much information?"" ""Is technology going at a rate where human beings will be replaced by machines?"" ""What was up with the last 20 minutes?"" Well, Stanley Kubrick was very good at making you think about these things. His ability to draw you into the suspense is shown here. His artistic ability is shown here. His message is shown here. And his ability to end a movie without any of the questions shown above is shown here. It's sort of like an experience movie, especially during the end. So here's the plot. A space mission showcases the work of Dr. Frank Poole, and Dr. Dave Bowman. They are helped by the computer HAL 9000. HAL eventually realizes that Dave and Frank are planning too disconnect him so he eliminates Frank but not Dave. Dave saves himself from being killed by disconnecting HAL. It's sort of like a film in 4 parts. Part 1 is the part with the apes. Part 2 is the part with the moon mission. Part 3 is the part with Dave, Frank, and HAL. Part 4 is the part with the portal.

383,19 May 2016,benatarandres,10, Think Things Over.,"What are we? It's a strange question at first and not the kind you usually ask. Yet people like Carl Sagan and Richard Feynman asked this question numerous times in their careers. They posed it with humility and reason, never making up answers, and assuming that everything that science had come up with was wrong. In an interview where Feynman was asked about the certainty pertaining to the scientific method, he expressed his view, being that of a Cartesian, and how he would rather be filled with doubt, than to have answers that could possibly be wrong. Its noble and it entails the integrity of a curious mind who believes in the beauty of investigating and discovering, rather than basing your conclusion on little or no evidence. 2001: A Space Odyssey does not provide answers, but it gives us insights into what the human race is, posing even greater questions to the potential we hold as self-conscious beings. 2001 is significantly different from the usual science fiction film. Although it poses the usual question's pertaining to the uniqueness of our species, the existence of God, and the direction we are heading in our progressivism, it rarely goes beyond a few simple lines of dialogue. The few characters, mostly being astronauts and a few Hominids, utter very few words as the story progresses from the dawn of humankind, to the evolutionary stage of space exploration. But then again, it's those very moments that simply play out as naturalistic as possible that truly define the story, as the images of objects floating in space, with ""On the Beautiful Blue Danube"" playing in the background that we truly come to be in sync with the spirit of the film. This spirit is mysterious, and although we still don't understand what it is, or where it came from. But the search becomes all the more invigorating as we challenge both our intellectual and explorative capacities, thus gaining a greater understanding of the human spirit. When human kind was still developing, our awareness was at a minimal state of ambiguity, never truly grasping the significance of any particular action, relying purely on instinct. A scene where a group of Hominids stumble upon a monolith, shows them react with wild and almost chaotic rage at the sight. Not too long after, they learn to kill enemy combatants for land. As our ancestor raises the bone and begins to shatter various bones on the ground, the shot is given a particular focus as it entails the essence of discovery in the most primitive standards. When at the peaking point of our development, we are more casually reliant on ungodly technological advances, endowing them with their own conscious awareness that merely gives greater reason to ponder the definition of intelligence. The Hal 9000, an artificial intelligence unit claims its inability to commit error, already symbolizing the very arrogance that defines our own self-indulged obligation to intellectual superiority. Hal's devotion to intelligence although admirable, is clouded with pride to the degree that it mirrors our own fear of death and failure in the face of the inevitable. Human beings, although the most intelligent creatures known so far, classify themselves as intelligent. Yet, with what little we still don't know about the Universe, there could be life elsewhere in the Universe, probably vastly more intelligent than we are. Our modern day Carl Sagan, or Stephen Hawking, as daunting as their intellects are to the average individual, could merely pose as amateurs to intelligent alien life, depending on their own conception of intelligence. The discussion to intelligence is central to the theme of this film, for it pertains with our own approach towards our ever growing desire to ascend and evolve. The film's episodic pattern of storytelling introduces a black monolith in each chapter. There are some speculations regarding these monoliths, and at times they drive the characters, be it the hominids, or the astronauts to further questioning their origins. The beliefs are focused around the notion of an extraterrestrial species. Their intentions, although never clear, are more viewed in the concepts of overseers to the universe. With 2001, being based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel of the same name, the origin of the multiple Monolith's gives little if any detail to their conception, Only the fact that they are of nonhuman origin, that there is some understanding of their descent, but little of their purpose. 2001: A Space Odyssey is something to wonder, for it is the sort of film that although gives very little answers, it raises the kinds of questions which have driven us from the jungles of Africa to the infinite realm of Space, in our quest for knowledge and understanding. Stanley Kubrick's vision of the human capacity for knowledge is an enlightening and extraordinary attempt as his classic space epic, through long shots of the soundless and weightless space, combined with J Strauss's ""On the Beautiful Blue Danube"", there comes a more poetic feeling of the beautiful and mysterious Cosmos we still hope to understand in our gradual evolutionary development. 2001 is a landmark of discovery, and even inspiring to the degree that it is spiritual and Godly in its essence. When touching on God, I don't mean a sentient being outside the universe, but more towards Arthur C. Clarke's definition, which pertains towards knowledge and the path that encompasses its essence as human kind still strives with the enthusiasm that drives the very curiosity that define people like Richard Feynman in their quest for understanding. Feynman once said, ""When you doubt and ask, it gets a little harder to believe"", and although this clarifies the difficult journey humanity embarks on every day when learning, it's the first and necessary step to arriving at a more honorable degree of knowledge.",

I was taken to this film as a child in one of its 70's revival theatre showings (it was one of my parents' favourite films) and I can't really remember what I made of it then, but this film has been there with me at different stages of my life (like the monolith in the film at different stages of evolution) and probably always will be.",

Along this epic voyage of time and space, we watch the birth of human technology and its push towards the evolution of our species, ultimately leading to an envisioned modern era of dazzling discoveries.

Also, just a warning, if you don't like breathing noises, get as far away as you can from this movie and anyone who likes it, or just skip it. The movie has long sequences lingering on the same object or area for long periods, never ending scenes in both a meditative and annoying way. The ending is absolutely head scratching.

Oh yes, the special effects are good, some of the ideas in the movie are good - but the movie fails because it is utterly boring, drowning in Kubrick's own self obsession. People go on and on about the technical minutiae - like that's genius - to show the boring bits everyone else edits out - BECAUSE THEY'RE BORING! 2001 is 20 minutes of a good film stretched out over 3 hours! I am an avid reader and watcher of sci-fi. I love the genre because it provokes you to think. This movie was not thought-provoking, but sleep inducing, and caused me not to ponder the human condition, but instead how Kubrick got away with producing the navel-gazing piece of self-adulation. It practically cries out ""look at me! look how clever I am! I can do things no one else does and get away with it because I am clever!""

That being said, I have nothing but respect for a movie with a fair amount of ingenuity and thought provoking ideas being crafted back in 1968. I was amazed and intrigued by a lot of the scenes as to how they did it - with what looked like just camera work. However, because of that negative mindset(as before mentioned), some scenes became horridly outdrawn ranging from sometimes five to fifteen minutes of random assaults of either complete silence or static/strange sounds. Instead of enjoying the obvious attempt to create suspense and atmosphere, it instead became a strenuous struggle on my poor head-phoned-ears. ",

However, late last year, I rewatched it again with my dad and this time, I came to see it for what it is. From its thought-provoking themes and lavish visuals to it's acting and captivating musical score, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a triumph of not only filmmaking but also of visual storytelling.

Some may argue that it is the best work Kubrick has done. It's intense and captivating, and it's less than 1/3 of the running length. This is a structurally odd film. We are treated to a number of sequences that seem almost self-contained and then the film ends almost inexplicable with a scene of grace and beauty but only in a complete non-substantial sense. Basically, the majority of the film, which encapsulates on both ends the segment, is extremely pretty and amazingly conceived sequences of music and imagery without meaning or purpose that fail to captivate beyond their own visual and auditory beauty.

Then one morning, they awaken to the presence in their midst of a 4-meter-high monolith of unknown origin and purpose. The monolith subtly alters their behavior, leading them to the concept of tool use, by which they defeat a rival band. Violence assures survival. Jump forward to the year 2001. There are two bases on the Moon, one American and one Soviet. In the course of a magnetometric lunar survey, Americans scientists discover a large magnetic anomaly below the surface of the crater Tycho. When excavated, it turns out to be---you guessed it---a monolith, just like the one that, unbeknownst to the Americans, appeared on Earth four million years before. Except for a single, extremely powerful, radio transmission aimed at Jupiter, the monolith remains completely inert, its composition, origin and purpose a total mystery. The Americans undertake a mission to Jupiter. The spaceship Discovery carries the pilot, Dave Bowman, the copilot, Frank Poole, and the 3-man survey team, who are in cryosleep for most of the voyage. The Discovery is run by a powerful supercomputer, an HAL 9000, known as ""Hal."" Only Hal knows the true mission objective, and the conflict between his instructions to provide totally correct service and his instructions to keep the mission objective secret from the crew causes him to go ""insane."" He attempts to kill everyone in the crew, but Bowman manages to survive and to disable Hal while still keeping the Discovery functional. Bowman reaches Jupiter space and discovers a huge monolith orbiting the planet, identical to the one on the Moon only much larger. He approaches the monolith in one of Discovery's EVA pods, and discovers that it is a Stargate. He is swept across unimaginable distances and then undergoes a transformation into the next stage of human evolution, a Star Child.",

Is he truly God's greatest creation or is he just a tiny hopeless organism in one of infinite inhabited planets? That's what makes this film a landmark in motion picture history. And the special effects are absolutely astonishing. Many people criticize it for being slow, poorly edited and boring, thinking that playing it at 2X speed would improve it, and, in a way, they're right.

The amount of attention to detail is staggering in this movie, but the feel is still best described as lazy - leisurely and for the most part banal. This is completely intentional on the part of Stanley Kubrick, of course.)

441,14 June 2018,samyaksambuddha,9, Technological classic with a judicious mix of philosophy,"Now, this comes with a change. The casting, screening and acting is of a different yet interesting tone. This is not an action packed space movie with superflous wars and ships rather an insight into the actual working of the space crew and the issues they face. The movie centres around finding the source of the monolith that is said to be the harbinger of evolution of humankind. Various missions are send to Moon, Jupiter for understanding the genesis but all turns out futile.
In the detailing part the movie shows the way the voyages work and the practical ways of working and problems faced by the crew members yet subordinated for the media sake. The movie turns upside down when the conflict arises with the 6th member (the supercomputer) which is at the brain of the ship. The conflict leads to victimization of the crew members with one of the them (Bowman) struggling against the AI. He finds a way into the ship somehow to deactivate the computer. 
The movie has many philosophical dimensions probably aimed at explaining the limited resources and intelligence of the human in understanding the deep secrets of the universe. It is likely that the movie outlines the depth of formation of universe and that man is still small whatever small accomplishments it may have made.

These are some great special effects, even for now. It seems as though Kubrick's whole reason for making this was to capture the beauty of classical music being played to long scenes of interesting space sets and special effects. While it was very interesting for it's time, it's lost some pizazz now that every movie has this. However the part of the film that is still really interesting today is the Dawn of Man opening segment where man's ape like descendent's learn how to commit violence. It's amazing how ape like they actually got these creatures to look, while still having a weird human like quality to them. The biggest story in the film was a spaceship's extremely intelligent computer Hal is taking over the ship. It's an interesting plot, but one that doesn't kick in until late in to the film. The main problems with this movie are it's lack of a real central plot and no explanation for many supernatural things that happen, but nonetheless, this is still a classic for many reasons, but even a classic can be flawed.",

446,13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,10," The Slow, Cosmic Ballet","There is no question what Stanley Kubrick is looking for in 2001: man is insignificant. Space is vast, space is monotonous, and humans are insignificant because we cannot comprehend the vastness that is space. This space movie begins on Earth, before man had inherited it, when mankind was still toiling in the form of hapless primates, barely surviving and not at the top of the food chain. Then it happened. What exactly? We don't know, but something from above, in the form of a black monolith, helps the primates become man. Zip ahead a couple of thousand of years (literally, cut from prehistoric Earth to the space age is unofficially the biggest jump in time in movie history) and we find man living in space. One of the most famous, and beautiful scenes, of the movie is the ballet between a space ship and the spinning Hilton Hotel orbiting the Earth to the classical song ""On Blue Danube."" The music suggests grace and elegance in space travel, but the action and dialog suggest slow, tedious, boring work. This might as well be a silent movie, the most interesting dialog comes from a taped BBC interview that appears halfway through the movie. The character with the most speaking may be the computer that runs a ship that is headed towards Jupiter, on a mission to investigate another monolith. The infamous HAL 9000, voted as one of movies best villains, is not really a villain, just a confused cyborg. The computer is in charge of two living, breathing scientist and 3 who are hibernating. There is action, but not in the usual sense of science fiction action. There are no lasers, nothing blows up, just slow, problem solving. What happens at the end of the movie is open to interpretation, and that's the fun of the movie. What one of the astronauts goes through when he finds another monolith orbiting Jupiter is up to the viewer. Whatever you think happens, it is important to remember that we as humans look for answers, but in this universe, maybe we aren't supposed to have all of them. This is not a movie to be taken literally, everything is symbolic. There are no wasted shots, no teases, nothing extraneous. It's up to the audience to figure out, to answer one famous question, ""what the hell just happened.""",

The obvious themes here of human evolution and Ai are incredible topics to experience from a late sixties point of view, but it's the dialog and lack thereof that make this film one of the best ever. The music, the special effects and the cinematography are all great. In fact there really isn't anything negative anybody can say about 2001 except for the fact that it's weird. It's not your standard plot with progressive nature of storytelling. It jumps around spatially and temporally. It's a treat to experience because even though it's complicated, it's not convoluted. 2001 is a perfect movie to start off with if you were to start a film club. Have a group of friends together some Sunday afternoon and watch the film check that, make it a Saturday afternoon because you're going to end up spending the entire evening debating about what it all means; especially the final scene. 2001 is my favorite Kubrick film and it's always a must see, no matter how many times I've seen it.",

This then moves to ""The Dawn of Man"" where a tribe of prehistoric apes/primates engaging in regular activities, before finding the black rectangular monolith and learning to use bones as weapons.

After the lone survivor Dave (Keir Dullea) has got into HAL's central core, and killed him, he is taken through Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite, i.e. a colourful vortex before finding his own self ageing before the monolith, and becoming the ""Star Child"".

I have seen ""2001"" many times since that first riveting, obviously unforgettable, experience, and I marvel at how the film holds up, even in terms of its special effects, especially considering its 1968 birth.  I have to admit the initial ""ape"" scenes have paled a bit, but they are thankfully a brief intro to the film, and the film still soars for me from the moment the final ""ape"" throws the bone into the air and it turns into a space ship, floating in the heavens.  For new viewers, though, keep in mind that director Stanley Kubrick intended ""2001"" to be a VERY visual experience, and it is a much lesser experience on a small TV screen (or even a big-screen TV, for that matter).  Try to make your first experience one in a movie theatre--keep in mind that it is being re-released this fall of 2001 in theatres around the world.  I encourage you to make the effort to see it on a big theatre screen--you won't be disappointed.  ""2001"" turned me on to film as an art form, and film as a potentially life-changing experience, and I've been hooked ever since.  Kubrick continued to fascinate me with his films through the years right up to his death, mesmerizing me with ""Eyes Wide Shut"" just before his passing.  I am wary that the project he was working on at his death, ""AI,"" is being made by Steven Spielberg, as I would've loved to have seen Kubrick's interpretation of it.  I will undoubtedly see the Spielberg version, but will be thinking of Kubrick while watching.  I have always thought of Kubrick's films as an acquired taste, and was careful who I recommended them to, so it always amazed me when any of them were commercially successful.  It's especially heartening to see ""2001"" embraced now continuously through the years as one of the best films of all time--since many of us felt pretty lonely back then defending it. It was a love/hate reaction for many back then.  In closing:  Thanks, Mr. Kubrick, wherever you are!  In the spirit of ""2001,"" I hope you're a peaceful and all-knowing ""Star Child"" now that you've passed on to whatever's next.",

This movie is very interesting and Stanley Kubrick did a very good job adapting this movie from a short story, he was able to make this movie almost three hours long and most of it feels pretty surreal. The idea of going through time and space is something that is always discussed about, but this movie portrays it in a realistic manner, almost as if it something that could actually happen.

I found it incredibly hard to patient wait for the slow scenes to end, like the half hour of apes, the 15 minutes of watching the little pod move around in space.

It is light years ahead of anything at that time. It was light on dialog but what it eschewed of dialog it compensated with visual stimuli. There wasn't a single word uttered for the first 30 minutes nor the last 30 minutes thereby leaving a lot open for interpretation. I can't say that I was a fan of the two extremes of the film but I loved the middle. That's not to say I was looking for a plot to be spoon fed to me, it's just that some artsy filmography I like and some I don't.

I have never seen a film with such amazing vision.  Everything in it seems so incredibly well and completely though out.  Kubrick is, no question, the bravest director I've ever seen. What other director would have an overture, intermission, entre'acte and exit music now?  The space sequences are truly silent, whereas Armageddon, for example, fills it with useless noise.  It gives the real feeling of a void, a vacuum, of emptiness and infinity itself.  2001 is a visual opera. It tests the limits of cinema and the very imagination.  I have never seen another movie that required real existential discussion afterwards.  This movie, though it is over 30 years old, has the greatest special effects of any ever.  The ending sequence may be the greatest 20 minutes ever captured on film.  The title is perfect: ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite.""  How it was done is beyond me.

Hard to sum up the plot in one sentence; basically, the interactions/evolution of humanity as influenced by an alien civilization through an artifact known as the Monolith. Watching this is completely different from watching any other movie; there is only a very thin 'overt' plot to tie each of the scenes together, and the acting is muted. To enjoy this movie this time around, I basically tried to look at it like a painting; something to be looked at and appreciated as a work of art. That made it a much more enjoyable experience than if I had tried watching it for a 'story'. To say that the cinematography and special effects are 'great' is almost insulting; not only do these scenes from 1968 still hold up today, but they blow most modern shots out of the water. Every frame is a painting, all set to music that is either beautiful or tense.

Are we alone in the After all this boundless world? But no matter how much we may think, We can not answer these questions. Arthur C. Clarke (author of the script together Stanley Kubrick) said after the premiere: ""If you have managed fully understand the ""Odyssey"", then it is a failure, because we tried to us give a lot more questions than answers.

These themes were able to grant me a more accepting view on the film. As for the more materialistic parts of the film, the visual effects are utterly magnificent.

539,11 March 2017,charlesem,9, The future is never what it's cracked up to be,"I know that I first saw 2001 on April 13, 1968, because that (as a little Googling tells me) was the date of the lunar eclipse I witnessed on leaving the theater in Boston, an appropriately cosmic climax to the cinematic experience I had just had. Kubrick's film was an experience to be savored by those of us who were already hip to the revolution in American filmmaking underway after the sensation of Bonnie and Clyde (Arthur Penn, 1967) and The Graduate (Mike Nichols, 1967). I doubt that anyone who wasn't of an age to experience it realizes quite how revolutionary those movies seemed to us. Though it's conventional to say that our experiences were produced in part by controlled substances, anyone who really knows me knows that I wasn't under the influence of any substance stronger than beer. Today, 2001 doesn't seem much like a revolutionary film: We have lived through the actual 2001, which had its own epoch- making event in the September of that year, but in which no one was making trips to the moon on Pan Am. That airline went out of business in 1991, and the last real moon expedition, Apollo 17, took place in December 1972. But the future is never quite what it's cracked up to be. What was revolutionary about 2001 the movie is that it taught us how a movie can make us think without spelling out its ideas for us. Kubrick wisely whittled down the narrative given him by Arthur C. Clarke to a series of images, and ditched the score written by Alex North for an evocative set of snippets from classical works, letting us assemble any meaning to be derived from the film for ourselves. Of course, in 1968 we went back to our apartments and dorm rooms and did just that. Seeing it today, I am most struck by how skillful Kubrick was in creating the persona of HAL, the sentient computer. Much credit goes, of course, to the voice- over work of Douglas Rain, but also to Kubrick's choice to make the dialogue of the humans in the movie as banal and jargon-filled as possible. HAL's final pleading and breakdown as Dave (Keir Dullea) pulls his memory chips is haunting. Yes, the movie has its longueurs: Kubrick is deservedly proud of its landmark special effects and spends more time than is necessary showing them off. They won him the film's only Oscar, without honoring the work of Douglas Trumbull and others who executed them. He was also nominated as director and as co-screenwriter with Clarke, and the art direction team received a nod, but the film was passed over for the significant work of cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth, who was assisted by John Alcott, and for the sound crew headed by Winston Ryder. And it failed to receive a best picture nomination in the year when that award went to Oliver! (Carol Reed, 1968). I happen to like Oliver! and don't think it's necessarily one of the Academy's more shameful choices, but it's certainly not an epochal movie. (charlesmatthews.blogspot.com)",

FOr the real word on this film, see David Thompson's 'New Bibliographical Dictionary of Film', the essay on Kubric contains my general sentiments about the man and his whole misbegotten oeuvre although his assertions are more eloquently put than what I can muster. Kubric basically conflates sheer lugubrious (read: deadeningly slow) length of film  with 'depth'(of meaning). He is more concerned with the perfection, exactness and pioneering of lenses, focal lengths and shots than with the necessary concerns for character or coherent narrative. His films are vacuous, he is myopic in his views and this film is the most overrated rubbish this side of creation.",

As for Arthur C. Clarke I have been a big fan of his since I read his Rama novels (anyone whose never heard of them or never read them I highly recommend you do so immediately).  Coupled with the fact this is supposedly an epic and one of the best films ever made meant I was determined to see it but somehow never got round to it.  Well I eventually watched it today and I have to ask what was the point?  I kind of got the idea of what was going on but found the whole thing pointless.  From the apes at the beginning (the most drawn out boring piece of cinema in history) to the whole idea of the monoliths just utterly bored me senseless.  Don't get the idea that I'm an action addict and too shallow to enjoy a thought provoking film, I love something I can get my head round but this was just awful.  As for the special effects I find it hard to believe Kubrick was not on LSD when he made this it's just absolutely ridiculous.  In future if I want a sci-fi film I'll stick to the likes of The Matrix, Minority Report or my all time favourite The Abyss.  If I want thought provoking cinema I'll stick with The Shawshank Redemption , Road To Perdition or even The Green Mile.  Each to their own opinion though this is just mine.",

I am in a small minority of film savvy people who believe that Kubrick's use of time represents a self-indulgence matched only by Terence Malick. Watching anything Kubrick made after ""Paths of Glory"" is akin to watching paint dry, including ""Full Metal Jacket"" and (to a lesser extent) ""The Shining"". Think of ""Barry Lyndon"" . . .

This is a pretentious film admittedly, and some will find it dull. That's absolutely fine. This is a classic, but one not everyone will enjoy. With its long running time, lack of narrative coherence and dialogue and refusal to give answers, why is 2001 regarded as one of the best films ever made? Because it is one of the best displays of the power of the cinematic medium ever created and it is an extremely deep movie, with a multitude of interpretations and explanations. It's a cinematic master at the absolute peak of his power; with unforgettable, hypnotic, almost hallucinatory imagery which takes us into straight into the abyss, combined with hauntingly powerful themes which question mankind's place in the universe and effective sound, this is what cinema was made for.",

For 1968, there is no doubt that '2001' set some high bars for sci-fi in film, but watching today with the passage of four decades, there is a lot that works against it's being the monumental must see that it was when first released. I'm thinking about the extended opening with the ape tribes, and the long psychedelic sequence near the finale that certainly wowed audiences back in the day.

Its like Kubrik discovered a bunch of ape suits in the props department and couldn't get enough of photographing them. The numerous screen blackouts and the accompanying sounds are so annoying, so much so that they make the audience lose interest. It looks and feels like Kubrik is seeking artistic indulgence; ie we would allow him any quirks. The heavy breathing by the astronauts that goes on and on and on. I guess in the late 60's that would seem compelling but 50 years later? Nothing more than a boring flick.",

It would be one thing if the movie had no point but to take such a long time to say nothing is painful at best. The whole end scene with the guy seeing himself, and then becoming himself is just plain stupid. In regards to quality, it is a drawn-out student film.

That doesn't mean that reading the book before hand will guarantee that you enjoy the movie, though, as I read the book, knew what was happening in the movie, and still found the movie to be awful.  I admit, however, that the film was creative and was a new experiment in filmmaking; unfortunately, that experiment failed.  It is one of those movies that seems like it should be good just because of its inventiveness and its supposedly ""masterful"" director.

HALs reasoning was completely justified, the two characters were going to disconnect him and this it's as though HAL feels betrayed, and switches to survival mode, just like an instinctive human response. Secondly, the Star Child, having the main character placed in a lab etc etc, very peculiar but intriguing nonetheless.

573,19 July 2010,blackmamba99971,10, Instant most popular movie,"This is quite the ultimate classic science fiction film. 2001 at the time was in fact ahead of its time from the master Stanley Kubrik. Using sounds and music which gives a kind of ballet in space. Orchestral soundtrack using Bach and Strauss was ingenious of showing us the deliberate way of matching the movements of ships that coincide with each track. Including the eerie sounds from the Monolith when Floyd reaches the dig site on the moon. The special effects from Douglas Trumbull was quite possibly the pinnacle of what movie making really is, which led Trumbull on to films such as Close encounters of the third kind, and his very own film - Brainstorm. The idea of showing man in his early stages of evolution to the present was wonderful. Adapting to their surroundings, with the help of the Monolith that just appears one sudden morning as the tribe had begun to awaken from a daily sleep. The same haunting sounds from what people can see is that the Monolith is a type of teaching tool, that embeds signals inside the human mind, yet without actually interfering on how it involves on how the tribe goes on living. Questions of our role in life had started because of Kubrik's influence in this film. And using the Hal 9000 computer shows us that no one is infallible to mistakes. This is by far the most important film to date, which holds many attributable factors to those who also make science fiction films. The sets and designs were hand made, no computer technology was involved in creating this awe and inspiring movie. Excellent to watch on those off days from work.",

Perhaps psychologists can see imagery that I don't care about - but - it is silly at best - very boring at worst. If they going to use electricity - at least use it on something worthwhile. It takes forever to get through some scenes to prove some silly point - maybe giving apes some intelligence. But - what's the point. The Monolith and its meaning are too esoteric for most audiences - it is just sheer cartoonish. I gave this a 2 rating - which is way more than it deserves.

In fact, the production value could pass for today, however there is no way a movie in this day and age would be allowed to run amok with super-long, super-slow scenes if it wants to keep its viewers' attention.

The switch from the flying bone to the space shuttle is a really good way of showing that it all started with the ability to use tools. This technological progress is what a lot of 2001 is about.

586,14 May 2018,hannahgrahambell,7, Deserves its status as a classic,"2001: A Space Odyssey is objectively a visual masterpiece; but for those who appreciate a subtler, slower story line, it is a narrative success as well. Does the movie revel in showing off its mind boggling special effects? Does it, at times, seem more like an impressive art gallery than a film? Yes and yes, but even 50 years later, the special effects are amazing enough to warrant the rather pretentious display. It is clear that Kubrick's vision influenced nearly all sci-fi movies set in space up through the 21st century, and the only things that clue into its date of creation are the costumes and lack of outrageous CGI monsters. The calm, long shots of space and the spaceship set to classical music allow the audience to take in every bit of the mystical, beautiful, and slightly intimidating aspects to space and technology that Kubrick wished to convey.
One of the main complaints about 2001: A Space Odyssey is its length and slow plot. There is no denying that the movie moves at a slow pace or that it is long (about two and a half hours), but whether this works in the service of the movie or not is as matter of preference. Admittedly, the style of storytelling is slightly difficult to adjust to when an one is used to the current space movie genre, which often entails exciting action and an ensemble of characters whose personal relationships form a core of the movie. In 2001, the suspense is much quieter, but the drawn out length keeps it simmering constantly under the surface. Instead of an ensemble cast with charismatic characters, the core of the movie contains one human and one supercomputer, HAL. Additionally, the cerebral nature of the third act is radically different from those of Star Wars, Star Trek, and other epic space movies. However, the story line is still thought-provoking, exciting, and fairly simple to follow once its unique form is accepted and celebrated.",
587,8 October 2013,ghostninjafire,10, A window into the vastness of space and its deep loneliness,"Only after Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odissey science fiction film genre was taken seriously, it is a window into the vastness of space and its deep loneliness. In 1968 (one year before the 1st Trip to the Moon) was created this masterpiece which immediately became a reference work for all science fiction and, for me, has never been surpassed by another film of the same. The film's story is complicated and the way we're told does not make it easier. 2001 is a question about why we are here. But, as Kubrick said, ""You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of '2001'"". To understand it, you have to think about the monolith as an E.T.'s 'tool' watching the evolution of the human race, it represents a challenge. Firstly, Apes are afraid, curious yet, brave, qualities that make them invent the TOOL (starting with bones). Secondly, in space, Man faces this monolith the same way apes did, with curiosity (but this time, with times gone bye, his main tool is a computer). In space, Man has to learn how to walk again, how to go to toilet and has to eat baby food which means, the leader of Earth is a baby in Space.Thirdly, there's HAL-9000, a computer (Man's tool) who starts to 'think' humans are stupid and boring (chess newbies) using warmed-up food and artificial sun. The ultimate tool doesn't need this apes. Man's intense breath in space means we are in space like fishes out of water. Finally, Man loses control of his tools, beginning a battle between Man and 'Alive' Machines. The Computer has won but it didn't calculate the ignorance of the stupid Ape who surprisingly kills HAL-9000 with the most basic tool, a screwdriver. In 2001's final moments, Man, alone in space, prepared to face the unknown and face the ultimate challenge: HIS OWN DEATH. Our evolution was so all based in our tools, but, in the end, it tried to replace us.",

On the flip side of things. I also read the books 2001 and 2010 around the time 2010 came out at the theater. I loved the books. Since have I have read the books 2061 and 3001. I hope they come up with film adaptations of those.",
594,9 October 2020,Horst_In_Translation,6, More than one odyssey,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is an Ammerican/British co-production mostly in the English language. This is from 1968, so it had its 50th anniversary actually not too long ago. The director is Stanley Kubrick and he is also one of the two writers in charge here. Many say this is the best and defining film from Kubrick's body of work and regardless if you agree or disagree, this is quite a statement of course looking at the powerful filmography he came up with. I would say it is one of his best, but maybe not the number one, but I will get to that later saying what I liked the most and what was not too appealing. There are several versions out there with different running times, but you can say that you will never find a version under two hours or over three hours. I think the most common is right in the middle at 150 minutes. This film was nominated for four Oscars, including writing and direction for Kubrick, but no Best Picture nod. It took home the win for its visual effects, which is worth noting because that win went to Kubrick indeed as well and it was meant to stay the only time he would ever win an Oscar. Kinda ironic with all the stuff he wrote and directed that it was visual effects that became his only triumph with the Academy. He was not there to accept. I have not too much to say about the cast here. This is never really an actors movie at all. Still they do what is required and asked from them to make sure it becomes a good film overall and here and there we also get a scene that is nicely acted. The one that comes immediately to mind is the one where they try to get some information (in a friendly manner) from the astronaut, but he won't say a word. The only other male there asking him was from the East no? So this could be a slight implication of Cold War effects. It is also by today's standards a bit ironic that they pretend there was some dangerous disease going on, a pandemic if you want to call it that, and that is the reason why they won't let people on the planet. But it's all an invention and the truth lies elsewhere. This film can easily be structured into three or four segments. The first would be the scenes a long, long time ago when there were no humans yet on the planet. The second is the one with the daughter's father and his trip to the moon. The third is then the one 18 months later and the trip to Jupiter. And finally, what happens after the protagonist of the third segment manages to take out HAL is the fourth and final segment although you could make a point there too for this epilogue still being part of the third segment.",

596,10 October 2002,homegrownherbal,1, Masterpiece-of-crap,"2001: A Space Odyssey, was without a doubt, the lamest, most boring, most unentertaining, poor excuse for a film, waste of time, I've ever seen! Whenever there was any form of live action, there was absolute silence. Whenever there was nothing to see but black, it was accompanied by the most horrible set of minor and dimished chords you could imagine. It was a waste of 2 and a half hours. I constantly kept repeating, ""THE END"" hoping that the film would heed my request. I don't see how it can be called a masterpiece. It was nothing but a series of segways from one scene to the next, with each segway getting longer and each scene getting shorter. The most excruciating scene had to be when the ship was entering Jupiter's orbit. A 15 minute sequence with simple images slowly flashing on the screen after being run through a filter. The music sounded as if a three year old had been sat behind a piano and been allowed to bang on the keys. Coming in at a close second, was the first 20 minutes in which nothing happened except two clans of monkeys fought, after it took one of them 19 minutes to realize that a bone could be used as a beating device. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

601,12 January 2022,guskeller,10, Perfection,"2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the greatest films ever because it is genuine art. Its ambitious narrative, iconic filmmaking, and genius direction make it a spiritual experience. First, the writing tackles heavy subjects of evolution, control, and purpose in a straightforward (yet interpretable) story. This combination of meaning, abstraction, and simplicity is special. Still, the film is more than its script because Stanley Kubrick provides unparalleled vision. Through conscious imagery, sound, and pacing, 2001 evokes a deeply moving tone. The film is light on traditional plot or characters, yet spiritually impacts viewers by summoning primal notions.",

It has a lot of the same elements of the music of the period - long, drawn out, surreal sections of time full of discordant images (or sounds).  It is most likely art and as such, appreciated or hated by its viewers.  But as a movie, I thought it stunk.  As a storyteller, it stunk. I'm sure people will try to explain the film's cosmic beauty or underlying amazingness on a level I will never understand, or tell me that it's precisely because it bored me to tears and was mostly incoherent and repetitive that makes it great.  Maybe I shouldn't have read the book first. But I can not imagine ever wanting to see this movie again.",

616,2 October 2014,HodorTheMagnificent,10, The greatest Sci-Fi film to grace the cinema (Some Spoilers),"I could go on about this movie for a very long time but I think a brief review is much more helpful to the masses. I am 15 years old and in my age group films such as these are usually overlooked in favour of the ""widely-praised"" action and sci-fi films of today. It is sad to see that my age group might never have the chance to see one of the most revolutionary films of all time. From start to finish this movie awes and surprises in it's grand quest to show the evolution of mankind in an almost silent film. For the most part the viewer is presented with an array of beautiful if not stunning shots of space, ships and planets. The film is so revolutionary that these shots feel like they're out of the 1980s and not 1968. I won't go too much into the ending or the story as my own interpretation is likely to be quite different from anyone else's. This is the genius of the film. It presents itself subtly and forces the viewer to think. A quality which almost every modern film lacks and it saddens me to see the dumbed- down films that have a chokehold on the industry and that movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey will be likely forgotten in the wake of this mass idiocy.",

618,9 October 1998,Deckard-16,10, Still the best film of all-time.,"This was the movie that made me fall in love with movies --needless to say it also my all-time favorite. 2001 is a movie that demands that you watch it and not listen to it. It refuses to spell out what is going on although it has a perfectly coherent plot. Its ending is debatable only to those who can't make up their minds(I think it is all about Man's transcendence --as opposed to evolution-- into the next level of existence). It is a film for right-brained --i.e. non-verbal, non-linear-- thinkers. 2001 is more than 30 years old and like all classic films has the freshness of today's latest release. Even the f/x have held up over time. I think the ""Voyage Beyond Infinity"" sequence ranks as one of the top 5 f/x sequences ever. I was 14 years old when I first saw it (about 5 years after it was first released) and I don't think I've ever fully returned from it. (This movie was the most powerful ""say NO to drugs"" statement ever made to me.) There have only been a handful of films over years that can be classified as ""pure cinema"" and 2001 is the best of them.",

630,1 July 2002,NateW,10, A totally unique cinema experience,"Over the years 2001 has gained a lofty position as one of the best and most influential sci-fi films ever made. While it is certainly a well made and unique film, it's an acquired taste that will take multiple viewings to appreciate. Many people see it as a mind boggling one-of-a-kind movie that remains among the best American films, others see it as a boring, confusing ego trip on the part of Kubrick. Seeing as how Stanley Kubrick is one of my favorite directors, I has grown accustomed to his directorial style. I feel that Kubrick made this film the way he did to convey the empty, vast feeling of space with long sustained periods of slow moving objects and silence. 2001 is definitely not a film for casual viewing. Although it is rather slow moving, you really need to watch every second of this film to soak in the environment and atmosphere that Kubrick creates. It is far ahead of it's time in content and effects, but the effects do not replace plot as is the case of most adventure movies churned out today at a regular pace.  He really leaves the film open to induvidual interpretation, which is something all great films should do. I gave up several times on 2001 before I finally saw it all the way through. After two viewings, I now feel that it is indeed one of the great sci-fi films and it is not for all viewers.

Space has never been represented as convincingly as here. I was mesmerized by the effects work and sets. The camera work was dazzling. The movie is technically unparalelled. It is a pure feast for the eyes and ears. Effective use of classical and paranoia music. But does it have a plot? The amount of messages, and their depth, is mind-boggling. Can't be fully appreciated in one viewing. I've seen it twice, and I still don't get it entirely. This could be the most abstract and ambiguous film ever made. More than a film, it's a piece of art, like a painting. Open to numerous interpretations and points of view. The ending especially will leave you confused and dazzled.
