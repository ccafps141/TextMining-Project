0,24 December 2003,Quinoa1984,10," ""You don't mind if I kill all of you?"" ""What? Kill me if you can!"" ""It'll hurt.""","Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo is a not too long, not too short action film that uses its action with just the right touches of voracity and excitement, and in the backdrop is also a sense of humor to the process. If I had to recommend a Kurosawa film to someone who's never seen one before (and might be impatient to sit through the three and a half hour Seven Samurai, or might not get the non-linear structure of Rashomon), I'd put this one in their hands to try out.",/
1,26 September 1999,Peach-2,10, Kurosawa.,"Only a handful of directors know atmosphere the way Akira Kurosawa does, only a handful. Yojinbo opens with a tracking shot of a ronin samurai walking down a dusty road. The camera wisely stays behind the samurai, played by Toshiro Mifune, so we cannot see his face or expressions. This samurai is desperate. Mifune has no master and no money. Kurosawa doesn't let you see his desperation, instead focusing on the back of his head and his profile to set up one of the most memorable characters in cinema history. The film has been copied many times, its practically the most influential film of the modern action genre. Yojinbo isn't action packed however, Kurosawa takes his time setting up characters and plot. The fact that this masterless samurai has deep compassion for strangers is different than most modern action movies alone. Toshiro Mifune is magical in the lead role. His presence is felt all throughout the film even when he isn't on camera. All film buffs should watch this film, it is a perfect example of a director and actor with confidence in their craft.",r
2,6 February 2004,Ben_Cheshire,9, The epitome of cinema cool.,"If you ever watched Pulp Fiction and thought: movie cool was born here, or maybe you saw any single Sergio Leone movie and thought: this guy invented movie-cool (if you haven't, i thoroughly recommend it - Kill Bill is nothing to his Good, the Bad and the Ugly or Once Upon a Time in the West), then experience Yojimbo, or The Bodyguard. Kurosawa's camera sits behind Toshiro Mifune's man-with-no-name, inviting us to look up at the back of his head as he walks the earth, inviting us to be in awe of this man. And as he walks, super-cool walking-the-earth music plays. Later on, when he's taunted and asked to prove himself, he slices a guy's arm off and plays the petty, money-grabbing rival factions in the town he wanders into off each other.",e
3,9 November 2002,funkyfry,10, First class samurai action tale with philosophy to boot,"Classic samurai action pic; often imitated but never equalled.  Mifune creates a memorable character (who appeared in a sequel) in the Ronin who decides the course of his life on the toss of a stick, and ends up risking his life to save a village full of peasants he finds revolting.  It's possible to see ""Yojimbo's"" actions as either heroic or as the game of a bored warrior in need of amusement -- as often in Kurosawa's films, the fact that the characters' motives remain open to interpretation adds depth to the film.",v

5,27 October 2009,murtaza_mma,9, A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune - The undisputed masters of their respective arts,"Yojimbo is a timeless masterpiece; elegant, enigmatic and taut; one of the best and the most influential of the action movies, and a delectable feast to the lovers of the genre. It is the most sought-after of the Akira Kurosawa's movies, shamelessly imitated on multiple occasions – the most infamous being 'A Fistful of Dollars' by Sergio Leone. Yojimbo is a delightful addition to an unending list of avant-garde movies made by the Oriental master. It is as superior to any of the movies that it has inspired as a master is to his artless apprentice. ",e

7,17 October 2006,faraaj-1,10, Kurosawa's most entertaining film,"Yojimbo, based on noir writer Dashiel Hammett's Red Harvest is a magnificently entertaining film. Toshiro Mifune stars as the nobody who calls himself Sanjuro (thirty but closer to forty). He enters a town destroyed by warring factions and plays a double-game to pit one faction against the other thus destroying the criminal element.",/
8,17 September 2002,OttoVonB,10, Reinventing the Western,"After a string of classic masterpieces, Kurosawa confronted his influences head-on. Throwing John Ford's Western aesthetics into a blender and painting them pitch black. The results are Yojimbo and its legacy.",r
9,21 July 2011,ilpohirvonen,9, Homo Homini Lupus,"The famous Latin phrase ""homo homini lupus"" meaning ""man is a wolf to (his fellow) man,"" could easily be the motto of Akira Kurosawa's 21st film Yojimbo (1961). It is purely a genre-film at its best: a film in which the basic realizations and contents of a genre have been internalized perfectly. In this case the genre is samurai-film which is strongly related to the genre of western. Whereas from western the American mythology exhales, from samurai-film Japanese does. Although, the history of samurai-film extends to the 1930-40's it found its dynamic form and was truly born in the early 1950's when Japanese films first came to Europe. The genre still lives on but Yojimbo is, without a doubt, among the five best samurai-films ever made. Both, ironic humor and conception of the eternal weakness of the human nature characterize this exquisite film about a mythical character.",w
10,6 June 2006,Witchfinder-General-666,10, Kurosawa's Influential Stroke Of Genius,"Akira Kurosawa is widely (and rightly) thought of as one of the most important filmmakers in the history of motion pictures. ""Yojimbo"", one of the masterpieces that have earned him this more than deserved reputation, is not only one of the best, but also one of the most influential movies ever made. Only three years after its release another great director, Sergio Leone, who named Yojimbo one of his favorite movies, used it as the model for another masterpiece, ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" and rose the Italian Western to an international level.",7
11,17 February 2015,ironhorse_iv,9, Director Akira Kurisowa's Yojimbo is a masterpiece. Yojimbo is still pretty sharp.,"Loosely based on Dashiell Hammett's western novel Red Harvest and Glass Key. This jidaigeki (period drama film), tells the story of an unnamed ronin (Toshiro Mifune), who arrives in a small town in 1860 Japan, where competing crime lords, Seibei, the Brothel Owner (Seizaburô Kawazu) and Ushitora, the Arms Dealer (Tatsuya Nakadai) fight each other for supremacy. The two bosses each try to hire the deadly newcomer as a yojimbo AKA bodyguard, but the unnamed ronin has a secret plan to get rid of both of them, by playing both rivals against each other in the hope that they will wipe each other out, faster than ever. Without spoiling too much of it, this movie is a great Samurai film, that is worth the watch only. The movie is beautiful shot. Director Akira Kurosawa's films are notable for being stunning visually, with beautiful backgrounds, sometimes verging on Scenery Porn. This movie might not have much of the Japanese landscape in the background, but it made great use of the set, and the weather. The way, he know how to use actors in a wide screen frame is amazing. He place actors in the foreground. Middle ground in the left or right. Sharp focus. Director John Ford type of a style. He use the shutters and doors, well on the Japanese set to reset shots so dynamically. Without cutting the shutters and door, create a look of comic book panels, frame by frame. Like in most Kurosawa films, rainy weather is present in a few scenes, increasing the effect of the characters' discomfort making emotional seem real. The windy weather all throughout the film represents the chaotic life in the town. The wind blowing while Yojimbo walks inspired many Japanese Animes and films. Kurosawa originated a lot of film techniques that are still being used today. A form of cinematic punctuation very strongly identified with Kurosawa is the wipe as a transitional device. It is used as a substitute for the straight cut or the dissolve. Yojimbo had great pan-focus shots, because they were crucial to the action. Action shot with a few long shots. It's way different than how action is film, today. This is one reason this movie stands the test of time so well. One thing that the movie does so well is editing. Kurosawa was a master in that. He was so good and quick, that Yojimbo had its Japanese premiere on four days after shooting concluded. Still, the movie does have some problems, as its jump back and forth between drama and comedy. It's a bit jarring at times. Most of the humor were hits than miss. I love the look of Sanjuro AKA Yojimbo's face when he sees the dog carrying the sever hand. The violence and gore was pretty intense, at times. It's weird to see, bloody limps being chop off in an early 1960s film, seeing how strict, Japanese censors were, at the time. The cycles of violence in this film is a lot tamer than that of 1954 Seven Samurai. Yojimbo's script is pretty good, but it lacks the intellectual challenge of 1950's Rashomon, the moral resonance of 1952's Ikiru, and the sweeping grandeur of Seven Samurai. He made a couple of great samurai films, but after seeing several of them, they get to be a bit repetitive. Most of the villains are forgettable. They are two-dimensional comically idiots without a shred of redeeming humanity thought. Kurosawa told Tatsuya Nakadai that his character was a snake, so Nakadai moves very snake-like. It didn't help, as his character has little to no personality at all. I just know him, as the man with the creepy smile, snake motion and the gun. The supporting characters, he helps out aren't memorable. I was really hoping more from the old undertaker and his family. Toshiro Mifune as the main lead was great. He's not only one of the greatest Japanese actors of all-time, but is one of the greatest actors of all-time period. Toshiro Mifune is a great actor, capable of great range and subtlety of expression. A complete badass, and everybody comes to realize this very quickly. He was able to perform, the way, the director wanted to. Akira Kurosawa told Toshiro Mifune to act like a stray dog, which is why he twitches his shoulders and scratches himself a lot during the film. The character of Sanjiro can be viewed as an early example of the ""Man with No Name"" because he made the name up at the shot. Kurosawa was often criticized by his countrymen for perceived ""arrogant"" behavior, and you see that in this character. In many ways, the main lead character mirrors Kurosawa at the time. Claims of personal arrogance and harsh treatment of colleagues were often, said about the director. He could even sometimes be hard on seasoned, highly respected film professionals. During the filming of this, he lost his temper with one of Japan's preeminent cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa. He was often, very tiresome, during filming. This movie would be, one of his last best influencing films. Still, it's been years since this movie first came out, but it's still influencing how films are made today. In 1964, Yojimbo was remade as Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars, a Spaghetti Western starring Clint Eastwood as the Man with No Name. Leone and his production company failed to secure the remake rights to Kurosawa's film, resulting in a lawsuit that delayed the western release for three years. The movie influenced a lot of other movies in the west over time like 1996's Walter Hill gangster film, ""Last Man Standing"" and others. The movie even got a sequel, 1962's Sanjuro. The music from this film by Masaru Satô is very powerful to listen to. It's often use in other films and trailers. The film is easy to find. Try to get the Criterion Collection for the best value, just note that there is no English dubbing. Overall: It's a must-watch. Will Recommended.",0
12,16 June 2012,TheLittleSongbird,10, Another Kurasawa masterpiece,"Akira Kurasawa is one of my favourite directors as of now. And Yojimbo does nothing to make me change that, if anything like Seven Samurai, Ran, Ikiru, Hidden Fortress, Rashomon and Throne of Blood it is another of his masterpieces. Like Hidden Fortress was a major influence on Star Wars, Yojimbo did the same for Fistful of Dollars. I've seen them compared a lot, but all I will say that for me both are milestones of their respective genres and both are movies to watch if not done so already. Back to Yojimbo, as always for a Kurasawa film, it is superbly made and made absolutely beautifully with epic scenery and great, stylish use of camera techniques. The music adds much to the story, and is remarkably atmospheric, the script is a fine mix of comedy, intrigue and sudden and quite unrelenting violence and the story is compelling and always entertaining, managing to both celebrate and subvert(but in a subtle way) the samurai genre. Toshiro Mifune I have yet to see a bad performance from, and again he is a superb lead, who could be seen as an anti-hero as he sells his skills yet dupes both sides of the feudal community into slaughter. Overall, another fantastic film from perhaps the King of Japanese cinema. 10/10 Bethany Cox",4

15,30 June 2013,freemantle_uk,9, Classic Kurosawa centred around one great performance,"Yojimbo is one of Akira Kurosawa's most celebrated films in his career and was remade by Sergio Leone into A Fistful of Dollars. It is considered an essential film and a classic in the samurai genre. Toshiro Mifune was excellent as the nameless ronin who sets out to protect the town, being a man of few words. Kurosawa is of course excellent at setting up the conflict in the town and how it affects the people whilst also delivering on fine samurai sword fights (a man even has his hand cut off). Kurosawa wonderfully lets his scenes play out with plenty of long shots and small camera movements. Kurosawa and his actors also inject some occasional moments of humours to help lighten the mood when need be. But for the most Yojimbo is a serious drama with some very dark elements. Out of the Kurosawa films I have seen I personally prefer Seven Samurai for its scale and Rashomon for its ambition, but Yojimbo is still a worthy film and true film buffs need to watch it.",5
16,17 August 2016,avik-basu1889,9, The Original Man with No Name !!!,"'Yojimbo' was Kurosawa's most commercially successful film in his home country of Japan. Now some critics and viewers tend to justify this commercial success by calling the film an entertaining action film without much substance. But after having watched it for the 3rd time in a matter of a year, I will have to disagree with that opinion. Yes, the film is very entertaining, but the screenplay written by Kurosawa and Ryuzo Kikushima is deceptively deep and meaningful.",3

Perennial Kurosawa player, Toshiro Mifune, is the ""Ronin""--a wandering samurai who is looking for work. He comes to a town and is surprised by the condition of the people. There are two rival warring gangs in the town and the people are literally held captive by the mass of depraved men hired by the two leaders. These bored samurai make life all but impossible for decent people.",/
18,12 September 2020,rooprect,9," ""A truly good movie is enjoyable too. There's nothing complicated about it.""","That's a quote from Kurosawa, if you hadn't already guessed. Here in ""Yojimbo"" (""The Bodyguard"") he shows us exactly what he meant. This film is a real treat for the artsy crowd as well as people who go to the movies just to have fun. It's a technical marvel and layered in its story, and yet there's nothing complicated about it. If you're new to Kurosawa, or art films in general, definitely start here.",?

20,17 December 2013,lastliberal-853-253708,9, I'm not dying yet. I have to kill quite a few men first.,"The first ""man with no name"" was Toshirô Mifune, who made 16 films with writer/director Akira Kurosawa, starting with Drunken Angel in 1948, and ending with Red beard in 1965. This is one of his greatest performances. ",e
21,23 November 2013,rdoyle29,9, A masterful blend of genres,"It's no surprise that this has been adapted as both a western and a gangster movie since it blends elements of both genres along with the samurai genre. The setting is typically western with the town consisting of businesses lining a central road and much of the plot follows a western blueprint, leading up to a final showdown in the center of town. It's not just the plot that is transferred over to ""A Fistful of Dollars"", but much of the look and visual style of the film is also adopted. The characters seem to come from somewhere else though. The film is a loose adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's ""Red Harvest"", and that novel's gangster characters seem to have been dropped into the western/samurai setting. The cross-genre blending is brilliant, allowing for new heights of cynicism and black comedy in the samurai, and ultimately the western, genre.",f
22,9 February 2014,Tweekums,9, A Fistful of Ryo!,This is a story that will be familiar to anybody who has seen Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti western 'A Fistful of Dollars' as that film is a virtual remake of this classic samurai film! It opens with an unnamed samurai entering a town; he soon learns that there are two rival groups vying to run the place and he decides to destroy them both and get well paid in the process by working for both sides and stirring up as much conflict as he can. All appears to be going well for him until he decides to help a man whose wife was taken by one of the gang leaders this act of sympathy could cost the samurai his life.,_
23,24 September 2004,The_Void,8, Just another masterful movie from the master of masterful movies,"Akira Kurosawa's tribute to the western is a marvelous piece of cinema. Toshirô Mifune stars as a ronin (samurai without a master) that goes to a small town, which is divided by two gangs of criminals. While there, he decides to play one off against the other in order to defeat both gangs. Yojimbo lacks the depth of some of Kurosawa's other films, such as Rashomon or Seven Samurai, but it is, on the whole, more entertaining and much more accessible than those two mentioned films, and most of the rest of Kurosawa's oeuvre. That's not to say that Yojimbo lacks substance however; there's more than enough here to please fans of Kurosawa's other works. Just like the majority of Kurosawa's films, Yojimbo is spectacularly well filmed. The black and white cinematography looks absolutely incredible, and the some of the scenes, in particular that involve rain, are extremely atmospheric and lend the movie a great gloomy style. ",=
24,18 March 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, A fistful of Ryo.,"You'd be forgiven for thinking that 'Yojimbo (1961)' is familiar if you've already seen 'A Fistful Of Dollars (1964)'; Leone's western is pretty much a shot for shot remake of the Kurasowa classic. Its long stretches of silence before a duel, its grimacing faces of weather-worn goons and its brief flashes of stylish violence all clearly inspired the design of the entire 'Dollars' trilogy. This is only really relevant to the experience of 'Yojimbo (1961)' if you watch the two movies in reverse (as it were), as they really are almost identical in narrative and tone. It's a good thing, then, that they're about as good as one another. This samurai story sees a nameless wanderer work his way between two feuding gang bosses, making as much money as possible and maybe just saving the people who really matter along the way. Mifune's protagonist is a bit of a blank slate, his underlying morals hidden behind a facade of unflinching toughness. For as good as he is with a blade, he rarely has to use it. This lack of action isn't a problem, however, as it simply makes the few fights there are all the more impactful. They're fast, frenetic and dirty, stained with beautifully shot black-and-white blood. There's a coldness about the killing that mightn't sit right with a good chunk of the audience and that's a valid criticism. Still, the thing moves fast enough that no cruelty is ever lingered on, focused on delivering a tight and engaging plot right from the start. It's an entertaining film, even if it isn't as deep or emotionally impactful as some of Kurosawa's other work. It's carefully crafted and stands the test of time, too. 7/10",t

32,3 June 2016,jboothmillard,6, Yojimbo (The Bodyguard),"I had sen this Japanese film listed in the television schedules a number of times, always on the same channel, Film4, it is rated five out of five stars by critics, so I decided it was definitely worth a watch, directed by Akira Kurosawa (Rashomon, Ikiru, Seven Samurai). Basically samurai Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshirô Mifune) finds himself in the middle of a Japanese village with feuding, neither side is particularly honorable, but Sanjuro is hungry and impoverished, so he finds work as a bodyguard (or Yojimbo) for a silk merchant Tazaemon (Kamatari Fujiwara). Sanjuro chooses over a job working for sake brewer Tokuemon (Takashi Shimura), but he pretends to work for him, as part of a plan for them to tear each other apart, but he is eventually arrested for treachery. Sanjuro escapes in time to see the two warring sides fight to the finish, the plan all along was to create and restore peace, Sanjuro leaves the village for further exploits, the character returned in the sequel titled Sanjuro a year later. Also starring Eijirô Tôno as Gonji the Tavern Keeper, Seizaburô Kawazu as Seibê the Brothel Operator, Isuzu Yamada as Orin, Hiroshi Tachikawa as Yoichiro and Susumu Fujita as Homma the Instructor Who Skips Town. The performances are fine, and the direction as always is great from Kurosawa, I will admit I did not pay the fullest attention to everything going on, and it did get confusing at times, but the 19th century feel is authentic, and the sword skill and fight scenes catch your eye, I can see some reasons why it would get full marks from critics, it did influence A Fistful of Dollars and the ""spaghetti western"" genre, a worthwhile adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Costume Design. Very good!",

34,14 November 2009,dwpollar,3, Confusing feudal piece...,"1st watched 11/14/2009 - 3 out of 10 (Dir- Akira Kurosawa): Confusing feudal piece about an old samurai warrior coming into a town and causing confusion between the parties leading to greater destruction because of it. Toshiro Mifune plays the samurai who kind of plays with both parties and tricks them into hating each other even more by his manipulative ways. Initially, it's a little comedic how he plays with them but them he gets beaten up and the innocent get thrown into the mix and the humor leaves. This movie is really hard to follow because it's hard to identify each party as unique. One group are gamblers and the others are protectors of a brothel. The town obviously has no real presence of authority but the drifter doesn't bring any of that into play by being there. I'm assuming that this is because the wars are over and there is no one in power. I'm sure it would help to understand a little of the Japanese history to understand this movie -- unfortunately I have none. The movie really becomes pretty brutal and those left standing are just lucky -- I guess. Mifune's portrayal is a little confusing as well as he kind of snickers at both sides until he's beaten up and then he takes things into his own hands. A much heralded Japanese director in Akira Kurasawa made this film but I'm sorry I just didn't get the appeal of this movie.",

The film itself is beautiful to look at (there are several great compositions) and has the feel of a new paradigm, with Mifume's very human antihero up against a realistically violent, unsavory world.

Now, I will deal with this movie in a very different way. I first saw ""A Fistful of Dollars"", so I couldn't help but compare the two while watching.
In terms of stories, following Yojimbo, ""A Fistful of Dollars"" almost beats every beat. The key difference is the attitude of each movie. Fistful of Dollars is more human: you are more sympathetic to the law-abiding Baxter family. But at Yojimbo, both parties are as corrupt as the other, so you can't help but agree with the samurai: calm down, no doubt, they are both dead, the situation will be better.
The samurai himself is also a charming character. Unless violence is involved, he seems to be uninterested in almost everything. I especially liked the early scenes, where he put both tribes on the brink of battle, and he just sat down to watch!
In a sense, the proceedings are completely different, so that I began to appreciate Yojimbo itself. I feel like I have settled in the urban environment. This fact further helps.
Overall, this is a wonderful story that keeps the barbarian community balanced",

Later remade as Sergio Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (which led to ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and ""Once Upon A Time In The West""), Akira Kurosawa's medevial ""western"" is just as enjoyable, violent and stylish as Clint Eastwood's ""spaghetti"" Western that most movie fans are familair with. It is rare that a film and its subsequent re-make can be equally enjoyable and of equal quality, but such is the case.  In Kurosawa's original, Toshiro Mifune portrays ""The Man With No Name"" and is just as mysterious, witty and sarcastic as that tough, skinny American.  Fans of Leone's Westerns would be very wise to witness this great film.  Comparisons are pretty futile since both are of different cultural settings and the action in both are exceedingly excellent.

Toshiro Mifune is a samurai who travels around the country until he reaches into town that is ruled by two rival families. The samurai sees the situation as an easy way to make some money, as he pours more fuel into the fire with doing small deeds to both families. Although we learn that the samurai is not only greedy swordsman, but his real motivations can be interpreted many ways by the end of the film.

I have to emphasize that best of them are not even close to Yojimbo. Not even close considering anything, so I will just sadly disregard dumb comments posted as Kurosawa Vs Sergio Leone. Is there anyone of you that can say: ""Mozart Vs Moricone""? Is that comparable? Well, I let that judgment to your gray cells responsible for art value and taste. Toshiro Mifune had represented the whole new movie culture until that time, the film idea of one man against the whole world. Yojimbo is someone who serves that idea originally and never seen until then - in traditional Japanese way. His later decent, Bruce Lee is putting that idea practically in the modern form: English language, western manners and western money. This is why I like to call Toshiro Mifune the spiritual father of modern action film, while Bruce Lee is a hero who was a practical establisher. Kurosawa is without doubt the greatest master of action movies of all times. His sense for dramatic directing, smart camera, short and dynamic dialogs and far best usage of music in action films makes him the grandmaster of its kind. He is manipulating with deepest human emotions of the spectator and by that Yojimbo is far from just action movie which makes it number one. What is the miraculous about this film is that it maintains your attention every single second on the highest level, involving you every single second deeper and deeper.

Let's think about science-fiction idea, when we enter the world of cinema, we know that ""Metropolis"" is one of the first science- fiction motion pictures. Or, like ""Psycho"", the very first American- great-horror-film. The idea of horror, however, imitated by other movie creator, that they can make people frightened with their movie. And even the idea of the movie is basically from the experience of the creator, which is influenced by other people. With that assumption, I think that ""Yojimbo"" brings brand-new-soul of the movie. As note, this is my first Kurosawa's, so maybe there was another more pure idea than ""Yojimbo"". This new idea is the idea to impart, take sides to the truth, the ""real- truth"", and the deep meaning of peace. I mean the feeling when you are in safe and wealth. The thought that we must not escape the reality and keep fighting until the truth win against falsity. Yes, that idea is in many stories, but the idea to translate such a complex story to a background such as this movie is really brilliant.",

He has a great ability to construct everything very thoughtfully - the framing, cinematography, action and acting show a great deal of artistic care. The portrayal of the lead samurai is stoic, detached, shrewd and nigh-invincible, an archetype that is as influential as the film itself. The samurai is victorious through a combination of strength, wits and compassion, no matter what happens. Like Seven Samurai (which I actually think is the superior film), Kurosawa goes deeply into the conditions of the town, the brewing conflict and the plight of the characters to make the environment feel real and the issue feel pressing.

This particular film, ""The Bodyguard"", was remade into a film that made Clint Eastwood a star - A Fistful of Dollars. But to be honest, I think Kurosawa's film was better, and here's why. Unlike his maniacal role in Seven Samurai, in this film Toshiro Mifune's character is calm, wry, cynical and scheming. As a solitary Samurai swordsman wandering into a village he manages to manipulate both groups of criminals against each other while taking money (and sometimes returning it) from each in turn.

This movie does not need colors, or let me put it this way: the black and white colors simply fit to the storyline. Well, the storyline: Classic and awesome.

For those not familiar with the tale of copyright controversy, ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is really an unauthorized remake of ""Yojimbo"", which led Kurosawa to successfully sue Leone for copying his film.

132,17 January 2014,django822,10, Utterly brilliant,"The beginning of this tale, when our hero tosses a stick into the air to see which way it lands to choose his path, is just one of the many elements which makes this such an amazing story and one my favorites of Kurosawa's many masterpieces. What the bodyguard chooses to do first with his newfound independence is quite surprising and ambitious, like piecing together an amazingly complex jigsaw puzzle made of human nature, or staging a performance of an epic masterpiece with no previous management, production, or directing skills. But I guess he may as well tackle a mountain, since there is not much use starting small with his skills and personality. As he orchestrates the deception, our hero is much like a master puppeteer with exquisite timing and talent to incite the mayhem to achieve his goal. While the basic theme of this story is not unique - the result of greed, manipulation of others, and the changing of the world (tradition vs. progression) - many factors add an interesting and unusual charm to this film. There are plots within plots, surprising deception, perfectly paced mounting tension, unpredictable plot twists, stories within stories, distinctive and amusing characters (the big guy with his huge mallet is a lot of fun), the seemingly never-ending face offs, backstabbing, character flaws; and our hero continually placed in the perfect position to observe, listen, and evaluate. Also, the bodyguard's impeccable timing in manipulation of both sides is nice, fulfilling our expectations and keeping the story moving along. What if bodyguards were really like this? (mischievous, brilliant, manipulative) The famous people of the world would be in terrible trouble.",

Make sure you're not squeamish by the sight of decapitated limbs and swords smashing into samurais. Kurosawa is the original master of the violent Japanese samurai flick. I wouldn't be surprised if Quentin Tarantino gets down on his knees and prays to him by his bedside at night. This genre of film that he created is based upon the period of ""Jidaigeki"", which has its origins in Kabuki theater. It's the music of the swords. It's the story of brave samurais fighting in honor of their families and towns. It might sound foreign to you, but it's really not. ""Jidaigeki"" genre movies supplied many concepts and ideas that inspired what we all know as the Spaghetti Western. Well, you should know, it was a little too inspired, but that's a story to get into another day. Kurosawa's films have an amazing shelf life to cinephiles across the globe, and none more important than ""Rashoman"".

Toshiro Mifune stars in one of his strongest performances as Sanjuro a lone wolf samurai who comes into a small town in Japan in the mid 19th century to rid the town of two rival gangs by pitting them against each other and fighting them on his own, and thus inspired several westerns to follow mainly Sergio Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (1964). Akira Kurosawa was to Japanese samurai films what John Ford was to American westerns, and each of them were masters whose movies are still talked about among film lovers everywhere and for good reason and this movie is another masterpiece in the Kurosawa-Mifune collaboration which is one of the all time great actor-director partnerships in all of movie history. The swordfight scenes are excellently choreographed, and what really helps with the movie is how Kurosawa places the music to build the suspense leading up to the final fight in the end which reminds me of the final shootout in ""High Noon"" when Gary Cooper's Marshall Will Kane had to face off against a gang of outlaws on his own. Mifune was one of those actors in Japan who had as big of a screen presence as John Wayne did in America. Everything about this movie just strikes the right notes especially with the intelligent writing, great performances, Kurosawa's masterful direction, excellent cinematography, and an amazing score.

148,19 October 1998,NEFARlOUS,10, So good they (re) made it twice!,"Yojimbo (the bodyguard) is set approximately two hundred years ago in Japan, during a time of chaos. The film starts with the central character, a Ronin (landless Samurai)at a crossroads. He squats down and spins a bottle. When it stops, he takes the direction indicated. There is a town at war. Two rival factions, each owning factories of some description, have hired mercenaries and criminals and are busy attempting to wipe each other out whilst the ordinary villagers are caught in the middle. The Ronin finds this amusing and starts to play both sides against the middle, first demonstrating his skill by killing a number of mercenaries (Cooper...three coffins *pause* *look* maybe four.....) and accepting one rival's bid and then leaving and accepting the other, leaving also a trail of uncertainty and worry in his wake. The Ronin is unshaven, unwashed and very, very skillful - a shark among minnows. He is also sardonic, sarcastic and gives the appearance of caring nothing. But from time to time, a glimmer of honour and belief shines, albeit briefly before being covered up once more. I won't go into more specific detail about this film lest I ruin it for those that have yet to see it. The director is Akira Kurasawa, the main actor Toshiiro Mifune, two of the best reasons for seeing this film. It was subsequently remade by Morricone as ""a fistful of dollars"". His initial claim that he was remaking Fellini's ""a servant of two masters"" held water for precisely two seconds. It has more recently been remade as ""last man standing"" - both films shallow copies of the original. See it - tape it - buy it.",

A picture of the famous, iconic and outstanding Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, whom I finally got my hands on. This path was long and thorny, especially the choice of his paintings, but after much deliberation, I chose three pictures, and in the near future there will be reviews on them, and this adventure movie comes first, which became the cause of many inspirations and even a scandal between the masters of that time - Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone, but you know this story without me, so I see no reason to retell it here, because it will be a purely painting. And here's my brief opinion - Ronin is putting things in order.

Scenario - the picture tells about the adventures of a wandering ronin, who ends up in a small village, whose inhabitants languish from endless bloodshed, for two strong criminals share power over it. Ronin decides to play on this and it becomes the beginning of a series of events, both fun and not so, fights and the like. The scenario skeleton from this picture was played many times in world cinema, both before this work of Kurosawa (which he himself admitted to) and after (the story with Sergio Leone and beyond), and this is not bad. Akira himself was in charge of the script, and he did a great job with it. I literally could not take my eyes off the screen, because every detail, every movement of the characters and so on, every spoken word clung to me. The ending was known to me, because I watched ""For a Fistful of Dollars"", and it is not only correct, but also effectively filmed. If you love Japanese themes, a good script - then you simply must see this picture!
2. Atmosphere - Japan of the shogunate era, with its familiar attributes - houses, samurai, clothes, characteristic hairstyles, everyday life, and so on. The atmosphere literally captures the viewer from the first frame, and does not let go until the last, and the black and white picture does not interfere with this in any way (especially since black and white cinema saves vision). And lovers of historical cinema will get their portion of pleasure.
3. Humor - I was even surprised at this. He is unassuming here, because almost everything boils down to the stupid behavior of the characters or antics on camera, which turns serious and dramatic scenes into a natural farce, and you feel ashamed of the heroes who do it. Some of the jokes were successful, and I had a lot of fun with them. I could put humor in the minus of the picture until I understood the director's move - Akira deliberately made the heroes like that, therefore - no complaints.
4. Fights - today they look like a fight between drunken Tolkienists, to be frank, because they are absolutely no spectacle. I give credit to the directors and actors who moved in the frame very convincingly and played very naturally. I give a discount for the release time, because this is one thousand nine hundred and sixty-first, ladies and gentlemen and comrades!
A little about the main characters:
1. Ronin performed by Toshiro Mifune is a wandering warrior who, by the will of fate, arrived in the village, where it is urgently necessary to restore order. A cunning fellow and a professional fighter who turns a clever plan. Absolutely not a superhero, but a man with his own mistakes. Laconic and with a pinch of humor - this is how Toshiro's hero turned out, and I liked him. Bravo Toshiro!
2. Daisuke Kato's Inokichi is the brother of one of the village's crime bosses. Cheerful and memorable hero, although it plays a negative role. His antics were very amusing throughout the whole picture. Daisuke clearly coped with the role. Well done!
3. Gonji performed by Eijiro Tohno - owner of the tavern where the ronin is staying. At first, he hates this stranger, but gradually he is imbued with sympathy, and even becomes a friend, since only the ronin is able to end the bloody chaos in the village. Eijiro superbly played the role of a gloomy and eccentric old man. Bravo!
As for the remark, there is one object in the picture that spoils the atmosphere and asks Akira uncomfortable questions, but I will not dwell on this. It's just that this object is in sight and flickers before your eyes all the time. Either this is Akira's jamb, or the creators' flaw, I don't know here.
Well, the next picture of Kurosawa will be the legendary ""Seven Samurai"".
As a result, we have an excellent adventure movie by Akira Kurosawa, with an excellent script, great atmosphere, pleasant and unexpected humor and great acting.",
150,3 November 2002,slowbro13215,8," Very Western, yet very Kurosawa","Well, I've seen most of Kurosawa's major works now, and though I really like Yojimbo, I don't rank it among his best. In fact, I really enjoyed his movies that, yes, were NOT about samurai! Hakuchi (The Idiot) and Tengoku To Jigoku (High And Low) I thought were both better than this one, but I'm not putting down Yojimbo at all. It was a very nice watch in terms of both plot and style, and of course spectacular direction by Kurosawa and acting by Mifune. I also enjoyed the way this movie really seemed like a Western, as this movie was both influenced by past Westerns and influenced future Westerns. Very nice flow to the film.

But will anyone admit it? There only seem to be about two honest reviewers on this site. Although Fistful helped me to understand a little of what was going on, I still didn't understand most of it. I wouldn't have understood anything at all if I hadn't seen Clint and Leone. Towards the end, try as I might, I couldn't help skipping chunks, and I'm sure I didn't miss anything. Mifune had quite good presence, and he had a very healthy appetite and was very thirsty. There was at least one pretty girl. And there was a remarkable midget holding an enormous mallet. Sorry folks, that was it for me. At some future time, when I'm feeling really strong and masochistic, I'll try again, with the commentary option to explain it to me and tell me why it's so fabulous.

152,2 April 2023,moritzherz,7, The movie that defined the western genre,As I started watching this movie it felt like watching one of Leone's dollar trilogy movies. It was then as I realized that this movie has influenced the maestro and therefore defined the western genre.,
153,11 February 2006,leobardo,10, The Dumb,"In the world, there are people who should not comment on anything. Especially those who call things 'boring', or 'a bore', or 'long and drawn out, couldn't stay awake... put it off after ten minutes (this is the @#$@# most stupid comment of them all'...) these people should avoid all commentary, because such comments do not make for a valid statement, are very far from any critical process, and should be thrown out to the street and stepped on, like the own egos who created them. Who could ever find such opinions useful? But of course, this world is far from ideal, far from intelligent, full of idiocy, 'there is no hope for fools' as Mifune once acted. It is true, people are fools. We all are most of the times, but most are always. Thus, we get fools commenting, usually at their most foolish point, writing their own minute visions of 'art' haphazardly, (it's a wonder how they can be so reckless with such simplistic concepts roaming their heads) repeating words like 'junk', and 'waste of my time'... exactly, life is a waste of their time. That's for sure. 'So... you don't mind if I kill you now?' (As Mifune once acted). This movie is a wonderful, universal film. Not at all perfect... (which encumbers a whole nother set of nauseating remarks such as 'perfect film... flawless...unbeatable plot...'). But who wants perfect!? Universal is key and most important here, forget all those people who mistook Kurosawa in Japan... Japan is like all societies, full of idiots, full of close-minded people looking for an ideal, trying to be their own geniuses. Don't need none of that. Done need 'isolationism', 'nationalism', 'my word is right' 'the dogma' 'follow the tradition to the bone or you are a traitor'... And by saying all this, I am basically trying to show what this movie is about. The weakness of all opinion, the fall of all sides without perspective. Only the genius, he who is capable of abstraction, who can analyze behind all notions of bad and good, will withstand time, will survive. None of the rest matters. All of the rest destroys itself, annihilates itself, and could is better off dead... the sooner the better, in fact. Whoever thinks that Kurosawa wrote about the honor of the samurai as a historical institution, is missing the fact that many of his films play on the samurai who to survive must deviate from all known feeling of honor, especially in a film like this, whose premise and character, Sanjuro, represents the 'decadence' of the samurai tradition... A most important aspect - perhaps the only underlying aspect - of the film, stated even before the first dialog appears. This is not a movie about good and evil, about honor and shame... universality goes far beyond this. He who sees the big picture has the gift of immortality, of being universal. This is a movie that, in a very humble, concise and attractive way, exemplifies such artistic ideals, giving an unrealistic power to a man who is more than man. The most beautiful and harrowing aspect of Sanjuro for the townspeople, is that he is his own bodyguard. He is endowed with this poetic perfection, which nobody else has... he almost doesn't exist for them (he is absent during all revenges), because this is unfathomable to everyone in the town. He is God. He is just, brings justice, above all notions of justice. This movie defeats all people who find it boring, and all who could possibly revere it to death, me included. It exists alone. It is it's own nomad. It walks behind us all. Behind anything we could muster up saying about it to describe it. I'm also a fool for writing this comment. The only thing not foolish is watching the film, arriving at that town the way Kurosawa intended us to, without any previous knowledge or prejudice, where there is no good or evil, just people doing what they usually do, think they and only they are right, where things aren't anything that they seem, but at the same time, are only what they appear to be... ruins. To be able to do this, to see it in this way as a viewer, is already a feat. Don't get bored just yet, don't cry out it's genius. Try to be a viewer, make that effort. It's an ideal, I know... it may be forever impossible. But I guess it could also make for a better person in you.",

In his career, there are all-time classics, such as 'Ran', 'Dreams', 'Rashomon', 'Kagemusha' and many others. Most of his movies, specially his early ones, such as 1957's 'Seven Samurai', introduced many concepts that are used in Hollywood nowadays, specially in action movies.

Essentially Dashiell Hammett's ""Red Harvest"" set in nineteenth-century Japan (with elements of two other Hammett novels, ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""The Glass Key,"" thrown in for good measure), ""Yojimbo"" functions as a whole rather than as a series of parts. Even Tatsuya Nakadai's celebrated turn as the pistol-toting punk is something that really only works in the context of the movie; I wouldn't point to it as one of the most brilliant cinematic performances of all time.

It takes place in this small town, and it kind of dumps the entire backstory in one scene and I wish it would've been spread out more, although I understand that would've caused a longer runtime. The movie did start to drag a little probably around 3/4ths of the way through before it quickly picks back up for the last 10 minutes or so. As for the positives, the film has incredible cinematography and choreography (Kurosawa does a great job at making sure the movement of the actors creates an interesting frame). It's not as action packed as Seven Samurai, but the film is very entertaining for the majority of the runtime. This is in part due to the great sense of humor thrown in there. The protagonist of the story is a ronin who is very clever throughout the movie and is acted very well by Toshiro Mifune. If you're wondering about the plot, the film focuses on this samurai (whose name is only said once throughout the entire thing, he's mostly referred to by a nickname or just ""the samurai"") and this small town that has a lot of issues. It's small scale, but there are plenty of stakes and tension throughout. The plot was well crafted, it was very well directed, and everybody was well written. I'd give Yojimbo an 8/10.",

Hale wrote: ""Plato may have denied the existence of ideal forms in this world, but Plato never saw a Viking ship."" In fact, Plato had several disadvantages: he saw the Parthenon, of course; but he never listened to JS Bach, and he never tasted Islay whisky; most relevant here is that Plato never saw a Japanese sword.",
193,9 April 2018,suspiria77,10, My introduction to Kurosawa,"Way back towards the end of the '90s, I saw this film on IFC and it was my very first Kurosawa film. It came on at about 10 in the morning on a Saturday, and I stopped because the film looked so distinctive. The widescreen, the black and white, and Toshiro Mifune just looked so cool standing there. It wasn't far into the movie, but after being mesmerized by what I had seen I immediately looked online to where I could buy it (in widescreen, of course, which was not a given back then) and watched it about ten times within a week. ",
194,25 October 1999,Decath,10, The original is always best,"I liked this movie much better than the two remakes - the one with Clint Eastwood, and the newer one with Bruce Willis.  If you liked this one at all, you should check out Sanjuro - also by Akira Kurosawa.   They are both old and both subtitled, but the swordplay and customs are very historically accurate.",
195,16 July 2021,predatorlm,9, Japanese western,I'm a big western fan and after watching this movie you can really see how samurai are the Japanese cowboy. Well shot with parts that made me laugh. I would definitely watch something similar to this.,
196,9 December 2019,spanixtan,8, Kurosawa. Yojimbo- A new antihero for the westerns,"Akira Kurosawa (1910-1998)and Yasujirô Ozu (1903-1963) are the two giants of Japanese cinema.Their work appear on top ten lists of greatest films ever made. Both disctinctly Japanese but deeply connected to world cinema, especially by American filmmakers. Yasujirô Ozu's movies are influenced by Buddhist insights; Kurosawa's, on the contrary, are action films on bit sets with swordplay and violence. Toshiro Mifune is his main actor. Rashômon (1950) and The Seven Samurai (1954) were finantial and internationally successes. Yôjimbo(1961) (El mercenario) is sometimes considered ashis best film. It was small but greater and best considered in Japan. Unlike the massive undertaking, years of work , huge cast and budget, of the Seven Samurais, Jôjimbo was a simple, quick, and cheap film. Influenced by American films it influenced also greatly them. Kurosawa admired John Ford. He said ""My Darling Clementine is a model of what cinema shoud be"" . Also a cosmopolitan men, several of mis films were based on Shakespeare´s plays. Russian literature (Dostoyevsky) and crime fiction (Dashiell Hammet)
Yojimbo (El mercenario), is based on Dashiell Hammet´s novels ""The Glass Key"" and ""Red Harvest"". John Ford´s influence is evident throughout the movie. The Ronin tradition is the Japanese root. Detective fiction, American western and Japanese Samutay tradition.
The story is secondary to the visual part and the acting. Plot: In 1860 a nameless Ronin runs into a village taken by two rival gangs at war. The villager ares paralized by fear. The ronin, hired by the Seibei clan finds out that they intend to stab him in the back after the fight is over. He decides to have some dark fun and set both gangs to kill each other. They are beyond redemption in the eyes of the viewer. The inkeeper says it to the ronin, who, despite his appearance has a moral side. One gang has kidnapped a farmer´s wife, and he frees her using a trick; but is exposed by a thankyou note from the woman. Beaten up, he escapes with the help of the inkeeper, who then is kidnaped. Time to kill everybody. Spectacular action scenes like in a John Ford western: the wide empty main street; wind and dust; the gangs walking towards each other from opposite sides; even with pistols. The bad guys are killed. But unlike John Ford´s westerns, the hero doesn´t glow. He´s ragged, unshaven, unkempt, silent, smirking, sees everything with ironic detachment. He gets the gangs to kill each other: nothing noble. So he is an antihero. His final lines: ""It´ll be quiet in this town now"". Then frees the inkeeper with a slash and walks away with a ""Seeyah!"" leaving a town strewn with the bad guys corpses.
This changed movies. ""Sanjuro ""(1962) was a sequel. The new kind of antihero would son appear in Sergio Leone´s ""A fistful of Dollars"" (1964). The Dollar trilogy and the Spaghetti western, featuring Clint Eastwood as the new antihero. The many legal issues about copyrights were settled quietly",
197,1 May 2003,Fritz-the-Cat,10," Fun, Fresh, Exciting. Good old fashioned movie making.","Well, I can definitely see why this movie caused a huge cultural influence in America. Yojimbo is nothing short of an incredible action movie that never gets boring and never lets up. Some of the parts of this movie compare so well to modern action films that I actually thought this movie ranks in my top 10 action movies of all time.",

200,23 March 2015,TravisLikesSmoothJazz,9, Badass,"If there is one word I can use to describe this movie, it is Badass. This is another Kurasawa/Mifune collaboration, Mifune has acted in Kurasawa movies like Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood and Rashomon.",
201,13 May 2022,DarkTimesDeserveDarkMovies,10, A Must See,"If you didn't know, this film was ripped off from a famous Spaghetti Western. A unique story that life can be a flip of a coin (or stick). Kuraswa at the top of his game.",
202,19 September 2021,supertigeraki,9, A masterpiece.,"The only thing that holds this movie back is the audio quality, but otherwise, this movie is important to the history of cinema worldwide. This movie has led to creations of many famous franchises such as the fistful of dollars trilogy and Star Wars. I hope Kurosawa's films explode with popularity once Visions is out.",
203,16 February 2022,gabbypundit,7, Brill,"Great movie still holds up well today. Cinematography top notch, acting amazing from whole cast, directing on point, casting fantastic. Couldn't ask for anything better.",
204,19 June 2021,callanmcnamee,10, Film Perfection,"I love this movie so much, and why not when there's so much to love about it. For one you have a great director and a great actor in top form and in perfect sync. Kurosawa opens with a long shot following Mifune's back as he walks purposefully along the road before reaching a crossroads where he decides which direction to go by throwing a stick up in the air and seeing where it lands. There is a huge amount of raw humanity in this film along with a good dose of humour, which is important when your dealing with quite a dark plot executed with some well choreographed violence. It's Mifune's show and he dominates the screen, completely believable as this force of nature that rolls into town and decides to sort out the towns' gang rivalry problem by destroying both of the gangs. Famously remade as A Fistful of Dollars (and less famously as the Bruce Willis vehicle Last Man Standing) the influence of the American Western genre on Kurosawa is obvious although he makes it all his own, partly with the help of a great soundtrack by. Masaru Sato. If you're a fan of film-making, this is a must-see.",
