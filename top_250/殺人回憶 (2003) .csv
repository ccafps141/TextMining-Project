0,15 July 2005,WriterDave,9, The Slow Development of a Masterpiece,"This is probably the best crime thriller I've seen since ""Insomnia,"" and contains the most haunting climax of any serial killer flick since ""Seven."" But like most films reaching for greatness, this is most admirable for its striking details.",/

2,1 January 2005,AKS-6,9, Great serial killer drama,"I'm one of those people who tend to think that South Korean movies are perhaps a bit too slow-paced for my taste. Memories of Murder isn't a fast-paced film, by any means, but this time the slow pace made this movie about an investigation of serial killings so much better than 95% of its American counterparts.",e
3,24 November 2018,jadavix,8," What's Korean for ""nuance""?","The more South Korean films I see, the more I understand how it came to pass that filmmakers from that part of Asia are basically leading the world in terms of cinema in the 21st century.",v
4,19 October 2020,ferguson-6,8, the crime is solved - decades later,"Greetings again from the darkness. Between 1986 and 1991, 10 women were raped and brutally murdered in the province of Gyeong-gi outside Seoul. Considered South Korea's first serial killer case, the crime went unsolved until 2019. The case was the inspiration for writer-director Bong Joon Ho's second feature film, as was Kwang-rim Kim's play, ""Come to See Me"". Director Bong Joon Ho co-wrote the screenplay with Sung-bo Shim, and of course, went on to win an Oscar for PARASITE (2019), in addition to providing other popular features such as OKJA (2017), SNOWPIERCER (2013), and THE HOST (2006). This early film can be compared to David Fincher's ZODIAC (2007), although this one is a blend of murder mystery, crime thriller, black comedy, and political commentary.",i

7,3 February 2017,tapio_hietamaki,10, An expertly shot detective mystery,"Simply put, this is a well-made film. The story is gripping and realistic (and real), the characters are interesting and the actors engaging, the themes are explored in depth, the visuals are striking and original, the music and sound design are immersive, and the 2 hour runtime is expertly paced. It's a tense and thrilling story, a detective mystery with gray morality and no clear resolution, so it will leave you feeling unsatisfied and even scared at the world around you, but it feels real and humane.",/
8,29 November 2017,classicsoncall,8," ""This time be realistic, like in a movie.""","Starting out I didn't know how to take this movie. The senior police detective is out planting evidence, his belligerent sidekick routinely beats and tortures suspects, and people brought in for questioning admit to crimes they're completely innocent of. It's all very disorienting and doesn't make a lot of sense until about the second half of the movie when the detectives hunker down and involve themselves in routine but exhausting police work.",r
9,26 May 2004,guycorhuo,9, American thrillers should learn from Korean ones,"What a good movie.What a great work of casting. Perhaps a little bit long, but the most part the movie is enjoyable and there's no perfection without mistakes. I think i haven't ever seen before a Korean movie and if there are much of them like this one i shall become Korean movie fan. The tempo, the thrill, the development of characters, everything it has been well worked.The direction is good yet without emphatic resources, there are just two moments with a little much use of slow motion but it doesn't arrive to be an abuse of it.",w

11,10 February 2004,edoy,10, nothing prepares me for this masterpiece,"I read a review about this movie and am aware what business it made in Korea, but nothing (I mean NOTHING) prepares me for this great work. With the exception of, perhaps, SE7EN, serial-killer movie has never been this good. The story (about real-life killings of 10 women in Korea during the 1986-1991) is compelling enough, but the actors (Song Kang-ho cuts you deep even when he's silent, and his big-city partner offers emotional jolts at the end), the director (effectively plays some scenes in docu-style approach), the cinematography (a shadow creeps out in the paddy field will give you, well, creeps. big one.), and the music (haunting) are welcome bonuses.",5
12,9 December 2005,Kazombie,10, Left me in AWE!,"Being a movie buff and a director in the making, I watched this film (with English subtitles, Korean not being my mother tongue), I was completely blown away by this piece of cinematic excellence. There is not a single thing about this film that I can think of in a negative connotation. I wouldn't want to give away anything about this masterpiece. All I would like to say is that this is a film not to be missed. If I want any of my movies to be globally renowned one day, I hope it resembles ""memories of murder"" in any form whatsoever.",4
13,29 April 2007,claudio_carvalho,8, Very Realistic Movie,"In 1986, in the province of Gyunggi, in South Korea, a second young and beautiful woman is found dead, raped and tied and gagged with her underwear. Detective Park Doo-Man (Kang-ho Song) and Detective Cho Yong-koo (Roe-ha Kim), two brutal and stupid local detectives without any technique, investigate the murder using brutality and torturing the suspects, without any practical result. The Detective Seo Tae-Yoon (Sang-kyung Kim) from Seul comes to the country to help the investigations and is convinced that a serial-killer is killing the women. When a third woman is found dead in the same ""modus-operandi"", the detectives find leads of the assassin.",0
14,21 August 2006,whitecatus88,10, A Masterpiece that you cannot miss,"Beginning in the fall of 1986 and continuing for the next four years South Korea was haunted by the nation's first recorded serial killer. Preying upon women in a remote rural community the killer was both vicious and meticulous, strangling his victims with their own undergarments and leaving nothing of any use to the police investigating the crimes. The killer was never caught.",5
15,10 November 2004,wiseman-4,10, Best crime/detective film ever,"My ""one line summary"" might be too subjective (well it's just an opinion after all), but that's what kind of thought came to my mind after seeing this film. It just sucked me in and didn't let away until the ending credits appeared. I'm really not a fan of this genre which is popular in various ""detective"" TV series but this film was something exceptional. A perfectly made detective film based on a real shocking murder case in S.Korea in 80's. This is a must see Korean film for everybody and this must be a real pearl for those who love detective stories because perhaps it's the best detective film ever...",2
16,21 July 2007,kosmasp,8, Not everyone's taste,"This isn't your typical serial killer thriller. That's something that elevates this above other movies right from the beginning. But as that is, the question is if you're ready for a change? There's nothing wrong with most of the serial killer thrillers, that follow the rule book, of how to make a movie like that.",3

18,6 July 2021,Victor_Fallon,8, Entertaining procedural thriller with tons of character.,"This movie is in the tradition of hard-boiled detective stories. A rag-tag bunch of largely incompetent police detectives are on the hunt for a serial killer and blunder their way through a thick-headed investigation. Although it's based on real events, it never falls into the trap of treating its characters as accurately portrayed historical figures and instead goes full-on with digging around in the dirt of the story.",?
19,5 September 2004,rainking_es,8, Scapegoats Inc.,"Memories Of Murder is based on a true story of a south-Korean little village in which someone begins to murder young women. The Police can't catch the killer so an agent comes from Seoul to give a hand in the investigation. Soon he'll find that local police's methods are rather brutal, and that they're most interested on finding a scapegoat, someone to blame in order to ease the in tranquility of the population, than on catching the real killer (according to the real facts, they never catched the author of those crimes).",r
20,21 April 2017,Leofwine_draca,8, A work of unusual depth,"MEMORIES OF MURDER is much more than just another serial killer story; this South Korean thriller is a movie of real depth, a genre-transcending tale that shines a light on social and political issues as well as presenting that country's police force in a typically unflattering light. The main story of the tale is also interesting, as is the complex back story, and although slow-paced this is one of those films that creeps up on you to become gripping by the end. Song Kang-ho leads a great cast, but the real star here is director Bong Joon Ho, who followed this up with the equally great THE HOST and SNOWPIERCER.",e
21,4 July 2005,Atavisten,8, A good thriller,"Based on a real murder case in the 80s that now is now closed. It starts out almost as a comedy, the investigator is an amateur and resorts to tae kwondo kicks as soon as the suspects don't tell him what he want to. After a while it turns into a tense thriller.",f
22,15 March 2020,gbill-74877,8, Haunting,"At the time this film was made, the Hwaseong serial murders were unsolved, and director Bong Joon-ho holds nothing back in his searing indictment of Korean police work. Song Kang-ho delivers a fantastic performance as the local lead detective; his character manufactures evidence, pursues harebrained ideas, and tries to beat confessions out of suspects (along with his buddy, played well by Kim Roi-ha). He's oafish, inept, and immature, and so it's no wonder when he feels threatened when a smarter detective from Seoul arrives (Kim Sang-kyung). It's also pretty hilarious that when they meet, he attacks the newcomer with the leaping double-leg kick, thinking he's attempting to assault a young woman.",_
23,6 May 2003,kleaner,9," Where are you, murder?",This film is based on the true series homicide happened in the country of Korea from 1986 to 1990.,=
24,7 January 2007,Buddy-51,8, first rate police drama,"Set in 1986, ""Memories of Murder"" chronicles the first serial killer case in South Korean history. The victims are all beautiful young women whose bodies have been found raped and strangled in local fields and ditches. The initial agents who have been put on the case are two incompetent bunglers - one a dropout from college, the other a dropout from high school - who seem to have gleaned the majority of their investigative techniques from cheesy TV crime dramas. Enter Seo Tae-yoon, a forensic investigator from Seoul, who wrests control from the locals and brings some big-city know-how to the case.",t
25,20 March 2020,jtindahouse,9, A gripping film that leaves you wanting more,"After the recent success of the critically acclaimed 'Parasite' I thought I'd better check out some of Bong Joon Ho's earlier work. 'Memories of Murder' seemed to be the audience favourite so I decided to start there. Although they are quite different films, I would say I liked 'Memories of Murder' a little more. This had almost everything I like in a movie. A gripping story, little moments of understated (yet hilarious) humour (much the same as 'Parasite' heavily featured) and some beautiful cinematography. This is a brilliant film.",t
26,29 December 2022,SantiagoDM1,10," ""What did he look like? Just... ordinary.""","It's hard to encapsulate what Memories of Murder stands for as a movie, but I would say it's a sorrowful, but human experience, portraying various emotional stages throughout a harsh story which we, the audience, are going to live with the protagonists.",_
27,3 April 2007,johnny-08,7, Salinui Chueok,"This movie shows us how all countries in the world are able to make a good movies. South Korean movie ""Salinui Chueok"" (Memories of Murder) is a very good movie for everyone to watch. Movie is based on real events. Film is about one murder that happens in one little city. Local investigators are on the job in very strange circumstances (it appears that no one knows what to do when something like this happens). Local cops got help from a detective who came from the big city to solve the crime. The story is usual and this is not something new. But this movie is good because it's well directed and at the beginning you can't say how it's going to end. I can only say that I'm satisfied with the movie. You can easily imagine Hollywood stars in roles and script like this, but these actors were very good and all I can say is that this is a very pleasant surprise.",u
28,23 May 2019,keelhaul-80856,5, I was let down by the high ratings....,"I love Asian cinema, and good movies of many genres from across the world. I think Korea has some of the best new films I've seen in years, compared to the dead drivel oozing from America and Hollywood these days. Admiral: Roaring Currents is a good example, as is Outlaws, and there are several epic drug or detective dramas and serial killer thrillers like ""I Saw the Devil""--- absolute masterpieces, or at the least, excitingly different takes on modern thrillers. There are many others I can't remember by name, but you get the point. I enjoyed ""Outlaws"" the other night, which has a 7 rating, so when I saw that this film has over 8, I was thrilled. I had contemplated watching it for some time, and even got my wife to watch(she is not nearly as into foreign flicks, but enjoyed the Handmaiden and a few other horrors or thrillers from Asia.",r

The two detectives on the case are in over their heads so the captain requests help from a detective from Seoul. The three of them went about trying to find the perpetrator in three different ways, but finding him would prove to be very difficult.",

32,20 January 2020,perica-43151,8, Significant movie,"This movie by a then upcoming South Korean director, that lived up to this promise, is a cult movie in South Korea, and paints a realistic, if sorry picture of a state of one, in fact the largest ever, South Korean 80s police investigation. The movie influenced forensic science in South Korea, and is a prime example of a very impactful social criticism. South Korea has gone a long way since the 1980s, and the serial killer mystery on which this move was based has since been eventually solved some 30 odd years later.",

34,30 June 2007,Scarecrow-88,10, Memories of Murder,"Two rural detectives, their chief & a well-educated Seoul detective search for a serial killer who specifically chooses certain victims when it rains, using their own undergarments to bound and strangle them while he rapes their tied up bodies. We watch as the rural detectives, who often use rough tactics to secure their admittance of guilt from those they question, try to find the killer and how the effected the city detective is when attempts to catch him often fail. We see their dogged, weary pursuit of suspects and the exhaustive, emotional let-down when each is ruled out by one way or another. When a possible suspect emerges, and seems the ideal candidate fitting the profile of the rapist who nearly murdered one living victim(..and also requested a specific song only on the nights the murders took place, not to mention the fact that he started working at a factory right before the murders), they believe that their misery might finally end as they await a DNA semen report from America possibly pinpointing him as the murderer. But, is this suspect the murderer, and better yet, can the rural detectives keep from exploding in anger when they interrogate the suspect? It'll all come to a head when the city detective looses his suspect after falling asleep on his watch and yet another young woman is horribly butchered in a much more heinous manner during one of the town's common blackouts..the detective will take his suspect to an isolated location claiming him guilty even though the American lab results may say otherwise.",
35,23 April 2005,ElijahCSkuggs,8, korean excellence,"There are only a handful of serial killer films that actually work, and with the Korean-based ""Memories of Murder,"" it's evident that director Joon-ho Bong has done his homework.",
36,20 October 2009,Quinoa1984,10," a gripping, sad, dark-coming-but-dramatic superior serial killer flick","Bong Joon-Ho is a director that I knew a little about back in 2006 when I saw his wildly entertaining monster movie the Host. I had only seen that one film from him, but kept him in mind as someone good in the Korean film world (that is someone not Chanwook Park or Kim Ki-Duk). With this film, Memories of Murder, he's more than that now. As one goes through this tight murder mystery, based more on character and on the frustration of a clear pattern of a killer who makes it just a little too hard for the detectives to track down, you forget about the world around you or the time and just focus in on this story, of the grim line that delineates how to find a serial killer. Maybe it's because Joon-Ho knew that he was making a movie about the first ever serial killer in South Korea that he had to make it this way, about clash between inexperience and professionalism and right and wrong that's demonstrated here.",
37,21 February 2004,yonghow,9, Jarringly disturbing and haunting film,"I have long since heard of the excellence of this korean movie on koreanfilm.org, but it was only after reading the review in detail and realizing that the score was written by Taro Ishiwaro ( a well known Japanese musician who also wrote scores for Shohei Imamura and Japanese TV serials, including The Inanimate World ), and that the DOP was Kim Hyung-gu (who also shot Musa, One Fine Spring Day and Chen Kaige's Together) that it stumped on me I was indeed missing a masterpiece.",
38,5 June 2018,paulclaassen,4," Good, but not serious enough considering the theme","I must be honest, some of the things the police did made me raise an eyebrow, wondering if this is indeed the way the Korean police conduct their investigations. The police are (once again) depicted as idiots more often than not. Interesting to see in how many Korean movies this is the case.",
39,18 April 2013,BeneCumb,7, An odd crime film - simpletons amidst felonies,"It seems that apart from the events depicted and unknown at that time, the film provides a realistic overview of living habits/standards and police activities in the townships of the 1980ies South-Korea: tumbledown buildings, destitute people, brutal police etc. - very different from the 21st century Korea. The plot is constructed so that is spite of hard crimes and police violence, there are lots of dumb-and-dumber type giggling moments related to local policemen's comprehension and handling of events, intensified by a fresh look from the outsider - a cop from Seoul, the capital; all those characters are splendidly deliberated and performed. However, the events are not running smoothly and tensions are not always up high: the length could have been shorter and the ending was not up to my expectations either (true, the story is based on true events, but in films as such the viewers would expect the disclosure of a wrongdoer at least, if not more).

40,10 June 2014,SnoopyStyle,8, Gallows humor elevates serial murder mystery,It's 1986 in South Korea. Women's bodies are being found tied up. Detective Park Doo-Man is the local cop tasked to find the killer. He's a bumpkin and a brute with a slightly better sense than his other co-workers. The local force proves to be inept at such a big case. The locals coach a weak minded idiot to confess. Detective Seo Tae-yoon comes from Seoul to assist them. He suspects a missing girl is the third murder victim and they find her in the field.,

Working on the case are detectives Park Doo-man and Cho Yong-koo. Their efforts are impeded by some sloppy crime scene procedure by the police. Their methods of solving cases are also quite basic, essentially amounting to beating confessions out of suspects. All this leads to nothing and the police chief brings in a more sophisticated and intelligent detective from Seoul, Seo Tae-yoon. With his arrival the methods improve but they still don't have the killer. Then another woman is found murdered and a pattern emerges...",

46,8 September 2016,keithbrown-90195,10, Engrossing and Haunting,"A beautifully composed movie that sucks us into the investigation of a series of murders, and has us as obsessed and frustrated as our detectives. Tonally all over the map, but deliberately so, mimicking the way the investigation continually switches gears. Something that sets this apart from many cop movies, even the best ones, is the use of humor. The cops begin the movie almost as caricatures, broad and nearly comically inept. They slowly become people we identify with and feel sympathy for as we witness these murders by their side. A cop from Seoul takes over the investigation, before it slowly starts to take over him. The fact that this is all based on real life events draws us in deeper.",
