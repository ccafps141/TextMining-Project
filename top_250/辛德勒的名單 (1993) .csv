0,17 October 2005,ebiros2,10, Awesome,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.",/
1,9 September 2013,Fella_shibby,10," Bring me the heads of Hitler, Himmler, Eichmann n Mengele.","Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.

To say that this movie's overrated and one sided makes u all seem naive. This is an emotional movie that emphasizes one of the worst periods in the history of mankind. I'm a big list person so anytime there's a list of the 10, 20, 50 best(fill in the blank) I must check it out. Now usually I'll take a gander at something jus so I can try to understand y it's considered great: 2 in particular I'm not a fan of include Pulp Fiction and Annie Hall. But I digress, this movie was well worth the years it took me to finally watch, had it on the DVR since March. All of the acting is absolutely stellar. I would say I hope an amazing story told on celluloid would encourage people to treat one another better, but given the state of things in parts of the world I'll say we're a long way from that. ONE OF THE MOST GUT WRENCHING MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN",v

11,4 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," Incredibly moving and visually disturbing, Spielburg's best by far!","Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox.",6

The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination.

13,28 March 2006,Hitchcoc,10, It's About Our Humanity,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country.",4

15,16 May 2014,RossRivero99,10, Spielberg at his best,"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created.",1
16,16 June 2017,ASuiGeneris,10, Color Choice = Genius,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. ",1
17,23 October 2017,zaremskya-23761,10, Devastating,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.",/

It was horrific, black and white, and I was 15. Now, after I got myself quite a cinematographic culture, feeling the urge to identify Spieblerg's masterpiece, I came back to this movie. I knew it was rated as one of the best films generally, ever, but when I took a look at the reviews, I became really worried. Most of the 1/10 ratings bring reasonless motivations for this film's criticism. ",e
21,16 May 2017,Leofwine_draca,8, One of the ultimate anti-war movies,"SCHINDLER'S LIST is perhaps one of the ultimate anti-war movies in existence. Directed by Steven Spielberg in a naturalistic, unfussy style, it's a harsh, black and white epic that looks at the extermination of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis. Some humanity is brought to the fold by an excellent Liam Neeson who plays Oskar Schindler, a businessman who somehow found himself involved in the situation and who did the right thing. Like many Spielberg films, this is shamelessly sentimental, but then it can hope to be nothing else given the subject matter. The stirring music combines with the expert direction to make this an effortless watch, complemented by Ralph Fiennes whose role is the personification of evil.",f
22,5 August 1998,ving13,9, Excellent - Spielberg's Best,"An incredible movie.  One thing that stands out in my mind about this classic film is the great characterization of all the players due to superb acting, directing, and scripting.  Ralph Fiennes character is especially vile but at the same time human.  He may be 95% evil but to not present a stereotypical and archetypical 100% bad character makes him infinately more realistic.  Filmed in black and white, this story certainly shows the shades of gray that is the duality of man.  This is further exemplified by Schindler's own declaration of being a bad person because he could have done more good and saved more lives.",_
23,7 August 2005,lee_eisenberg,10, Possibly THE BEST example of a Best Picture winner,"I can't possibly describe with words how great ""Schindler's List"" is. You can't realize it unless you watch it. Spielberg not only makes you feel like you're in the middle of it, but you continue feeling that way for hours after watching the movie. Liam Neeson does a top-notch job as Oskar Schindler, a man caught between loyalty to his government and the desire to save over 1,000 people. Equally good is Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, whom Schindler saves from getting exterminated, and then helps Schindler save more people. And Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, a Nazi Kommandant with plans to rape a Jewish woman. Like I said, I can't possibly describe how great this movie is. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT TO UNDERSTAND IT. 11/10.",=

The public was just taking in the magnitude of the Holocaust, they might not have believed it. Fortunately for the prosecutors at Nuremberg and for history the Nazis being the anal retentives that they were, made these incredibly meticulous records which scholars and historians have sifted through and we have the whole thing incredibly documented by the perpetrator's own hand. With a fifty year perspective now and the very existence of the state of Israel questioned by those who ought to know better, Steven Spielberg has given us a work for the ages.",t

Between 1938 and 1945, the Jewish population was segregated and persecuted, culminating in the merciless slaughter of approximately six million Jews (this figure is quoted in the film, though most historical estimates vary between five and seven million). Amidst all this butchery, one man decided to make a difference, famously saving the lives of more than 1100 Jews- men, women and children who would otherwise have been killed.",t

28,2 April 2002,Anonymous_Maxine,10, Arguably Steven Spielberg's greatest film ever.,"Steven Spielberg's epic portrayal of the Nazi Holocaust is one of the most powerful films ever brought to the big screen. During production, Spielberg is said to have stood in the cold on location in Austria and cried, being partly Jewish, as he imagined the horrors that all of those people suffered during the second World War under the oppression of the Nazis. It is clear that at least some of this emotion transferred over into the film, and the end result is startlingly effective and moving. Sure, Spielberg has had several other films that have been amazing and memorable, not the least of which, obviously, are ones like Saving Private Ryan and Amistad (oh shut up, Amistad rocked¬Ö), but in my opinion, the shocking realism achieved in large part through the documentary style filmmaking gives Schindler's List the boost needed to surpass the also brutally realistic Saving Private Ryan.",r

36,8 January 2005,sol-,10, My brief review of the film,"The most amazing thing about this film is that it was not made to be an epic or an acclaimed film. Spielberg made it as a personal film for himself and other Jews affected by the Holocaust. There is nothing flashy about the film except for Neeson's bravura performance. Spielberg's usual style is invisible, and the cinematography and editing, although excellent, are not shown off to make a spectacle of the film or give it an epic feel. Yet it is still a compulsive, involving, and utterly heart-wrenchingly moving filming of a part of history that should not be forgotten. The screenplay is one of the best ever written: it captures the stories of so many Holocaust survivors but without distracting from the main story at hand. The black and white photography and editing is perfect, and John Williams provides a perfectly subtle but nice music score. The acting is simply brilliant, with Liam Neeson towering as Oskar Schindler, and Ralph Fiennes bringing out the Nazi character Amon Goeth into full flesh. And Ben Kingsley and Embeth Davidtz give off excellent performances too. The film also has a lot to say about absolute power corrupting and spiraling out of control, and such a message of the film can be applied to any time and crisis, not just the Holocaust. This is not just one of the the ten best films ever produced, but it shall remain so for years to come, because its messages in terms of power and racism are applicable in any age.",

41,20 May 2008,bobsgrock,10, Spielberg's best.,"Steven Spielberg delivers his masterpiece here in telling the very unknown story of a German Nazi Party member who became the savior for over 1100 Jews during the height of the Holocaust. This is very dark material and Spielberg was wise enough to film it in black and white obviously to emphasize the bleakness of the situation. Here all the elements come together and mesh fluidly. The acting is superb with Liam Neeson perfectly capturing the multiple emotional cycles that Schindler went through. At first, he is happy and wealthy yet struggles with the relationship to his wife. As the story progresses, he becomes more saddened and shocked at the horrific events that are taking place on Jews in the local towns of Poland. He then decides to use the immense wealth he has gathered to try and save those that worked for him in Poland before they were moved to concentration camps towards the end of WWII. This is not a happy story at all, and yet there is something so beautiful about this picture. When I first saw it, I cried at multiple scenes. Now, after seeing it for the second time, I was more taken aback and could only watch in awe as a simple German businessman did something that only a handful of human beings would have the courage to do. He went face to face with multiple SS officers, including the demented head of the camp Amon Goeth played sinisterly by Ralph Fiennes, in order to save all he can. The last hour of the film showing Schindler collect all his money together so he can pay for the Jews to move them to safety can only amaze and stun you as we watch one man risk and sacrifice all he owns for the benefit of 110 strangers he knows nothing about. Here it is all about the quality of human life and how important one person can be to so many others. This truly is one of the greatest films ever made and it is in my mind the best of the last decade. Not to be missed by anyone, Schindler's List is more than a film; it is an experience of a n event that I pray will never occur again.",

Compassion and love is the most natural state of us humans, any other emotions of hatred, rage and violence are an alteration of our very being and existence. It is most commendable of Mr. Schindler to have stuck to his natural state amidst all the violence and the preaching of extreme hatred for Jews, amidst a world war to put it best. It is a perception that rich people care the least about the poor and the suffering, but above all is God Almighty's unbeatable Law of descending good people amongst bad people, and vice versa, and here he descended an angel in the form of a rich business, the best option, for the Jews who'd been suffering hopelessly. I smiled when he said to his secretary that if the German army becomes suspicious of the incompetent works done in his factory he'd buy ammunition and weapons from some other factory and then sell it to the army to keep things in control. A masterminded person!",
44,25 April 2002,moviemachine,10, Excellent!,"""Schindler's List"" without a doubt has been one of the best movies I have ever seen. I am glad that it won a lot of Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson is an excellent in that film also. Neeson stars as a Nazi Czech/German businessman named Oskar Schindler who owns a factory and saved more than 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust. Concentration camp is a very bad place where people work on digging the dirt from sunrise to sunset. It is a sad film, but it is based on a true story and it is brilliant, too.

Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp, it is a testament to the good in all of us he bribed the Germans into giving him people to work in his factory in which they were supposed to make arms but keep them alive Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.Yes, both were very real. The Plasz√≥w labor camp was located in a southern suburb of Krak√≥w and was presided over by the real Amon G√∂th. Under G√∂th's command, many thousands of Jews were killed there, it is documented that G√∂th was every bit as cruel and psychotic as the film depicts him. Schindler's factory, Deutsche Emailewaren-Fabrik, also existed in the Krak√≥w city limits. Schindler's efforts to bring Jewish prisoners to work in his factory are also documented. There's an old saying; ""You have to spend money to make money."". Schindler was schmoozing with the local Nazi & SS officers to build a customer and contact base. He'd already made plans to open the Emailwarenfabrik factory & supply the German army with cookware but he needed to find the right people to sell his product to, IE, all the officers that frequented the restaurant. You can see him working up the chain of officers that come into the place. Schindler (at least in the film) is presented as not only very charming but also very cultured -- he orders appetizers & entrees that appear to be crowd-pleasing & converses with the Maitre'd about the right wine for his guests. At the end of the scene we see him having a drink with Oberf√ºhrer Julian Scherner, who is the highest ranking officer that enters the place -- his rank is that of a senior colonel. If Schindler is able to, at the very least, strike up a friendship with this man, then Scherner will be likely to throw business Schindler's way through the other officers under his command. Schindler's strategy pays off well; he picks up a lot of business & begins making a lot of money.",
46,11 September 2009,thinker1691,10," "" I'm afraid your quite mistaken, that is not snow, but the ashes of Human Beings ""","Too often the history of the Second World War concentrates on the massive destruction between the countries involved. It is true nearly 25 million people were killed, but the most horrendous tally in human cost was suffered by a single race and they were European Jews. Anyone who Denys this is not only a fool, but a historical moron as well. There is so much irrefutable evidence to disprove them it's simply ludicrous to try. In this film "" Schinder's List "", director Steven Spielberg lays it out cinematically for all to see. The film has so many notable qualities, it's difficult to say which illuminated it the most. The story is based on the real life of humanitarian Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who began the war as a Nazi sympathizer and profiter, but soon realized his Nazi friends were murdering millions, on behalf of the most damnable doctrine ever created. Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) plays the courageous bookkeeper who not only kept Schindeler's files, but helped him to save the lives of thousands. The heavy, Amon Goeth is played despicably evil by Ralph Fiennes. It is very interesting that during the war, ten of thousands were proud to be Nazi soldiers and SS men, yet after the war, you couldn't find two who would own up to their murderous atrocities. Still the movie has garnered so much acclaim and honor, it has become a tribute to Spielberg and his effort to remember the Hollocaust and the saddest chapter in human history. With no effort at all this has become a Classic in every sense of the word. *****",
47,7 August 2010,Loving_Silence,10, ~One of the Greatest Films of All Time~,"I know many of you, out there will disagree with me, when I say that  Schindler's List is one of the greatest film that there has ever been.  It does sound that I'm extremely overrating it, but I truly believe  that Schindler's List is up there with The Godfather and Citizen Kane I  mean everything about is so good, that its close to perfection.  The acting is brilliant, every actor does an amazing job. Liam Neeson  as Schindler is incredible, no doubt about it. He should of won an  Oscar for Best Actor. Ralph Fiennes is the one, who truly is the best  actor in the film. He plays his antagonist role as Amon Goeth, so well  that it is a travesty, he didn't win an Oscar for Best Supporting  Actor.  I'm happy though, that the Academy chose this film for Best Picture, it  was one of the best decisions they ever made. Because if this film  wasn't considered Best Picture by the Academy, I don't know which film  would be, expect maybe for The Godfather.  Steven Spielberg certainly deserved an Oscar for Best Director. It was  a smart idea for Steven Spielberg to make this film in black-white  because it made the movie more bleak, emotional, hopelessness. But you  see small patches of color -- A candle and a child's coat bringing the  evilness of the tragedy into a agonizing focus.  There's no doubt about it, this film will be a classic in decades, even  hundreds of years to come in cinema. This film is without a doubt, the  Best film that Spielberg has ever made. With many other Steven  Spielberg's classics like Jurassic Park,Jaws,E.T, Raider of the Lost  Ark, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Schindler's List will always be Steven  Spielberg's most finest, important film. He blends his humanism to the  tragic horror of the Holocaust to create an emotional masterpiece.  10/10 Absolutely Recommended!",
48,15 May 2010,Samiam3,10, My favourite movie,"Oskar Schindler was a German Entrepreneur who came to Poland during the Nazi occupation to start a new business. He wanted to hire Jewish labor because they were cheaper than Polish. For a while, a good number of Jews went to work in Schinder's factories, making pots and pans for the German economy. Eventually they were rounded up by Nazi Comander Amon Goeth and put in the concentration camps. Those who were not fit to do back- breaking slave labor were put in the gas chamber. Oscar Schinder, who was in fact a Nazi supporter, slowly became empathetic after watching the cruelty to these harmless people. Using all the money he made from the business, he purchased 1,100 Jews from the Nazis, and put them back to work in his factory, under good conditions until the war was over. Not long after the war ended, Amon Goeth was executed for his crimes against humanity, and Schindler unfortunately never ran a successful business again, but today the descendants of the Jews he saved number, tens of thousands.",

Sure today he has films like Munich and Saving Private Ryan under his belt so Spielberg making a non kid-friendly film isn't very strange to us, but back then it was unheard of.

The film is based on the novel Schindler's Ark, which itself was based on the life of Oscar Schindler who saved over 1,000 Jews during the Holocaust. Oscar Schindler was played by Liam Neeson, and his performance was excellent. The shows that Schindler himself was faulted character himself, he was a member of the Nazi, he was a war-profiteer, a womaniser and bribed officials. He did however have a sense of humanity and could not allow innocent people die. He uses his influence and money to save them and has to battle Nazi officials to do this. Ralph Fiennes was also performed brilliantly as Amon Goth, a senior Nazi who was sent to help organisation the Final Solution. Goth was portrayed a Sadistic murderer who enjoyed randomly killing Jews and having sexual affairs. It was also shown that Schindler had to work with Goth to save as many Jews as he did.",
55,5 August 2008,jzappa,10, One of the All-Time Quintessential American Films,"Steven Spielberg's versatility can no longer be a question once you have seen Schindler's List, one of the all-time quintessential American films. Where his most commercially successful films have been fantasies with enormous suspension of disbelief and elements of childlike wonder, Schindler's List is unremittingly real, not only in its story and subject matter but in its portrayal of a horrific point in history. One of the most unforgettable sequences I have ever seen in a movie is the SS clearing the Krakow ghetto, sending in hundreds of troops to empty the cramped rooms and shoot anyone who protests, does not cooperate, elderly or infirmed, or for no reason at all. The strange unpredictability of the sequence is masterful, such as the heartbreaking point during when the lone boy desperately tries to find a place to hide. Or when one SS officer plays a piano and carries on a nonchalant discussion while machine guns massacre hiding tenants. As Oskar Schindler, perhaps Liam Neeson's greatest role, watches the carnage from the hills overlooking the area, and is profoundly affected, during one of the most oft-revered employments of color technique in contemporary cinema.",

Even though my own family survived the war as Polish Catholics, they too still have scars to last more than a lifetime. My one problem with Steven Spielberg is that it's not graphic enough. The war was terrible and almost everybody in Poland was scarred as well. Schindler's List is a difficult film for adults to watch because it is graphic, brutal but all wars both graphic and brutal. Oskar Schindler wasn't so much hero or saint but he was a human being who did an incredible thing by saving thousands. There are others out there who did their part like Raoul Wallenberg.

With the notable exceptions of Duel and Jaws this wasn't necessarily an unfair assessment. While his vision was unerringly on the pulse of the mainstream, it rarely had any edge whatsoever.

95,17 June 2002,chrisbrown6453,8, Steven Spielberg finally pulled it all together in one film to please the adult public and the Academy Awards voters alike.,"Schindler's List did quite well at the box office, while it guaranteed the maker his first Oscar for directing. Jane Campion edged him out for several of the year-end awards given by critics groups, but the Academy put him at the top of their ""A"" list for this effort. 1993 was quite a year for Spielberg. JURASSIC PARK went goofy worldwide, eclipsing yet another Spielberg megabuck effort, E.T. Schindler's List may never quite reach the same box-office stratosphere, but Spielberg can certainly be most pleased and proud of this film. Shot in glorious black and white, it is the heart-wrenching story of a group of Jews condemned to the Krakow Ghetto who are saved by a most unlikely guardian angel, a German businessman named Oskar Schindler. Herr Schindler is, at first, only interested in these people as cheap labor that can further enhance his bank account, but somewhere along the way he gains a measure of humanity and is soon taking substantial risks for ""his"" Jews. The movie isn't precisely clear about why this drastic character change takes place, but that hardly matters. The inherent drama of the turbulent situation carries us along for the full three hours, and you'll be hard-pressed not to shed a few tears during the journey. Liam Neeson does a stalwart job of filling the Schindler shoes, not skimping on the little character details while looming larger than life. It has been noted that Neeson has the presence of an old-fashioned movie star and as Schindler, he shows that he knows what to do with it. The real-life Schindler was described as a cross between Curt Jurgens and George Sanders.",

97,19 April 2000,DennisLittrell,9, Lest we forget...,"Steven Spielberg on the holocaust. Naturally the kids are cute even as they are diving into the excrement-filled waters of the latrine to hide from the Nazis... Schindler, played believably by big, handsome Liam Neeson (he was the guy Whoopi Goldberg was panting over at the Oscars last month) is a sweet womanizer who exploits Jewish labor in his factories and then feels guilty about it and ends up saving the lives of eleven hundred. Ben Kingsley plays his accountant with precision and his usual subdued intensity. We have again all the Nazi horror, in some ways worst than ever, and rightly so. Here we see a lot of the random shooting of people. The Nazis just use them for target practice or blow their brains out just to be doing something. The cattle cars are there and the gas ovens and the Nazi psychopaths and all the rest of it, although Spielberg adds some touches like Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi who kept a Jewish woman he was interested in but couldn't love or even rape, but could only beat. And among the guards who are herding the Jews along are a couple who smile at the kids, as though Spielberg is saying, 'here is this juxtaposition: the horror of the most degraded and inhuman acts known to humankind, but look even the monsters think the kids are cute.'",

Set in the Nazi German concentration camps of World War II, filled with thousands of innocent Jewish people, where greedy, unsuccessful businessman Oskar Schindler (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Liam Neeson) hoping to make profit from the Jewish slave labour manufacturing. Later we are introduced to one of the lead villains, overseeing the progress of the camp, the evil Amon Goeth (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ralph Fiennes). As time goes by, more and more Jews are trying to escape capture, torture and death by the Nazis, Oskar sees how much pain and suffering these innocent souls are going through, and starts having changes in heart. So with the help of friend and almost colleague Itzhak Stern (BAFTA nominated Sir Ben Kingsley) they begin to type a list (hence the title) for all the Jews he can afford to buy and take away to another camp for a new manufacturing business. He manages to ""evacuate"" approximately 1,100 victims, and he becomes the unlikely hero (after not doing much earlier) by releasing all of them. Also starring Caroline Goodall as Emilie Schindler, Jonathan Sagall as Poldek Pfefferberg, Embeth Davidtz as Helen Hirsch and Malgoscha Gebel as Victoria Klonowska. There are horrific and memorable moments of realistic suffering, torture and death, a hideous real villain and a great unlikely real hero, moments of colour (i.e. the beginning, the girl with the red coat, and the ending) and a teary ending with many survivors paying their respects at Schindler's grave.

But for whatever reason, we do have them, and the Holocaust is one of the darkest periods in our existence as human beings.  There certainly are other dark times but this one is the most talked about and famous.  And before I saw this film, I knew the Holocaust was horrible, but when you can put visuals to the words, it gives you a whole new appreciation and understanding of what is one disgusting display of inhumanity towards a people.

The extermination of a people was underway. And in these circumstances a hero was made. For Schindler it was no longer about making money. It was about saving Jews. His Jews. Amidst the darkness of the most unspeakable of horror there was a small light shining bright. Yes, the number of those who were saved pales in comparison to the number of those lost.

It's a very important thing to consider when looking at some of the criticisms levelled at this great film. There have been documentaries that have attempted to capture the atrocities of the Holocaust but even so none come close to the unflinching and systematic mass murder of the event. Schindler's List doesn't attempt to provide an substantial and unbiased view of it. It is a story about one man in particular and his absolute good. ",
105,10 March 2015,sickofenjoyingmyself,10, Magnificent and Unforgettable masterpiece,"I can't believe I waited until the age of 29 years old to finally watch a movie I had been planning to view for years but never got around to. I knew that the story would exert an emotional toll on me but I finally found my chance to watch it through last week and it was worth the wait. This is magnificent and emotional viewing. Based on an inspiring true story that is enough to restore one's faith in mankind. The acting all round is incredible. Neeson is understated - although I have read that he wasn't entirely happy with his performance in hindsight. Kingsley was even more understated. Ralph Fiennes was simply incredible. Totally twisted, believably merciless - he portrays exactly what you would expect of a debauched, unapologetic and excessive Nazi. The overall mood is extremely sad. Some of the scenes that depicted actual events that happened in our world, by human beings - are utterly gut wrenching, heartless and terrifying. The horror of the mass shower scene was an unforgettable experience - by not showing what you expected to see - it seemed to create even more empathy with the helpless fear of the situation. To tackle such historical atrocity is a monumental task indeed. Schindler's list shows us every side to the events that shook, and still continue to shake the world. The horror, the senselessness, the bravery, the hope, the fear, the courage, the evil. The greatest purpose of all that this exceptional movie serves - we must never forget what happened. There are some things that can never be forgotten or forgiven. And there are some people, like Oskar Schindler, whose actions carry a weight that will never be forgotten by all of those who's lives were saved. A remarkable movie about an inspirational man.",
106,31 March 2012,leplatypus,10, German's list is shamefully short (cinematheque),"This movie is about ordinary people showing the best of humanity or unfortunately the worse. As my favorite writer, PKD, said holocaust wasn't only Hitler and his pals but began foremost with those thousands of anonymous Germans, Polish, Ukrainians, French that operated the camps, the trains, opened the doors and close them, brought the lethal gas and so on. Everyone would contribute even small in the process was as guilty as their original planners. Shoah is about individual morals and value and it was up to every one to choose the path to be a killer or a righteous. The movie is brilliant for that because you see that thousands of anonymous killers and one brave soul who repents. Sure, it's greed that leads Oskar to those families but it's their suffering that makes him change. From that point of view, i don't think that the girl who wore red is an error as other people think because she symbolizes his borderline. From this moment, Oskar is touched and is on duty: Liam becomes really irresistible of empathy and courage. Next, some french media consider a bigger flaw that the women's convoy is only lead to shower and not death chambers. Well, that's the proof that they haven't understood Spielberg's sensibility: he doesn't direct a documentary but as always, a movie about hope, about this little flame that still burns in the darkest hours. So he didn't have to show those woman dying as well as he could mix a lot of atrocities that surely hasn't all happened in the real Schindler's story but happens really during the war: killing disabled, killing for fun, etc... In that way, Fiennes and Liam delivers unforgettable performances, the one as an unforgettable pit of darkness and the other as a force of life. That's why my eyes were full of tears at the end because to see this strong oak finally crumble was too much. ",

Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Oskar Schindler is a German Businessman who hires Jewish people in Germany to work in his factory during World War II. During the tenure, Schindler realizes that the Jews are brutally abused, tortured, misbehaved and murdered. As the ill-treatment on Jews, Schindler tries to help these people with his wealth, powerful friends. Later when Germany untimely surrenders , Schindler is forced to quit but he leaves behind wonderful memories of helping the Jews. The film was a masterpiece. The astounding piece of work could only be achieved by Steven Spielberg. The great director not only tells emotional story about the cruelty suffered by the Jews but also the showcases that money is not everything. The way a business tycoon helps his workers despite the ill-treatment they were suffering was eye-catching. Though the running time of the film was 3 hours but it will keep you engrossed . Direction was fantabulous. Cinematography was jaw-dropping. Same goes with the sets. Talking about performance, Liam Nesson essays the role of Schindler with T. The actor not looks good but comes up with a brave performance. In supporting , Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes acted their part with equal justice. So overall, I was completely moved by the film.

It does a great job making us care for Schindler and I can tell that Spielberg really cared for him and his actions. It's a very powerful film and the fact that this was based on a true story only strengthens the emotional power. The fact that it was shot in black and white undoubtedly gives it more power and emotion. Saying this movie was expertly shot would be an understatement. I've never seen a film shot better then this.

This film is not clich√© or heartwarming. The truth is that if you are going to make a film about something as horrifying and terrible as The Holocaust, you have to be brutal. And Spielberg was necessarily brutal. What's depicted in this film is extremely upsetting, and I wish not go into detail fear I upset myself and furthermore upset you. It's not gory or bloody like a war film, (although there are some scenes that boarder on gory), but rather, as you may have guessed, emotionally brutal. I am not a Jewish individual, but I can honestly say, just as a human being, this film upsets me.

Then again, Scorsese passed on the project because he felt only a Jewish filmmaker could get it right (plus, he was still recovering from the controversy surrounding The Last Temptation of Christ), Billy Wilder said he was too old (but he did contribute to a first draft of the screenplay) and Roman Polanski stated he just wasn't ready to face his childhood nightmares yet (he did nine years later with The Pianist).

Filmed in Black and white (a very good decision from Spielberg) and as grand as Hollywood's most classic works, Schindler's List claims itself at the top of 90's filmmaking. All three leads are magnificent, especially Fiennes in his most well acted role yet. The depiction of the concentration camps is raw and gritty, not glazed over and stylized.

As time went on, he saw the demise of the Jewish to Nazi rule and took a stand to save as many as he could. He ended up saving 1,100 Jews and he is considered, to this day, a savior. Neeson's transformation throughout the course of the film from Nazi supporter to Savior of the People is a poignant journey of soul searching. When you watch the piece, you may wonder, ""Is he changing because he's out of money? Does money truly matter at this point anymore? I think many would agree that Schindler had an awakening and that saving the people and himself was his destiny. He found peace with himself and with God. ",

He may have done some bad movies, but his resume is chalkful of some of the most timeless things to every lay your eyes on. Enter Schindler's List: the true story of a crude nazi-party member (played here by Liam Neeson) that saved the lives of over a thousand Jews during the Holocaust. Spielberg outdoes himself using every trick up his sleeve and more, to the max. The movie is black and white to get an old feeling and the filming in general is dynamic and hauntingly real. So it is a feast for your eyes. The acting is uncanny with everything being character driven, which are the best movies to see. As a brutal Holocaust film, it is difficult to watch. As a movie about a bold hero, it is a major triumph. Many different emotions are felt at very high degrees, happy and sad. Very few movies made this well that can carry you through over 3 hours can make you truly sad and truly happy by the end as a major accomplishment. None of these few movies are Spielberg's. Yeah ET and Indiana Jones were masterpieces, but a funny-looking alien and an invincible archaeologist can't be taken as seriously and, simply, aren't quite as good. With the general movie-making being superior, its seriousness sets it apart from Spielberg's other classics. Because this is Spielberg's best, it is evident that this would be one of cinema's best in general. Top 20, heck, top 10!

166,17 March 2002,Lee-107,10, History in Vivid Hues,"After the release of 'Saving Private Ryan', Spielberg, in one of his interviews said that the purpose of a ""war"" film was to disenchant people from war, to show it so horrifyingly that no one would ever want a repetition of what happened in WWI and WWII. Spielberg's purpose in 'Schindler's List' which he made five years before 'SPR' is much the same. With calculated detail he drives home the horrors of war constantly. A third World War may not have the Nazis but there will always be someone who will be equally brainwashed and equally cruel as the Nazis were to the Jews. I've seen war films before(the series 'Escape from Sobibor' which I think was the most vivid), but Spielberg manages to show war in 'Schindler's List' with such a  menacing tenacity that you actually have to look away from the screen in some of the scenes. The story of Oskar Schindler starts in a very film noir style(especially the sequence of him in the bar), giving us the impression of him as a typical smooth-talking manipulative lady's man. But this is a very initial primary impression of a man who might be manipulative and a womanizer but whose humanity totally overshadows any of his vices. Liam Neeson is truly classic and magnificent in his portrayal of Schindler. His facial expressions(when he's on horseback, staring as a whole town is driven to ruins because of the Nazi atrocities), his whole demeanor, his voice, make Schindler one of the best characters ever portrayed by an actor. Liam Neeson deserved an Academy Award that year as much as Tom Hanks for 'Philadelphia' did. Sometimes it's a good idea to have a tie for the Oscar and give the Award to both! Because one actor's performance is just as good and commendable as the other's, especially when you have an actor like Neeson playing so complex a character as Oskar Schindler... Ralph Fiennes(who is so spectacular in 'The English Patient'), also gives a charged performance as Amon Goeth. His feelings for Helen, the Jewish girl who works for him are portrayed sensitively.",

It tells you the story of the time of holocaust during World War II and how one businessman Oscar Schindler (played by terrific Liam Nesson) becomes concerned about his Jewish work force after witnessing the massacre. It's black and white except the one last scene because there was no point of using colors till that point. It shows we the people can be nice and can be evil without giving a thought to the reason. It is as graphic as it can be while showcasing the horrors of war. You need to be really stone hearted if not moved by this emotional, horrific portrayal of war times. Ralph Fiennes as ruthless German and Ben Kingsley as Jewish business manager of Schindler's factory give knock out performances. But the movie belongs to legendary director Steven Spielberg's unmatched skills of directing the whole story with such uniqueness and conviction that is hard to believe.

The acting is phenomenal and Spielberg may be rightly accused of being manipulative, but any film that can move 80% of an audience (I attended an opening night showing) to tears is incredible. There's a technical kudo: review the tracking shot Spielberg used when the Nazis invade the city (Schindler's on horseback on a date)... an astonishing achievement (superior to famous 1962's The Longest Day tracking scene...). I also love some of our foreign friends' opinions vis-a-vis our treatment of Indians, the Ludlow Massacre, etc. (inarguably horrible chapters in U.S. history). But that's akin to saying a British film stinks thanks to the Crusades. This is an outstanding film and certain scenes still resonate in my head (the child in the latrine, Schindler's end-of-film breakdown... or how I never could seem to pronounce Ralph, Rafe... Raphe... Finney... Finez... oh, forget it). This rates a 10++++ (and I hated 1941 and had a difficult time with Empire of the Sun...)",

This film we have here runs for over 3 hours and I was lucky enough today to catch it on the big theater screen on the occasion of a very special day here in Germany. And what can I say. It was a feast. If that is an appropriate term given the heavy subject. I already wrote in the title of my review that this is of course a movie about the Holocaust. And it does not even try to hide the horrible deeds done by the perpetrators back then. Which means you have several occasions where you see people being shot in the head from the nearest distance and killed in cold blood for what their religion is. But it is also an uplifting movie as the man in the middle of it is Oskar Schindler, a manufacturer who saved more than a thousand Jewish lives during these perhaps darkest days in German (global) history. He is played by Liam Neeson and this is also his career-defining performance today without a doubt. Ralph Fiennes was around the age of 30 when he played the main antagonist here, Amon G√∂th, and Ben Kingsley, already an Oscar winner back then, is also on board and he looks so different compared to how he looks today, almost older you could say.",

To bring a story like this to the screen is nothing short of magnificent. It would be difficult to single out a particular actor for their contributions, since the film is so cohesive and unified. You are immediately drawn into the action, you are watching the events unfold as if you were there. Liam Neeson's performance as Schindler is dynamic and compelling. At first he appears the opportunist and war profiteer, but his growth through the film lets you feel his compassion. Ben Kingsley's quiet and steady demeanor throughout the film compliments Neeson's. Ralph Fiennes is the quintessential Nazi camp commandant, unhappy to be where he is, ruthless in his orders, and totally without compassion. He is a soulless man who cannot feel love or hate, simply disdain for the Jews, as if they were cattle. There are so many scenes in this film that speak to your soul, but perhaps the most important line in the film occurs near the end. ""If you save one life, in time you save the world."" The violence and cruelty of the film make it unsuitable for those under 14, and between 14 and 17, I would use sound judgment. A definite collectors item, and if they haven't shown this to your teens in high school, they ought to. This is a reminder of the inhumanity man can reach if he has nothing to stop him.",

Liam Neeson acting so also excellent he really played the role. Oskar Schindler is a member of the Nazi party who is a womanizer and a war profiteer. He character changes very much because he knows what the Germans are trying to due the Jews. The scene where the Germans remove the Jews from the Ghetto is disturbing and well directed.

It's about the holocaust and it focuses on a man named Oskar Schindler who was a NAZI during World War 2 and came to feel compassion for Jews and saved some of them from being killed in the holocaust. It is mainly a movie to show the horrible reality of the holocaust to educate people about it. It is mostly in black and white which is a very unusual and wonderful thing. Color in it includes the red dress of a little girl that is killed and at the end. The dress is seen as red when the girl is walking outside and when she is dead with everything else in those shots in black and white. The movie has a lot of very disturbing scenes.

There are many interesting stories about the holocaust and WWII, and I wonder what attracted Spielberg to Schindler's story so much. Well, if you saw the film you can see that what Spielberg and Schindler have in common is money and ambition. Spielberg in my point of view is a great producer/business man. He knows how to make money (even for the Holocaust). I believe that is why Spielberg's so attracted to Schindler's character. Don't get me wrong, Spielberg has also values as well, and it is said that most of what the film has earned Spielberg donated to the Holocaust foundation. Spielberg is a franchise but I get the feeling that he cares. So in parallel to Schindler's character that evolves through the film, Spielberg uses the money he earns to make some good.",

Neeson's central performance is solid, if unspectacular - he is overshadowed by Fiennes, who shows a frightening ability to capture unspectacular and always human face of evil - but his somewhat stolid performance may simply reflect a trait that allowed Schindler to dupe the Nazis.

Instead of films like, The Piano where the world consists of clearly good or German (stereotype dumb, cruel), Schindler's List shows people who are trapped in war and loose their way. Whether because they are being persecuted, part of the German army or civilians who try to survive. Schindler's List doesn't judge and doesn't need to. A fairly straight account is given from the live and thoughts of the main characters. Emotional stress is sometimes evoked by shots in black- and-white: no overacting needed.

That is why i suggest the visions of Keneally, spielberg and oskar schindler. this movie is so magnificent from here on out all my grades will go down in perspective. 12 oscar noms, 7 wins (including picture and director), a host of other accolades, all amply deserved. there is just so much to admire: the mix of large scale storytelling with countless smaller story arcs (kudos to  Steven Zaillian's oscar winning adapation of keneally's wondrous novel), hundreds of amazing and daring cinematic touches (set design, cinematography, and editing all also picked up statues) dozens upon dozens of bravura performances, monolithic sets with literal casts of thousands, impressive historical accuracy, the list is near endless, a series of beauties rising into ultimate truth: a film with a soul. perhaps the powerful beauty of this film is that spielberg does not put a hollywood polish on the fact that oskar schindler was a comprised man yet capable of tremendous goodness. in some ways this can be seen as spielberg's first mature film and it's entirely appropriate that this was the first time he collected an oscar after 5 noms. the journalist in me wants to document all the details in this well earned victory, but the humanist in me just wants to thanks everyone involved for the fact it exists. whatever else may be wrong with our planet we can still find hope in the fact that men like schindler are remembered and revered and honored in such an celebrated and immensely popular film. if my words can make you see a film or work for peace, let this one be the one, let now be the time.",

In a way it is troubling to say this movie is great and is a favorite because of the terrific horror of the subject but Speilberg makes it a poignant memorial for those who lived through the holocaust and a reminder to those who were too young to have remembered that these atrocities did happen and such hatred should never present itself again. 10 of 10,

Spielberg appropriately decided to make the film in black and white, which gives the film a documentary-like quality. It also allowed him to make effective use of occasional glimpses of color. John Williams again proves his ability to come up with an appropriate soundtrack for any type of film.

Those renting the DVD just to have a fun time would be best to look elsewhere.

216,16 September 2008,kyle-cruse,8, Amazing and inspiring,"Currently hailed as one of the top ten films of all time, ""Schindler's List"" remains an amazing story depicting the persecution of the Jews during the Holocaust. If you ask me, the film is not truly about the Jews themselves. For me, the main part of this film deals with the man Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson, in what is possibly his best role) and the life change he endures by deciding to help out the Jews. He begins as a selfish man using the Jews to work for him so he can make a profit. As a result, he pays to save the Jews from Hitler's persecution so he can use them to work for him instead. A large number of Jews end up on his list (the list of the title) and come to work for him. By the end, however, he sees what he has done for them and wishes he had been less selfish and could have spent more of his money (which he now sees as worthless) to save the lives of more of the Jews. The scene in which he realizes this is my personal favorite scene of the film. This is where the movie is at. It makes us all wish we could do more to help. At over three hours long, this film can prove to be a bit long and slow at times, which is really the only reason I cannot call it perfect. Nevertheless, everything about the movie is perfectly well done. The depictions are very realistic and the acting is brilliant. Spielberg pulls it off once again. Hard to say if this should be the Best Picture of 1993, though. ""The Fugitive"" is my personal favorite movie and I would have liked that to win. Of course, it is a film like ""Schindler's List"" that truly deserves a Best Picture Oscar. Not one of the top ten of all time for me, but a must see for all.",

218,6 November 2016,PetarNeo,10, Heartbreaking story,"Story of Oskar Schindler told by one of he greatest directors Spielberg is probably one of the most memorable things ever shown on screens. Schindler is war opportunist that saw a way to make a profit in employing Jews but later on chose the path of saving them from executions. Throughout movie you are constantly loaded with horror that was put upon Jewish people in the WWII. Oskar met with Stern, Jewish accountant, to help him deal with all paper work and over period of time got a real friendly and cared for him as friend. After almost two hours of pure torture, horror, sadness and pain there come a hope as Oskar wan't to save as much as possible Jews from being sent to Auschwitz and he even bribes others to help him execute plan. After train with men came it was surreal but seemed like it will happen and then it did train with women was sent by mistake to Auschwitz and it kept breaking heart from moment to moment with a great of pain and horror. After realizing that Oskar went everywhere and demanded them back and thankfully he managed to correct that. SS surrenders and factory scene is so heartfelt and satisfying. Oskar was forced to leave and in his way to car he just emotionally falls apart and starts to talk about saving even more Jews. Final scene are incredible and full of emotions, happiness and at the same time pain. All three of most memorable characters played by Neeson, Fiennes and Kingsley are absolutely magnificent.

222,15 June 2013,rsabnis1,10, Spielberg : The Creative Genius....Hats off !,"Schindler's List (1993), directed by the most acclaimed director Steven Spielberg is the most touching and fascinating movie Hollywood ever witnessed. The movie has Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes playing the key roles in the film. Spielberg demonstrates his creative genius by taking the audience back into the era regarded as the worst period in the history of mankind, the Holocaust. The protagonist Oskar Schindler, played quite beautifully by Liam Neeson is a true Nazi gentleman having a taste for women, liquor and money. A sense of confidence is reflected in the eyes of Oskar as he goes on to establish an enterprise having Jews as the manual labourers. It was the time when Jew labour was considered to be the cheapest and it seemed perfect for Oskar to make a successful business. He appoints a Jew manager by the name Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) who once ran a factory in the Cracow ghetto. Stern does the job of recruiting Jew labour while Schindler takes care of the flamboyance (that is what he claims he is good at). The work of running a labour camp in Pasz√≥w is entrusted to Amon Goeth, a ruthless Nazi general. The Krakow ghetto is liquidated and numerous Jews are sent to allocate in the labour camps where innocent Jews are shot in cold blood by Amon for no reason and just to fulfill his immoral satisfaction. As the film progresses, a gradual change in Oskar Schindler takes place. The person who used to think only about his enterprise and the profits associated with it starts feeling a concern and a sense of sadness for the devastated Jews. The audience can literally sense the humanitarian nature evolved in Oskar Schindler. The name 'Schindler's List' pertaining to the list which Oskar prepares to bring in thousands of Jews into his company thereby freeing them from the clutches of Amon. Spielberg creates an artistic feel as the movie is shot in black and white and the viewer gets himself time-travelled in the past. The movie ends with Schindler saving more than thousand Jews thus stopping paving a way for another world. The film has a very pertinent dialogue quoted by Stern. He says ""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire"". A Big salute to Spielberg and this masterpiece... Nudity: Yes Kissing: Mild Foul Language: No Blood and Gore:Yes",

The buzz about this film was astounding. Fresh from directing the summer 1993 box office smash, Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg was about to completely abandon the famous popcorn movie for which he was so well known to take on one of the darkest chapters of the 20th century, the holocaust.

228,1 December 2016,cdjh-81125,10," A Harrowing Tale of Heroism, Loss and Naivety","Steven Spielbergs ""Schindlers List"" is all but considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time and I can hardly disagree with such a statement because this is an incredible film that isn't always easy to watch but is the peak of writing, directing and acting. Liam Neeson and Oskar Schindler gives the greatest performance of his entire career in this film, Neeson brings a complexity to his character and a captivating nature to Schindler, Spielberg doesn't try to paint Schindler as a hero he builds him up as a man in an impossible situation trying to complete a mission he believes in and he has some truly amazing scenes with his ""power"" monologue being possibly one of my all time favourite movie moments. Neeson also has some truly astonishing scenes with Ralph Fiennes who is absolutely incredible in this movie not only is he a completely terrifying presence but Fiennes is able to turn him into a sick human being which makes him much more interesting to watch. Like I said this film is a hard watch at times but that's ultimately one of the films greatest strengths, that it refuses to glorify the holocaust and this film has some truly disgusting moments that gives you a hint at the naive nature of humans themselves. Of course John Williams scored this film and he composed one of his finest achievements for this film. Spielberg added a very personal touch to this film with the know iconic girl in the red coat, it's a moment that is chilling to begin with but almost goes completely over your head afterwards but it's truly horrifying when it comes back later on and gives you an impression that truly nobody was safe from the grip of the Nazis. While Neeson was the one who turned Schindler into such a captivating protagonist it was also the excellent writing that made his character worth watching, he at first comes across as a complete bastard but once he gradually changes his ways it feels earned and you understand the heartbreak that Schindler goes through when he begins to realise that he may not have done enough. This film is very iconic for the fact that it was completely shot in Black and White and that's because it works so well, it gives the film and documentary style that makes it feel real. ",
229,3 November 2017,kitsuyuutsu,8, Watch and decide for yourself...,"There are a lot of negative reviews on here... Most of those focus on the fact that Nazis weren't as bad as how they depict them. I suppose that's a matter of opinion. And, as we know, opinions are like assholes, everyone's got one. Honestly, the fact that they exterminated so many people (and not just Jews) because they felt them to be ""inferior"" doesn't make Nazis all sunshine and rainbows. Were they an efficient society? Yes. Did that make them superior to people of other faiths or races? No. No matter how you look at it, everyone has their own definition of good and evil and levels thereof. It all depends on your point of view. And how Spielberg views exactly how evil he felt the Nazis were should not be the sole basis of a movie review. My apologies to those who think otherwise. Now, as for the movie itself, it is a bit dark and depressing. But then again, the real life events weren't like a Club Med vacation. If you know anything about this particular period of time, you shouldn't expect cheerful. If that's what you want, go watch something else. My son watched this in history class in high school (I had to sign a permission slip because of the nudity and content). When he saw it was on one of the movie channels a year later, he told me I should watch it, that it was such a good movie. Now... my kid loves video games and Pokemon. That's pretty much it. He hates to read and hates historical anything. So when he said it was good and I should watch it, I knew I had to see it. I must admit, I was engrossed from the beginning. I had never heard of Oskar Schindler before this movie (when I was in high school, they didn't delve much into WWII) and I found his story fascinating. He risked a lot to save the lives of a lot of people. Whether or not he profited from this financially or not is kind of irrelevant. What's most important is that he wanted to save lives when the rest of the Nazis wanted to kill them all off. And the very fact that these people, who are shown at the end honoring his grave, shows me they held him in high regard, which I found moving. And I'm not easily moved. From an artist aspect, I think this was very well done. The use of black and white was quite appropriate for the content and also allowed for the few splashes of color to help the viewer focus on something important you may not have noticed otherwise, like the little girl in the red coat. As for people who complained about Spielberg... You may not think this his best movie or some sappy piece of fluff he cranked out. For those who felt that way, I'd like to ask that you go read some of the trivia items. He doesn't get a dime from this movie. He wants everything he could get donated. Mind you, he could have just donated a chunk of money, but this was obviously something he felt strongly about. I consider that to be more than admirable.",

Here, Spielberg weaves in the tragedies of the holocaust with an engaging story, balancing both perfectly, delivering enough plot to make you wonder what will happen next, and enough tragedy to make you appreciate what you have now. While there is much that is done to perfection in SL, it is the visuals that are the most memorable. Kaminski's spot on cinematography and the choice to shoot this in black and white brings frame after frame of picture perfect visuals, reminiscent of classics such as Casablanca. In addition to that, the performances are memorable for almost every performer. Neeson has the perfect persona for B&W and delivers a Oscar caliber performance, along with Kingsley and Fiennes. And lastly, and certainly not least, the production value here is amazing. They really brought this time alive with hundreds if not thousands of extras and sets. It is a tragedy that the Holocaust ever happened, but it is a godsend that Spielberg made this film. It is one everyone should see.",

The technical wizardry and stark reality of this picture alone blow the great classics (Graduate, Casablanca, On The Waterfront) out of the water. Undeniably affecting historical drama has never been more fully realized and displayed in its nakedness like it is here.  Steven Spielberg richly deserves life-long accolades for creating this film.  His choice of b&w cinematography is brilliant.  Every tear, gunshot, death, laugh and cry are all fully realized.

I gave it a 10 because for one reason, it grabs people's attention and makes you think about the Holocaust and what the Jew's and other people went through during that horrible time. Another reason is because it shows what a great sacrifice a man made to save a bunch of people that he didn't know. It also takes you inside the Holocust and the terrible things those people went through like having to strip naked in front of people, then have their heads shaved, and be forced to do hard labor with little or no food until they were too weak to work and were sent to the gas chambers. I would recommend this film for anyone over the age of 13 because of all the realistic violence, language, strong nudity and sexual activity.

It was managed by a Jewish man, Itzchak Stern, and populated hundreds of working Jews. One day, the workers and the living Jews in the ghetto were overruled by invading Nazis, led by Amon Goeth. They were evacuated and taken to a concentration camp near the ghetto. Devastated by the loss of workers, Schindler demanded to Goeth that his workers be released immediately. But not so; Goeth told Schindler that the Jews were to remain in the camp. Determined, and self-willed, Schindler opened a business near the camp, and made a list of Jews that could work there. The list was only meant for a couple hundreds, but eventually became a list with one thousand and eleven Jew names on it. The Jews were shipped out, and worked until the end of the war. Afterwards, at midnight the day World War II was strictly declared over, Stern and some friends made a letter of evidence that Schindler was innocent, and a ring out of a Jew's tooth, with the words ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"" inscribed on the side. It was at exact moment that Schindler learned that not only did his factory become successful, it saved the lives of Jewish victims.",

Small gestures of kindness can overcome the inconvenient irks of everyday life, but absolute good must rise to the occasion to meet absolute evil, no matter the cost. In this story, there is no question about the absolute evil: the innocent victims of the Holocaust (the appeasement of which implicates us all, see The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich). In the backdrop of this absolute evil, our hero is not without guilt. He is a Nazi party member, an unabashed adulterer and war profiteer. But when history gives him the chance, he chooses to pursue an absolute good, the saving of a thousand innocent Jews from certain death. And this absolute good, pursued to the cost of his entire fortune, redeems him of all the other ills he had accumulated over his life.",

Soon enough he has all the money in the world and is happy as can be. Or so it appears, as the film progress you see the demeanor and attitude of Schindler change dramatically when he watches the Jewish people get slaughtered like animals by the Nazi's, after that he sets his heart on the sole task if getting them out of the camps and into his country. Schindler's List is the proved example of human kindness and compassion, It's a movie that will make your heart break and make the spirit soar at his heroic feet.

253,21 February 2005,EijnarAmadeus,10, Spielberg's Finest,"Steven Spielberg was a bravado kid before this, he'd spent his directing career showcasing his ""whizz-kid"" skills in such as 'Jaws', 'E.T.' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' - but in 1993 he suddenly turned another page. Spielberg crafted the Holocaust-drama of SCHINDLER'S LIST, a true WWII story about Oskar Schindler who saves 1100 Jews from certain death. And if anything, in the same year of 1993 Spielberg also released his other project, the dino-adventure 'Jurassic Park' which was a roller-coaster-ride, and felt more like the resonance of his 80s projects. SCHINDLER'S LIST on the other half, was a Spielberg the world hadn't seen, a director who took his task so seriously that he had kept postponing it since the early 80s - never feeling mature enough to handle its powerful story. In 1993 he felt and certainly was mature enough - this is a masterclass in film directing; shot in black&white there's a sense of no hope here, and it elegantly but affectingly changes between a disturbingly raw documentary-style to a German expressionism in which Spielberg uses every bit of his heaven-sent talent.",

It is impossible to talk about Schindler's List without mentioning his photograph that puts us straight into the 1940s, and this was a very good choice for Spielberg, we have some colorful scenes that are absurdly significant, like the scene of the girl in red who Symbolizes hope, and then ... With a soundtrack and convincing performances and an impeccable script, its 3 hours are not even tiresome, on the contrary, you want to see more, live longer, get more excited.

I am pleased that Spielberg told it and not, for example, Polanski or Scorcese. Spielberg (in some ways a Schindler himself, a guy with panache) relied on image, and feeling.

I've seen plenty of 'sad movies' and 'tearjerkers' over the years that I have left me emotion hollow. (Beaches and Terms of Endearment come to mind.) Schindler's List is different. It matters. The realism portrayed is frightening. You're not watching a film about the horrors of the Holocaust, you're witnessing the horrors of the Holocaust. Decent people, people just trying to make a living like you and me, put into such a devastating position for no fault of there own. And a man, a Nazi of all people, who has a virtue his peers seem to be lacking: compassion. But, unlike many weaker efforts to exploit human tragedy, the protagonist (Oskar Schindler)is initially set on cashing in on the force labor by the Jews he brings to his factory.

Steven Spielberg has found a wonderful story, and has told it with pain, passion, and wisdom that is rare in today's cinema.  In this three hour tale, Spielberg has at once shown us the horror of war, and has given us a story of courage and heroism to overcome it.  Strong performances by Liam Neelson as Oscar Schindler, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Feinnes enhanced the strength of this painful and touching story.

284,27 July 2009,johnmschofield,10, One of the greatest film epics,Last January a friend and I travelled to Kracow in Poland for a long weekend and while we were there we visited a town 50 kilometres from Kracow called Oswiecim or what the Nazis called Auschwitz. Had we visited that place 65 years ago I suspect what we would have seen then was graphically illustrated in this film. I do not know whether the film is historically accurate but the horror and degradation did take place and a man named Schindler tried to get a number of people out of that area before they became statistics too. The film in my opinion probably describes the times for those in NAZI occupied mainland Europe perfectly. In order to get anything that you wanted or needed you had to deal directly with people who had the power to have anybody killed on a whim not just because they could but also because they probably liked it. Oskar Schindler was an extremely good actor he must have been to have done what he did. Yes he paid a lot of money for these peoples lives but he had to go along with whatever happened no matter how bad to achieve what he did. The 1200 people he saved would probably not have survived but for his actions. This film may as well be a CCTV tape of those times and is therefore not fiction and anybody watching the film for the first time needs to keep that in mind.,

Is movie that should be watched at History class, because shows IN A PERFECT WAY how it was, and if it doesn't then better not know what really happen at that war! We just have to sit down and clap to this movie, that I would call THE BIGGEST MASTERPIECE ever done for a screen. Thanks Steven for giving the humanity the oportunity to have this movie!!!!",

True story: I was a teacher, now a substitute teacher. I was subbing for a high school genocide class which consisted of three periods a day. Unfortunately for myself I had to sit through the massacre of the ghetto three times in a row. You could hear a pin drop when it was time to end the period. After the third time of sitting through the same scene it was break time. I went into the restroom and vomited it was so upsetting. Of course this is nothing compared to the reality of the victims of genocide, but Spielberg spared nothing in his goal of realism. And to this day I can scarcely look at Ralph Fiennes without my skin crawling, he was such a good actor. Beautiful looking and talented man, his portrayal literally made me sick to my stomach.",

Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are great as Oskar Schindler and Itzhak Stern. Every one is great in there roles. Steven Spielberg's directing is absolutely fantastic. Much like the rest of the Film. The black and white really gives the movie a good old like feel. This movie is in fact very long, actually I think it's more than 3 hours, but it is still incredibly great. It might not be the best movie ever made but don't be fooled it is in the Top 10. The story is.......well I guess I can't say anything about the story because of the fact that it really happened. Well all in all this is a great movie. I highly recommend you see it.",

The visual images are thoughtful and provocative. One of the most powerful, intelligent, and triumphant stories I've seen on film in a very long time.

The actors and actress'complete this masterwork of a movie with absolute amazing performances. It follows the historical facts very careful and makes you believe that it happened almost as in the movie. A movie that makes you cry every time you see it, if not on the outside, at least on the inside. It touches your soul, even if you do not think it is the best movie in the world. Well the 6th place speaks for itself, this is without doubt one of the best movies ever! I like it so much because it captures the true effects of the war and the killing of all the million Jews. It shows how a single man helped hundreds to live through and keep fighting. Steven Spielberg uses all means to make it one of the greatest movies in the world.",

295,15 March 2004,rserrano,10, Transformed by the white light,"What makes this film truly remarkable is the personal transformation which Oskar Schindler under goes just past the mid-point of the movie in a series of incredibly subtle scenes. Early on, Schindler is driven only by selfish desire for money, women and influence. Others may benefit from his actions, but it is purely a by-product. Never does he help someone to his own detriment. He narrowly rescues Itzhak Stern from a train to a death camp and then scolds him, saying ""If I had been five minutes later, then where would I be?"". But by the end of the movie, Schindler willingly loses all his personal wealth and repeatedly risks his life in order to save others. The inflection point takes place at a meeting between Schindler and Stern at the Plaszow work camp. It's night and Oskar leaves a Nazi party to see his accountant. At the end of a brief conversation Stern says "" Don't let things fall apart. I worked too hard for this"". He is pleading with Schindler to take personal responsibility. As Stern walks away a search beacon shines over his shoulder and fills the screen with a blinding white light. The camera cuts to Oskar. He is engulfed by the light. He smiles of deep satisfaction. This sets off an amazing sequence of scenes: - Schindler comes to the aid of a metal presser. - He gives protection in his factory to a traumatised boy, despite the fact that he has no skills. He gives up his own silver lighter and cigarette case to make these two events happen. - He comforts Amon Goeth's abused maid. They sit beneath a cone of white light. At a point where he could easily take advantage of her, instead he helps her renew her will to survive. - In a discussion with Goeth after a party, he explains that true power comes not from control or the ability to kill, but the ability to forgive. This could be further interpreted as ""Success in life comes not from pursuing personal gain, but from rising above it"". Goeth is amused and intrigued by this but in the subsequent tragic ""bath tub stain"" scene, we see that he is pathetically incapable of internalizing anything that was said. - In perhaps the most powerful scene of the film, a women comes to Schindler and begs that he take her skilless, aged parents into his factory to save their lives. He appears from on high at the top of a long stair case. She tells him "" No one ever dies here. It is a haven. They say that you are good"". One can easily substitute the word ""heaven"" for ""haven"" and ""God"" for ""good"". In rage, Schindler throws her out. But then he goes to see Stern. He tells Stern that there is good in all people but that war brings out the worst in them. He uses this to rationalize and forgive the behavior of Goeth. We fully expect that he will now use this to rationalize his own selfish behavior. Instead he takes the watch from his own wrist and gives it to Stern to use to buy the lives of the two elderly parents. The irony is that war has borough out good in Schindler that might never have emerged otherwise. From here on out Schindler performs a continuous series of selfless acts. Moreover,despite the huge personal risks he takes, we feel good about the choices he makes and therefor we are transformed a little bit, along with him.",

It shows the story of one man who could change heart with the views of what happened during those years and why it happened. That will always be a question why. Steven Spielberg hits the movie rite on the spot and makes you feel as if your there. He brings it a ll back to life. Everyone gave off amazing performances. This is Spielberg's arguably greatest achievement other then Saving Private Ryan. At the end it makes you feel a little good inside to know what Oskar Schindler did for the Jews.

And felt as though Spielberg escaped the great and family films like E.T and Idiana Jones and was successful. Spielberg also does an uncommonly thing and keeps our attention for 185 mines. What I also liked was the rich black and white cinematography. The music helped move a lot of the scenes. I also liked the acting by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. I also feel that the film and the script are well constructed. I also liked the lighting when Schinder is at the party strobing across his eyes hiding the rest of his face. I liked the scene when all of Schindler's female workers were dropped of at the concentration camp, the scene when they were put in the showers, this scene was good but suspenseful with shot reverse shot from the screaming women to the shower heads as they thought that they had been put in the gas chamber. I felt that Spielberg kind of personified the gas chambers as though they were the real killers and the executioner and the Nazi's were just the jury. I also felt that another scene that was key was when Ralph Fiennes was going to kill that man behind the factory for not making enough door hinges and the gun jamming, as later on in the film Liam Neeson discusses with Ben Kingsley about the machinery have found to been faulty and he also made a point that he wants the weapons not to work, also with the scene later on we find out that the man is a Rabbi and so this could be that god was trying to save him, one of the officers said that it was impossible that all of the guns were jamming at the same time which made me think was the rabbi just plain lucky or was he being protected.",

I would say no. Spielberg made this movie like it was a gift for somebody to remember a bad thing that happened in history, and not a good one whatsoever. His fingerprint is put in many well-known movies, but in this one, he left something more than this. He imprinted in our brains a great lesson of history, maybe one the most remarkable and... shocking. He taught us the bloody human behavior of people and its abhorrence for others like them, who have other religion but are the same inside. It is the best black and white movie I have seen so far and I truly recommend it for those who want to learn a piece of unforgettable history.",

I believe the choice to keep the film in black and white was a great decision, as it means you are focused on the story-telling and acting rather than colours (also when on rare occasions colour does appear, it really makes those moments stand out at the time, and memorable later). The black and white almost removes the 'life' from the film, which I found to be important in the storytelling. The music by John Williams is absolutely stunning, and Itzhak Perlman's violin solo of the main theme is so moving (especially when considering the meaning behind this story and his partly Jewish roots). I am always pleased when filmmakers attempt important and moving topics that the films come out well, and Spielberg did an exceptional job on this film in all regards (from the casting, to the cinematography, to the music).

Despite this formulaic style, Neeson is very good playing Oskar Schindler, a decadent member of the Nazi party who nevertheless was a reluctant savior to some 1,100 Jews during WWII when he employed them in his factory, saving them from certain death in Hitler's concentration camps. Spielberg won a Best Director Oscar for the film, and he gets terrific supporting performances from Ben Kingsley, Embeth Davidtz, and most especially Ralph Fiennes as a despicable Nazi commandant.

And I have to say when I finally watched it, this was the only movie I knew immediately after that it was a pure masterpiece of film making. I knew this was a movie about the Holocaust, but I didn't know who Oscar Schindler was, so I had to do some research and saw he saved over a thousand Jews from Auschwitz. The movie started out a little slow, but It focused on different characters to build up depth and development. About an hour in I was so captivated by the realism and accuracy I couldn't look away even though it is very graphic and violent. The scenes in the prison camp were spot on, and each actor in this movie gave a flawless performance. Liam Neeson was perfect in the role as Schindler, and Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes were great as well.

After seeing this film highly rated on IMDb i eagerly anticipated the watching of it, i was not let down. This is without a doubt the greatest of Spielberg's achievements in film making. It is beautifully brought to the forefront of the screen with care, devotion and stunning acting to portray the harsh reality that was taking place in under Nazi rule in the 1940's. Liam Neeson's performance stands alone as one of the greatest solo performances on screen for a long time. Neeson portrays the amazing man of Oskar Schindler with such regard for the qualities needed he becomes infallible in his role. It would be unjust to say that powerful scenes are lacking and are seldom shown, i feel some scenes create such emotion you feel for the characters involved.To briefly state why i felt this film deserved 9 not 10 is that i felt it just missed something, nothing significant but just something that could of brought this film towards perfection. It really strikes you that the scenes being portrayed throughout the film were real- life events, in some cases worse. I feel Schindlers list moral is in a small way similar to The shawshank redemption, the true film masterpiece, which gives a message of hope. I feel in Schindlers list this message is true to that of many Jews but also of how a man can change, how one person can change and do the most remarkable things. To finish of this review to give all credit to this film, to tell no lies this was the first time and probably only time i saw a class completely and utterly captivated by a film, which i feel in itself is evidence that this film is truly stunning.",

Who would want to watch that? Here, although the cynical might scoff at the moments of Spielberg sentimentality (eg the girl in the red coat), and although it was a false step to have everyone put on Mittel-European accents, the director has managed to produce something in which, whilst it doesn't shirk the horror, the dominant and lasting impression is hope. It's a monument to the strength and compassion of humanity, Jewish and non-Jewish alike.

It gives us a very visual outlook of the inhumanity which was faced in the concentration camps. Taken like a documentary with black and white photography, Schindler's List is scary because it is real. There is also this chilling background music composition mixing Jewish hymns (very, very solemn) and another sad score by John Williams. I watched this in my history class in case you were wondering. So, should you watch this movie? I am not recommending it to high school students who've already read ""Night"" or learned in depth about the process of Hitler's ""Final Solution"" unless they find it interesting. In fact, I think ""Life is Beautiful"" is a more uplifting movie to watch in order to heal our sorrow after reading about Auschwitz and all those treacherous Jewish ghettos.

339,19 August 2014,GanzEhrlich,9, Moving,"I am probably still too young to understand the real reasons why SL is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. It was mostly shot in black and white while virtually all other movies in the decades before and since are in colour, adding even more of a sense of realism to the film. Schindler's List is a story of a man's change of heart and attitude alongside themes of survival, hope, brutality (mostly served by Ralph Fiennes' murderous Amon Goth)and countless other situations for hundreds of Jews. In black and white, the bloody, graphic summary executions of Jews throughout the film were overwhelming, the images freezing me in my seat and imprinting themselves in my mind to this day, but they justifiably implied to you the horrors of the Holocaust like no other movie. The girl in the red coat seems to symbolise, as her fate suggests, that there is no escape from the dominant force. The acting is spotless. Liam Neeson should have won an Oscar for portraying Schindler (I must admit, I am yet to see Tom Hanks in Philadelphia) with an emotional tone, the performance launching him into super-stardom once and for all. Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes also played their parts with the right touch, especially Fiennes whose character also seems to change within, halfway through the film, but only slightly, his insanity still alive as in one scene he randomly snipes numerous Jewish workers from his bedroom. But the star is director Steven Spielberg, who in 1993 made maybe not his most famous movie, other projects such as E.T., Saving Private Ryan, CEOTTK, the Indiana Jones saga also rising forward. But without question, maybe with the exception of Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List is Spielberg's finest work.",
340,23 October 2005,btodorov,10, a high praise of the spirit of capitalism,"I had avoided to see the movie for a decade. The Holocaust is so absolute an act of cruelty that it does not give good food for originality. I underestimated Herr Schindler, just as I naively underestimated Herr Spielberg. No other movie has so boldly approached a fundamental ethical controversy of this size. Was Herr Schindler a prudent man or a remorseless exploiter? Did he help or use his workers? Didn't he decide to save them only when realizing he would be hunted down by the Soviets? Schindler is depicted as the most human of humans - his conversation with Amon Goeth over the real meaning of power and control can easily be included in college syllabi. And yet being so human, he is neither good nor bad: there are forces beyond him - his greed and his love of life, that allow him neither to refrain from war-time profiteering nor to subscribe to the absurd legal degradation of the Jews into lesser beings (are they less kiss-able just because they carry the Yellow Star, would ask Schindler?).",
341,2 February 2008,tatmeister,9," Must-see War Drama. Informative, emotional and inspirational.","I watched Schindler's List a week ago in U.S history class, and at first I thought ""Oh great!. I'm watching a movie on the Holocaust in black and white. How can this actually make me learn any more about the Holocaust than I have in a textbook?"" My teacher put the tape on, and the first hour was a boredom fest, but as the characters such as Stern and Schindler develop their personalities, the movie becomes inspiring and hooked. I then removed the ""boredom fest"" aspect of my thinking, and transformed it into ""necessary story development/build-up"" At first we think Schindler is heartless, but having a personality and morales, he experiences the death of Jews firsthand. Of course, seeing such mindless mass executions will boggle anyone's mind. Schindler, who happens to be rich off of the Jews in WW2, helps them. The first hour of the movie is devoted to making the last 2 hours as commiserable for the audience as possible- making us feel connected to Schindler's emotions. ""What if we were in his shoes?"" not only that, the movie is an excellent depiction of the Holocaust. Black-and-white does the film justice, as it gives the movie a ""WW2 feel."" If it were in complete color, it's effects would not have been as strong. Watch this movie if at all possible. Emotions cannot be depicted by learning about the Holocaust in a classroom- you are simply being educated about the facts. Schindler's List reinforces this classroom learning by supplying empathy with the facts. After reading about WW2, this is one of the few movies that are a must-see. The acting, directing and editing is marvelous. Only problem I had was the length of the movie.",

We see here a movie that cannot be describes with simple words. What, I believe, gave this movie its soul is that fact that the director and his crew truly dedicated this remarkable feat to the victims of the darkest pages of history.   Frightening as the scenes were,  so was its message of final redemption.  Concentrating on the few who survived rather than the millions who perished was indeed a dangerous step that could have offended many.  And yet Steven pulled it off.  Through the survivors he honoured the dead.  Such complex feelings I had never felt at the movie theatres before. More words are useless.",

The first time, I thought it was grossly overrated and won its awards only because it was a Holocaust film. This was because my grandmother and cousin were talking the whole time. I saw it the second time because my friend wanted to see it and I figured if there were ever an opportunity to give it a second chance, then was as good as any. Good thing my friend is quiet. I watched the film without distraction and now admit my initial feelings for it openly and ashamedly, and I both regret and rejoice in my decision to watch it again. Schindler's List is a masterpiece, a brutally honest portrait of the darkest and most despicable chapter of human history that seizes the heart with a black hand and shatters it as each crack of gunfire cuts off the life of another innocent man, woman, or child. I cannot ever watch it again, unless I am showing it to someone who has never seen it. It is the tale of one man who saved hundreds from the undeserved wrath of the Nazis. Oskar Schindler was and forever will be a hero, and this testament to his courage captures every aspect of it, great and terrible.

Despite being a vital historic recount of the Holocaust, the movie itself as a drama is also beyond excellence. Seeing Amon's capricious animal-treating brutality, snowing ashes of burning corpses, and innocent children soaked in feces, it's impossible for any person of heart to not feel mournful, disgusted, or enraged. It will be difficult to find another fictional film that displays this tragic part of history as accurately as Schindler's List, while also bearing a complete and convincing main plot.

Schindler's List is a glowing testament to that fact and it is Spielberg's finest work to date. Do I ever think he'll surpass Schindler's List?

The interpretation of the main characters was of course astonishing. The murders and executions of the German Nazi were just as they had to be, not fake or incorrect.

It's unflinching in looking at the nature of good and the nature of evil.  The good is represented, at its most unlikely, in the form of Oskar Schindler, a womanizer, boozer, charmer, and money-grubber who nonetheless manages to do one good thing and save over a thousand lives.  Contrary to what some people have commented, he is not presented as a saint, but as a complex, enigmatic human being, and Liam Neeson plays him that way splendidly.  I do agree the scene where Schindler wishes he could have saved more feels misguided, but that's my only complaint about the film.",

However, for being a movie about one of the most tragic events in history, there was too much sex. Granted, there wasn't actually a lot, but the unnecessary female nudity of Schindler's sexual partners was a tad distracting. I was hoping to watch a GOOD movie without any need to show women's bodies in a sexual manner. Besides that, it is really amazing and I recommend it to anyone who loves a heartbreaking yet eye-opening movie. Please don't get angry with me for being an arrogant feminist who ""doesn't understand the moral"", because I certainly do. It just made me uncomfortable. Although not extremely gruesome, the violence is unforgettable and shocking at times. Still an excellent film.",

Basically dealing with the Jewish persecution by the Nazis during World War II in Poland, Schindler's list is a American epic historical period drama and biography of Oskar Schindler, who gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazis. Shot in black and white, with the odd carefully chosen touches in color, the horror of the holocaust is laid bare and speaks for itself. The documentary style allows Spielberg to deliver his message without preaching. The clever use of light and shade also makes it visually stunning.",
369,2 May 2004,tjc60,9, One of the best films of the 90's,"Initially presented as capitalistic and crude, Schindler's character gradually evolves into one of benevolence, and finally, humility. The film is shot entirely in black and white, with the exception of one character. A little girl wearing a pink jacket, which we see only twice in the film. It is that little girl, and the thought of what surely must happen to her, that sticks in one's mind. The two fleeting glimpses we get of this girl are more heart-wrenching than anything else in this film. This is not only an historical film;it has modern relevance as well. There are monsters among us, and poverty and ignorance are their life's blood. Overall,I give the film a 9. It's truly hard for a film to rate a 10 with me, which is the way it should be.",

It's a story about how one man saved hundreds of lives and countless generations. And about the 'poor old Jews'... More than 7 million jews were killed during the Hacaust. A period of less than a decade. Even if this many had died in a century, it's still unbelievable. So maybe, yeah, they deserve a movie showing what happenned. Also, I know it's unbelievable, but you'd be surprised at how many people don't actually know about the Halocaust and how much more you can learn from this movie than by staring at digits in a text book.

The acting here is great. Everyone does their best. Liam Neeson is amazing here. Every emotion that he feels can be seen in his eyes and when he sees a random pedestrian getting murdered, you'd perfectly see that he feels sympathy for he victim and anger towards the Nazis. The near end scene here shows a burst of emotion from him. That scene is just spot on perfect in every way. You could see all the pain he kept in him and he opened up to a crowd of Jews. There are a lot of frightening scenes here especially the burning bodies scene. It just shows how many people the Nazis have killed and they still manage to be angry at the Jews.

But, some things are still here in our mind and life as a brutal portrait about what humans can do with ourself. One of these happenings are the World war I-II. The terror and brutality was never so perfect and planed. The story of the Jew's and other innocent nations between 1939-45 is never to forget. Steven Spielberg one of the best directors our time made an unforgettable masterpiece with Schindler's List in 1993. The story of Oscar Schindler the businessman who saved more than 1000 Jewish life at the end of the German terror is more than a movie. It's a documentary of years full with pain, fear and death. We can clearly see what happened in Europe and most in Poland until WWII. Spielberg's directing art in his most touching movie is phenomenal. The cinematography with the beautiful heart touching music of John Williams and the powerful acting with names like Ralph Fiennes, Liam Neeson and of course Ben Kingsley made an excellent work. Everyone should see this to never forget and maybe understand what can happen when mankind goes crazy.And if you can go to Poland, You should visit Krakow and the place where the Jewish ghetto was in Kazimierz.

Truly, have you ever seen a bad movie (or series, or even a document for that matter) made about the subject? I haven't.

Filmmaker just couldn't fail with real-life drama of this magnitude in his hands. Neither could Mr. Spielberg.",

In my defense though, the film came out when I was one year old. I was too young to understand the subject matter much less to bring into a movie theater. Well, I have atoned for my sins and finally watched the movie. I turned it on expecting it to be a film that I know I should admire but for some reason am not grabbed by. On top of that, I have usually associated Steven Spielberg with Jurassic Park, E.T., and Hook before I can even allow myself to recall that he directed Saving Private Ryan much less other films on its same level of dramatic intensity. Point being, I was not expecting Schindler's List to move me.

The Jewish holocaust has been portrayed in many of these films, but few can say that they have accomplished it with Steven Spielberg's mastery of 'Schindler's List'.
The film tells us how an entrepreneur, Oskar Schindler, decides to hire Jews in his factory in order to save them from the holocaust. This story works perfectly to show the horror in the most direct way possible. Spielberg uses all the cinematographic resources to show this fact in an extremely direct way, with an almost documentary tone. All the elements in the film are arranged to represent this dark stage, above telling a story, despite the fact that this is a fundamental part of the entire context in which it unfolds.
It is a fact that 'Schindler's List' is not only one of the best movies about WWII, it is one of the best movies in film history. Spielberg delivered a realistic and crude piece that should never be forgotten, as a reminder of vivid actions that should not happen again.",

415,7 July 1999,DButcher,10, Transcendental Film-making,"Back in December 1993, I drove into Kansas City to view Schindler's List at a midnight showing. The film, which dealt with something as simple as human compassion in a time when compassion was far from simple was truly one of the most magnificent pieces of film-making I had ever seen. But as truly moving as the film was, my distinct memories come after the film, at 4 AM on a Wednesday, driving home through the Plaza Area of KC. Anyone who has ever been to Kansas City knows the beauty of the Plaza Lights. With nobody else on the road, with the frost glazing the streets, the stillness of the moment still haunts me. I know that if it were any other Wednesday morning, I perhaps would not have appreciated that beauty quite so much as that particular Wednesday. The real power of Schindler's List and its simple story of a man who did the right thing at a time when there was madness all around him is not just one of the most important films historically, not just one of the great films artistically, not just one of the most powerful films emotionally, but it stands as an achievement that transforms the very way you see the world. I know that watching this film on video, picked-up at the video store on some rather ordinary Wednesday cannot really convey as much power as it did to me on that winter night 5 years ago. Watching it on video is still more moving than many other films that could never even imagine itself to aim so high.

416,29 May 2006,Nerdboy1423,1, Representation misused,"This is just another film like Amistad that Steven Spielberg thought might be important to put to film. But, after seeing a film like United 93, I feel that, going back to this film, I see it as exploitation. That it is exploiting the pain of the entire holocaust and the tragedy that it really was, and exploiting that for emotional reasons but worse, to give Oskar Shindler an opposite, and something to purify him from a narrative character perspective. It's not that I hate the film, it's well made in every aspect, but it is basically a Frank Capra picture set within a really huge tragedy. One character is not the hero or villain here, there is no black and white. Since it chooses to display the Holocaust so graphically, do it in a better way. But watching the film and contrasting it to what actually did happen, I have to wonder, is there a really truthful way of representing the Holocaust? It's such a monstrous tragedy, the big abomination of the 20th century, should it really be put onto film, and are the words now used to describe it, ""Never Again"", really a truthful representation? Is this how we want people to remember the Holocaust? Through a film that presents a hero struggling to be a capitalist and struggling to be a good man by Western standards by saving as many people as possible. If he had saved ""one more"" person, it wouldn't have mattered. The film is permanent, and the Holocaust itself is as well. I firmly believe this is not the appropriate way to depict something that actually happened and was so important. It's the singular voice of the director here, this film might as well by ""It's A Wonderful Life"", because that is essentially what it is. The same story, the same character arc for Shindler. It's just not appropriate and I think that the time has not come yet for us to truly be able to grasp the atrocity of the Holocaust.

This man Schindler, this vain, greedy, con man, his transformation from a nobody trying to scheme the system, into one of the great heroes of modern times, is the magic trick that delivers the movie. How did it happen, how did this man of all people, throw a fortune away, and risk life and limb in the very heart of evil, that is the question. So many did nothing, so many did evil in the name of duty, so few heroes, but there were heroes, heroes of the type that saved humanity by showing even under the worst possible circumstances, mankind has the capacity to rise to the occasion. Evil is in abundance, and Schindler is outnumbered, but many heroes emerged in the holocaust, not just Schindler, many hid Jews, many spirited Jews to safety but few were as outnumbered and at the very heart of the holocaust as Schindler. How do you protect, and keep 1,100 people from being murdered, and do it all out in the open, only the best conman could have done it, its almost as if Schindler trained his whole life, all his cons, all his act and charisma finely tuned, just so he could pull off the greatest scheme of them all, tricking the Nazi's out of 1,100 Jewish souls.",

The difference between these two stories is that the last one is true. Now many people will ask why that man by the name of Oskar Schindler did that. I think I know the answer. There's another scene in this great movie in which you can see Schindler and one of his many lovers by his side riding horses. They are witnessing the liquidation of the ghetto from the top of a hill nearby and staring at the scenes in disbelief and horror. Many Jews are killed in front of their eyes (of course the murderers are not aware of them) but Schindler isn't looking away. He isn't turning his back to the victims until the woman by his side is telling him to leave. Sometimes the last century is called the century of genocide. These genocide were possible because millions and millions of people were looking to the other side, while their neighbors were carried away, beaten to death, shot. I'm not sure if I would do the same but if you watch this film what you really should do you will see that one man can truly make a difference if he's not looking away.",

426,16 February 2006,sadrec1,10," A brilliant, sobering film","Schindler's List is a profound film that gives an eye opening look at one of the darkest, most despicable periods of the 20th century, the Halocaust. It unflinchingly tells the story of 1,100 Jews, who, when millions upon millions of their brethren were systematically murdered by the Nazis, survived, due to the actions of a greedy businessman. Steven Spielberg definitively proved his talents to the world when he made this film. No longer was he merely a sap-seller who made visually stunning summer films about alien landings, swashbuckling archaeologists, and sadistic Semi Trucks. He proved he could direct a harrowing, serious film which from every corner oozes artistry. I can't tell how much I love the fact that the film is in black and white. The medium works perfectly in presenting this grim time many of us only know of in shocking old photographs. More brilliant still are the sporadic uses of color. Much has been said about the moment when Oscar Schindler watches a young girl in a red dress walk quietly through the horror of the Krakow Liquidation, but not as much has been noted about my favorite instance of color. In the first scene, a Jewish family is gathered around a table to observe the Sabbath. The Father reads a prayer, and the camera slowly moves in on the candles on the table as the family fades out of the scene and color slowly dissipates. Soon, only the orange flame of the candles are in color, and they are soon extinguished. This, to me, represents the hope that was snuffed out by the Nazis during the Halocaust. Later in the film, Oscar Schindler, at his new artillery factory, allows some of the Jews to observe the Sabbath. They too gather around a candlelit table to read a prayer, and the flames of the candle glow orange; now that these Jews are safe, this is hope for them again. The performances are fantastic. I both applauded and scolded Liam Neeson as the alternatively brave and selfish Oscar Schindler, seethed with anger at Ralph Fiennes as the detestable SS Officer Amon Goeth, and felt immense pity for Ben Kingsley as the sorrowfully noble Itzhak Stern. Of course one of my favorite things about the film is the music. Not the traditional plagerized pomposity of John Williams earlier scores, the music for this film is carried by a gentle, sorrowful melody, often played by master violionist Ithzak Perlman. This is a film I believe all should see. Schindler's List will, hopefully, open your eyes to the immense evil that man carried out against his fellow man during the Halocaust.",

I am a major defender of the nation of Israel and a lover of her people.

The thing is that it takes brilliant directing, Spielberg, and performance to be able to reflect this true experience through a movie so smoothly.  The attention to details has contributed to this very successful portrayal of the great pain, degradation and global disaster that took place 50 years ago.  Details such as the nudity scenes of this large number of people that conveys the concept of lack of individuality to a degree implying disrespect and humiliation that is scary.  The components of the characters of Oskar and Stern are very well presented because they are real characters with components of good and bad.

438,30 August 2013,larseirikf,10, A horrifically realistic depiction of the Holocaust,"Few movies really stay with me for years and years, but this one does. I think it will leave an impact on anybody, for that matter. Both the cruelty of the Nazis as well as the grotesque Holocaust are very realistic in this movie, and a lot of the scenes are directly painful to watch. A lot of the movie makes the viewer see the Holocaust through the eyes of Schindler, and how he understands more and more that this is wrong. And they have made a very good job in making the viewer feel like they ARE Schindler, watching all this. Especially is a little girl in red walking alone in a ghetto, who we later see dead in a pile of corpses. This is a moment you will remember for the rest of your life. In a lot of other movies, you can comfort yourself with that the violence is only fiction, but in Schindler's List you are forced to face the brutal fact that this actually happened. So why even watch this? Because with what Schindler ends up doing makes you feel that there might be a little hope for the Jews in the camps, a little chance of turning the hopeless situation. And so you end up (spoilers ahoy) all the more relieved when he gets a group of them out. the scene with his realization of everything he could have done to save a couple of more Jews from death was strong enough for me to blink back tears. So prepare for a powerful experience rather than a mere movie, because you are in for precisely that.",
439,12 April 2005,liam-tully,9, Utterly beautiful and breathtakingly made.,"|This film is almost perfect,both in its place as a cinematic masterpiece visually,and in its sensitively handled subject matter.It is only given a nine by myself because i really don't think i will ever see a film that truly deserves a ten.The film is about a subject that affected millions,The Holocaust,but it has a very personal impact on the viewer by concentrating on a group of people that are characterised enough that the viewer relates with them so much more.If they had tried to show the wider spread effects of the Holocaust,the empathy would be diminished,because although based on harrowing events it would become just another historically based movie,with too much going on.What makes Schlindlers list so touching is that your given time to relate to the central characters in such a way that you feel you could almost imagine what they are feeling,and any film that can take you to that level of empathy is automatically a classic in my book! It is a good way to ''teach lessons''as it were because it affects anybody who watches it.Anyone harbouring fascist views should be made to sit and watch this movie repeatedly.If they can still be that way after seeing this,they must be in human,it really is that good at getting to anyone on an emotional level.This impact is heightened by the beautifully used black and white tones of the film,with significant items/parts in vibrant colours,stunning!The score is very effective too.Any one who can watch the ending without feeling moved is a robot!Fact!The film is great,granted but the cast also take this film to new heights,Liam Nesson is superb in his portrayal of a man forced to question his own values,beliefs and place in a system that is wrong,and who chooses the right path,absolutely mesmerising!

445,7 June 1999,silly-7,10, Excellent movie,"Schindler's List is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's finest films, and there countless reasons why.  Spielberg is able to portray Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson) as a womanizer, shrewd businessman, and profiteer of the war in a way that does justice to the character's complexity.  Through the use of black and white he brings you back to the time of the Holocaust, while using color in the present to bridge the gap between past and present.  In particular, the use of black and white to identify the Holocaust is appropriate given the brutal nature of the event.  People dream in color, but they have nightmares in black and white.  The scenes themselves help show the facelessness of the Holocaust and the horror it brought to its victims.  In particular, there is one scene in which a number of Jews are forced into a shower expecting to be gassed.  The looks on their faces, along with the moving music, makes this scene one of tremendous fright. Although in this scene the Jews are not gassed, the message of this scene is there- even when Jews were not being killed, they were subject to horrors beyond the imagination of the human mind- everyone was a victim, including those who were not killed.  All in all, Spielberg uses the medium to his advantage and recreates in vivid detail much of the Holocaust, while also telling a story of how one overcomes his ignorance to help others in the end.",

With so many bad movies, with no substance at all, it's wonderful to know that those kind of movies like ""Schindler's List"" prove to us that masterpieces are still possible. Congrats, Steven Spielberg!!! The movie presents an apparently vain character who wants to gain profit with his business, by employing only Hebrew people, because they are paid less( they aren't paid at all, only the taxes for them are paid). Through the movie we are given the chance to see some great and very very moving frames of the Holocaust...women and old people are being killed in front of our eyes, humiliation and cruelty is being presented as if it would happen right now...it is a lesson to learn and it is history relieved in a traumatic way. The movie is tragic, but the fact that Schindler acts in such a humanitarian way is reassuring for us to know that...after so many crimes and so much evil, there still is GOOD in us. This movie is a MUST if you wanna watch an unforgettable movie!",
452,4 January 2011,johnno74,10, Do not miss this.,"Schindler's List is based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally and on a true story about a German factory worker, Oskar Schindler, who is a member of the Nazi party and due to his decreasing number of employees, employs the Jewish residents in his factory. Schindler's List explores the true dark side of the Second World War. Unlike most World War Two based movies, Schindler's List is based on the Holocaust; the cruelty of the Jews during the period. The film is also a history lesson; it explores all the years of the war; starting from 1939, the start of the war, to the very end, although the main focus is Oskar Schindler whose actor is Liam Neeson (Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, A-Team movie). The character, not only is represented as a womanizer and laid-back, but he is obviously the odd one out; he does not see the Jews as bad people unlike the other Nazis and because it is his job to employ factory workers, cannot resist temptation in saving the Jews from the camps, where the Jews are imprisoned. This shows the message that working on the evil side is the only way to rescue innocent people, which is what would have occurred during a brutal era like World War Two. This is why the film deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Picture. John Williams' incredible score links very well with the German Jewish culture, but also represents sadness and bleakness in the story, because it tempts the viewers to feel sympathy for the Jews. The black and white tone also suggests the darkness of the story, but also links with the 1940s setting when most films used the colour tone. Even if it looks older than other nineties movies, Schindler's List was definitely a modern film; for one reason, the film combines black and white with colour; the first shot consisting of a group of Jews paying respects to Oskar Schindler is filmed using colour and the viewer will easily spot a tiny amount of colour during one of the crowd scenes. Another reason is due to the following actors in the film; Ben Kingsley (Gandhi, Thunderbirds movie) who plays Ishaak Stern, Ralph Fiennes (Wallace & Gromit In The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit) as Amon Goth and Caroline Goodall (Hook) the actress of Emilie Schindler. Schindler's List was directed by Steven Spielberg who won an Oscar for Best Director and is considered one of his best works ever. It proves that Steven does not just direct thrilling adventure movies!",

A brilliant camera work along with the print used in the accompanied with the most adequate lighting adds to the horror of the situation. The jarring camera work immediately transports us to that era of which we have only black and white memory. As far as the script is considered I think it will be much more than ten textbooks any one will read in script writing. Acting if Liam, Ralph and Ben have been most natural you will find in any kind of Cinema. It seems they never supposed that they were recorded on Camera. And finally coming to direction it is Most Brilliant. I just wish to be present at the point when Spielberg would have been explaining his scenes to his actors and the perfect coordination with the people at back ground and foreground. Some scenes such as small children's not more than the age of fine throwing stones at the Jew when they were moved to camps, the horror which women witness when they were moved to another camp and they apply there on blood on there cheeks to look radiant and young were beyond imagination and end I think is beyond what has ever been ever filmed.

I must also admit however that I have a great deal of respect for his charming and subsequent brainwashing of Hollywood, and how easily he has made himself a brand name that always commands respect despite having made some of Hollywood's most overrated and tired films. With Schindler's List he truly created some powerful images, thought provoking and inciting in how they make you react...BUT... That's about where it ends. The talent of Steven lies in his ability to pull the strings of an audience, and in placing his propaganda so effectively, yet in this film with such a weak cast (other than Ralph Fiennes who was very effective as opposed to the generally weak and painful to watch Liam Neeson) and tired subject he breaks no new ground. Not to say it did not have its beautiful scenes, the executions and murders were poignant and well done, but lost much of their effect being coupled with so much overdone melodrama and sap. Its about time Hollywood wakes up, we need new directors who are bold yet sensible enough to know that there is no such thing as too far, but are intelligent enough to make a film that can rely on something other than pure shock, and that sometimes just a little is not enough and this is perfect evidence of that point. This film would have been excellent had a master such as Stanley Kubrick made it, but as it stands Schindlers List garners a 2 out of 10 in my eyes and is one of Spielberg's better films, but if nothing else its far superior to ET and the wretched Saving Private Ryan.",

476,11 December 2015,kmcanerney_2016,10, What can be said,"Kubrick said that the holocaust was about six million who died, Schindler's List was about six thousand who didn't. That perfectly encapsulates the brilliance of this film. The Holocaust was the most horrific event man ever caused, nothing comes close. Somehow, Spielberg found a story of hope in the pitch black evil. That is not to say this movie is for the faint of heart. Nothing about Schindler's List is easy, it will break you but in the end the tears you shed--and you will cry--are not elicited by horror but by beauty. It is the story of a man, by no means a saint, who finds it in himself to stand up against the horrors of his day. I could write on about the acting, writing or directing, and it is all superb, but to do so would miss the point. Schindler's List excels because it has the all important fourth factor, the right stuff. I am too young to have seen it in theaters and I envy those who shared this experiences with strangers, but every time I watch this film I am left speechless. I do feel the need to right about the ending. Realizing that the evil presented in this film is of a degree we cannot fathom, Spielberg brilliantly reconnected us to reality. It was on my third viewing when it occurred to me that the little boy, the grandson of a Schindler Jew, was no more then eight years old. This would mean that he was born after Schindler died yet owes his entire existence to the man. This is the beautiful part of the story, this is what brings me to tears every damn time. Schindler's influence stretches beyond the grave. This movie was over twenty years ago, that boy is now a man, probably married, maybe with children. Schindler gave the girl a husband, the boy a father, and they never shared time on earth. This is one of the twentieth centuries most extraordinary films about one of its most extraordinary men and if it wasn't for the film, we wouldn't even know the name Oskar Schindler.",
477,14 January 2013,TheFilmFanatic1,10, The best film I have ever seen,"I have to admit, I'm a bit of a history geek. I love Historical movies and Schindler's list is not only the best historical movie I've ever seen, but one of the best movies I've ever seen. This is the best Liam Neeson movie and he, paired with the tremendous Ralph Fiennes as Oskar Schindler and Amon Goeth respectively, lead the line in what is a superb cast. Ben Kingsley is superb in his supporting role as Itzhak Stern. However, at the helm of this movie, is the almost immortal Steven Spielberg who utilises his directorial skills to create an atmosphere that makes you feel as if you're right there at that moment. The movie is jam-packed with symbolism, particularly the use of the girl in the red coat. For me, there is no other war movie that portrays the struggle of the Jews as effectively as this one. One thing separates this from every other war movie, the decision to film it in black and white. This Black and White tone creates an automatically dull tone for the movie, but it also helps to create an historical tone, almost as if you are actually in the 1940's. To conclude, everything about this movie is perfect, the actors, directors and overall tone of the movie. It is a film that will, and I repeat just to emphasise, will stand the test of time. People will look at this movie in years to come, and they shall know not only the brilliance of the movie, but how Oskar Schindler helped to save all of those people during the war.",

Now with all due respect to actor Tom Hanks who'd won for his role in ""Philadelphia"" I've always felt that the best actor honor should've gone to Liam Neeson. I don't recall the other nominated actors that year though his portrayal of Oskar Schindler was outstanding and very convincing. And besides the following year at the Oscar ceremony Tom Hanks won the top acting honors for ""Forrest Gump."" Furthermore I've always found that this movie at the time was really over-hyped back in 1994. And today I still consider this movie to be quite overrated! There are many fans of Tom Hanks who'll disagree and that's understandable. I'll even add that Liam Neeson was robbed of the best actor award.

No movie has ever moved me the way it did, and I don't think ever will. It manages to be both beautiful, horrifying, hopeful, and depressing all at the same time which is incredibly hard to do. With this film, Spielberg really shows what masterful director he is. Liam Neeson also gives a jaw dropping performance as Oskar Schindler. I can say without a doubt that this is one of the greatest acting performances I've ever seen. Every single line, ever single emotion, Liam Neeson acts it out perfectly. The next great performance is what I consider to be the greatest performance of all time: Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth. Ralph Fiennes' plays this character so good, that Amon Goeth is arguably the most unlikeable, despicable character to ever appear on screen. (Amon Goeth being a real person makes his performance even more stomach wrenching). This is a once in a generation performance. Ben Kingsley also has an incredible performance in this, playing Itzhak Stern. In my opinion, Schindler's List is the most powerful, emotional and important movie ever made.

They normally didn't allow me to watch R rated movies (they didn't even let me see PG-13 rated movies until I was 13). I of course was familiar with the holocaust from school, but this film really shows just how horrible the atrocities were that went on here. Mr. Schindler was a great man for what he did, and this film does an excellent job of honoring his memory. Schindler's list is about a man named Oskar Schindler who owned a factory in Germany during World War II. After seeing how Jews are treated in the concentration camps he feels deep sympathy for them and wants to do something, anything to help. So he gets the idea to convince the Germans that he needs more help in his factory to help with the war effort and that Jews would make excellent workers.

484,3 October 2020,SeyedYasinHosseini,10, The List is Life,"Schindler's List a film by Steven Spielberg, with a great cast, excellent storyline, conceptual quotes(I really enjoyed dialogues) and lovely music is the best ever movie, not only about holocaust but also about humanity and about war in general. The genre is biography that I like that because I believe they are important. The movie, based on a novel by Thomas Keneally, shows how Oscar Schindler, a member of Nazi party, saved the life of thousands of Jews during the World War II. This film was shot is black and white, it is because of some reasons such as black and white (duality) stands for sorrow - influencing the feelings of the viewer in addition by using this method, spectator can feel this is about history, sorrowful history of course.
Despite its long time, the movie is not even a little bit tedious. I wonder how the movie impressed me, in other words how the movie stunned me is adorable. While watching the movie, I was not in my room but I was completely in another world.
You can find lessons of life, generosity, self-sacrifice and many other things in this film. ""Oskar Schindler: One more person. A person, Stern.""(Oskar regret why he cannot survive more people) My mind was engaged with the word ""A person"", do not look the number, here I realized the worth of humanity. ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."" on the other side savagery and cruelty are shown as well.
In most cases, films based on novels cannot be as well as the novels so as soon as I finished the film, I purchased the book. Do not miss it.
Overall thanks to the cast. The cinema must proud to itself because of such movies.",
485,11 November 2004,tom-hammond,9, What can be said that has already been said,"This film just speaks of one thing importance ,the importance of remembering what happened and the importance of realizing that there is evil that we as ordinary people cannot really comprehend . Not only is this film done stylishly but it is made in such a way that you are captivated by everything that happens there are powerful performance all round from Liam Neesons portrayal of a warm ,charismatic and gregariuos human being to the other side of the mirror Ralph Fiennes Amon Goeth who is bereft of a soul a brilliant portrayal of a man who is cold and is not a human being and does not have any real identifiable human charteristics apart from evil and that is what I think the movie is about not only the terror and horror of a human tragedy and disaster but showing how people can be and the two sides of human nature",

487,8 September 2014,thomas2193,9, Spielberg's masterpiece,"Schindler's list is a film that showcases the true horrors that occurred during the second world war, and manages to captivate them in the most realistic way that's possible. Although the film was produced in 1993, most of the film has been shown in black and white, which adds to the time period. This is a true masterpiece released by Steven Spielberg, and you can feel the emotion and fright from the actors involved. It must be horrifying beyond any recognition to live in such mortal danger as people did back in the second world war, but Spielberg exactly knows how to portray the story on the big screen, in a perfect manner. The film lasts longer than three hours and even looks like a live filmed documentary instead of a film, but it's truly magnificent and the story, especially the second half of the film, will really suck you into it so you never get the feeling it lasts too long.",

A truly great film, most will agree. Much better than the Piano in my mind. I'm sure the B & W hurt the box office, but Spielberg isn't concerned with that, was he?! For me, the B & W made it less intense (I'm nearly sure, that wasn't the main M.O.; probably done because Steven ""saw"" the past in B & W) & I was glad. I do wish to single out Liam Neeson & Ralph Fiennes for electrifying performances. ",

Steven Spielberg's directing contributes a lot to that, and he certainly deserved the Oscar. When the story is about 1100 jews being saved from the terror of German nazism, compared to the number of 6 million jews being killed in the Second World War, it doesn't really sound like something gripping and touching. But by showing the destiny of a small number of people, we somehow get the whole picture anyway...Liam Neeson is great throughout the movie... Like I said, a true masterpiece...",

In that regard ""Schindler's List"" is a daring movie but the end result is more powerful than you could have ever imagined.

496,14 June 2020,Bob_647,9, Dramatically characterised depiction of the Holocaut that filled by sorrow as ever.,"Schindler's List is based on a 1983 novel, Schindler's Ark. It tells the story of the efforts of Oscar Schindler, a German, to help Jews during the Holocaust. Played by Liam Neeson, Oscar is not an easy character to comprehend. It takes you time to fully understand who he is. He is a person who might come across selfish to you at first. He is an opportunistic businessman. He comes across as one who, even during the wartime, is trying to find opportunities to make money rather than worrying about people's lives. But deep inside, he has a heart bigger than the most and at a time when Jews were struggling to find a helping hand, he helped more than a thousand Jews. He is not a person who will give you sympathy for you are going to lose someone close, but he is one who would take actions to save your closed one and not tell you when he does. You can see this in the movie when a Jewish lady approaches him begging to get her parents out of the concentration camp and into his factory. At first, he not only denies her help but also lashes out at his assistant showing frustration how his for-profit factory has come to be known to people outside as a charitable harbor for Jews. But you can hear the pain he feels for that lady and all the other Jews in his frustrated voice. Later in the scene, the lady's parents are shown being escorted out of the concentration camp into his factory.",

From the beginning it is such a powerful and moving film and it brought tears to my eyes more then once. It is completely set in Black & White, except for the Red Coat Girl which is pure genius, since it really helps develop the time period it was portrayed in.",
498,5 February 2009,dan80074,10, In the top 10 of all time,This movie is Spielberg's best movie and that says a lot. His direction is flawless (although he was averse to direct it) as is the movie. The choice for black and white was great. Those who say its fictional and that isn't how it was and I have no idea what they are talking about. Nazis hated and killed Jews during WWII. Thats exactly what the movie shows and in the middle of it all was a man named Oscar Schindler who really did fool the Nazis by bribing them. His spent millions and saved thousands and it really happened. And Schindler knew a man named Amon Goeth who was a psycho Nazi. The men who played these guys played them as close to perfection as possible. Liam Neeson was fabulous as the man who first cared for nothing but money and his heart was changed after the horror he witnessed (but respectively lost to Tom Hanks for Philadelphia). Ralph Fiennes was great as the crazy Nazi and truly made the performance believable. This movie is probably the greatest movie of the 90s and should have reminded most people at the time that not all modern movies are sub par. The three hour and change epic goes up there with the greats.,
499,13 July 2007,SuperBadgerr,10, Amazing Portrayal,"I saw this movie last night, I was so moved by the whole movie, although the first hour is talking, once you see what happens to the Jewish when they are done talking you begin to be afraid for them yourselves.",

I loved how the movie was in black and white and it really fit in with the story and how dull times were during the holocaust. If it had not been in black and white the movie wouldn't have been as good. The picture in this movie was so beautiful and the directing by Steven Spielberg was very good also. Im glad that this movie won a lot of Oscars. The acting by Liam Neeson and Ralph Phiennes was amazing but I can understand why Tom Hanks won that Oscar for Philadelphia.,
501,24 December 2001,phoeniusphreak,10, Perfection,"Few Films on this planet can meet the feeling you get from watching this film. An amazing amount of emotions run through your veins and its through this emotions we are manipulated into seeing through the eyes of Steven Spielberg's amazing vision. After seeing this film for first time I cannot tell you the amount respect I felt for Jews and my fellow person. This film makes you realise who you are and what we need to become to put our petty differences aside. Liam Neeson is magnificent, his portrayal of his character is perfect and he shows a softness and a love for people throughout the film and Liam Neeson portrays this perfectly, his character is a womaniser yet he is very aware of his faults and to the viewer its remarkable how much you can understand from him. Through the actors Steven Spielberg brings this epic to life. Ralph Fiennes one of Britain's amazing exports shows how a character can be consumed with hate and be able to survive with the things he has done. The acting in this film is creative and very very believable. Ralph represents the element of fear. As his character develops and matures we see that his character can change yet he doesn't want to. here is a amazing amount of subliminal messages which are put in this film and the viewer can identify with this everytime. Ben Kingsley is absolutely perfectly cast as he plays his role with an amazing amount of power and strength eventhough his role is supposed a very fragile person. he portrays this person perfectly, but allows the viewer to see the hope and the hate in others. This is how Spielberg not only has made the perfect film but he manipulates our fears and our truths and shows we can change, he does this in amazing fashion. 3 hours plus this film is short and its short because you cannot feel it, if you are prepared to give this film the chance it deserves. Its beautifully set and the black and white colour of the film portrays a meaning that only a viewer can interpret, Ill leave that to you.",

It is a very sensitive topic, and making a movie about how millions of people were exterminated in death camps seems like trivialising the topic. On the other hand criticizing the movie for it's factual faults is even more slippery nontheless. The movie itself is very good indeed, with great acting, memorable scenes, and overall very impressive. I remember that when the end credits started rolling people in the theater were very quiet, and didn't move. Many were shocked by the realism of this movie.

And that responsibility entails NOT using his cheesy, shallow sensibilities to turn one of the most profoundly horrible parts of human history into a soap opera-style piece of fluff. This film is more than just a bad film, it is a downright dangerously bad film that will be watched by millions of impressionable people who might have had few other sources to base their knowledge of the Holocaust on. Most of us agree that the worst thing to do about something like the Holocaust is to forget it, lest it happen again.

Spielberg is able to show the suffering of the Jewish people in a detailed and humanised way that makes their stories tangible. This movie took great efforts to show that each life is precious, and the sheer number of those murdered should not lead to ignoring that each person had a unique story. What is unfortunate for a movie that attempted to elucidate the amount of human suffering clear from any politics, is that a blatant political statement was made at the end. the line by the Russian officer, 'Don't go east, that's for sure. They hate you there. I wouldn't go west either, if I were you' when the Jews are freed is a clear attempt at a justification for a Jewish state. the entrance of politics could overshadow the othewise far-reaching message of the film, which is a human one. other then that, the movie was impressive at arousing a feeling of human sympathy and compassion.",

As i sat down to watch this, l was told that this is one of the most powerful cinematic masterpieces of all time, it was hard to see it before the viewing, but after the viewing of this film, l have no doubt that this is one of the greatest films of all time. It captures the horrors of humanity and the best in humanity. All this in 1 film is almost impossible, but the genius Spielberg has done it somehow. This is his finest work, yes ET, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, all fantastic films, but Schindler's List is his finest work. The actors in this film are incredible. Liam Neeson in probably the performance of his well established career is the Protagonist Oskar Schindler. The Antagonist Amon Goeth portrayed by Ralph Fiennes is one of his best performances of his career is chilling as a brutal Nazi Guard. The story of Oskar Schindler had to be told and it was due to the incredible film making skills of Steven Spielberg, the best film maker of our generation if not of all time. All in all, this must go down as one of the greatest films of all time. I certainly enjoyed this movie. WARNING: Extremely graphic scenes, coarse language and violence.

The black and white representation provokes the feeling of desolation, and shows the seriousness of the events that took place during that era, but doesn't overshadow the brilliance of Schindler's unrelenting kindness and heroism despite all obstacles. It gives descriptive recounts of how heinously and inhumane Jews were treated, with raw and unforgiving scenes unlike those seen in most factual films.

This movie shows with a lot of respect for the victims, but without any blinders the real horror and the madness of the Third Reich. It really teaches one about the insanity possible in a person. But next to the shown insanity one can also learn so much about the power of one single person trying to move something.

Spielberg directed this movie superbly, and the work done by Janusz Kaminsky (director of photography) was magnificent. I must admit that I don't always pay attention to these details, but what was done in Schindler's List, captures your attention and is hard to ignore any detail. The performances are also pretty amazing, Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler is perfectly interpreted. Every expression builds a man, who starts as an ambitious business owner, and eventually, turns into a compassionate man.

The scene with the women thinking they were in the gas chambers did happen. I will get the book out again so I can tell you more. It was a great read and you get to see the people such as Amon Goeth's maid, he in fact had two Jewish Maids both called Helena. Amon called one Helen and the other Lena.

I was in college when this movie came out. It is an extremely difficult movie to watch. Even at my young age, I didn't watch it at the movies because I knew I'd have a hard time with it so I waited for the video. I couldn't even watch it at once. I had to do it in increments because it was just too emotionally wrenching for me, even at that age. I applaud high school teachers who show this to their students because of its cultural significance as well as as accurate a representation as you can get to seeing those horrific events in human history through film media. That being said, it's a hard watch and it stays with you for a long time after you see it. A very long time. When the little girl in the red coat hides under the bed and her coat changes to black and white... I just can't. You just can't handle the sadness (at least I couldn't). At the age I am now, I definitely understand and appreciate the film more, but I have only watched bits and pieces of it since. However, I still can't sit down and watch the whole movie. I was never a Spielberg fan, but this movie shows what a genius he really is. As a side note, Liam Neeson was robbed that year at the Oscars. He was no doubt best actor.",

It is a film with a heart. It is hard not to call it Spielberg's best film. There is one small scene that I never really found particularly satisfying and drags a little.

532,12 January 2015,jbohemier61,10, Best Movie Ever...Period.,"This is flat out the best movie I've ever seen. PERIOD. Its the most moving. Most horrific. Most true to life. Most in your face. Required watching. Nothing else comes close. This is the second time I've seen a movie in which nobody exited the theater during the credits. The first was Platoon (my second all time favorite movie). At the end of Platoon the audience sat quietly through the credits before anyone dared to get up and leave. But never before have I seen an entire audience rise in unison and give a standing ovation. And not for a minute or so, but during the entire length of the credits, as if Steven Spielberg himself was standing before us. Then absolute silence fell. Nobody could come up with the right words to say. We were stunned into utter complete and total silence as we stood absorbing what we had just seen, as if a modern day Mona Lisa had just been unveiled before our very eyes. BEST MOVIE EVER...PERIOD. Thank you Steven Spielberg for a job well done.",
533,16 March 2016,larsenib,8, Oskar Schindler: Good or Bad?,"At the beginning of this movie it was unclear to me whether Oskar Schindler was a good person or a bad person. Since he was German, my first instinct was that he was the enemy. However, as the plot progressed it was clear that he in fact was one of the good guys. He had an accountant who was Jewish but Oskar treated him like he was a human rather than a disposable creature. He also creates a list of Jews he wants to work for him and provides them with a safe work environment. He insists that he Rabbi carry out religious practices and take part in the sabbath. Schindler is unlike the other Germans portrayed in this movie, he is kind, accepting and overall a good person.",
534,6 March 2004,dbborroughs,6, Split Personality,To me this story of Schindler is a split personality of a film. On one hand its stark black and white photography and realistic view of life in the ghetto and the camp is a kick in the heart. The problem is what should have been a stark gripping in your face take on the Nazi destruction of those it hated is undercut by a classic MGM 1940's style photography in every other scene. I kept thinking one of the great directors of the period was making this and not Spielberg. To me it has always felt that Spielberg waffled on the subject because he feared what the reaction would be.,

Spielberg recreates the story of German businessman Oskar Schindler - a man that would not typically be associated with savings the lives of people, as far as the Nazis were concerned, considered to be enemies of the State.

Liam Nisan's character Oskar Schindler is complex as for me he transformed from one to another. After failing many a times in businesses, he finds 'the holy grail' of business i.e. 'War is the best friend for Capitalist.' Though he did not have an iota of feelings for Jews when he started business, later on his friendship; rather, professional coordination with Itzak Stern imbibes him with some feelings for them. To watch in the movie is how and at which point Schindler starts feeling for Jews is important.",
541,31 January 2016,linkin_park_radio_head,10, An Excellent Movie Adaptation of a BIOGRAPHY of A Man,"Judging a 1993 movie in 2016 &Especially that's been adapted from a Book is somewhat unfair to the Director Steven Spielberg(Who,being a Jewish,to my mind,will in anyway show Jewish in better light & Nazis as ultimate evil).World & Cinema & presentation of stories has changed a lot since 90s after all where producers & directors played to the Audiences & for their thrill rather than cater to an actual storyline. The fact that this Biography is set in backdrop of World War II & how HE viewed the events is somewhat taken away is overlooked too in light of the persecution of Jews & tragedy that a war is.""Things are omitted"" or ""It looks a simplistic version of a complicated,deep thing"" is often heard but it remains one of the best representations of Holocaust on movies ever.Point is,things get lost in adapting a book into a screenplay & Spielberg DOES add his own tidbits to make it more dramatic.If you want to explain how main characters, Oskar Schindler(Neeson),Amon Goethe (Fiennes)& Itszhak Stern(Kingsley) suddenly change colors or how they thought is explained better in the book rather than any movie that adapts the book.This review is keeping that in mind. It's a largely Black&white movie that attempts to make movie look bleak with Greyscale colors in 1993 to take viewers back to 1939 & that's an innovation worth commending.It also tries to make the story of the book into an narrative documentary about the people in it(not quite there,but does well enough). Story takes central character Schindler from Krakow,Poland to Auschwitz,Germany to his hometown,Zvitaw-Brunnlitz.He arrived in Krakow as failed businessman &with nothing & a member of Socialist Nazi party & a can-do attitude.He saw World War as a great profiteering opportunity with cheap Jewish labor from Ghetto settlement created after Blitzkrieg demolition of Polish armies.His investment in metalwork&enamelware is run by him after ruthless bargaining in goods instead of cash from ghetto&bribery of occupying SS officers & he employs his Jew accountant Stern to keep them in line with a similar philosophy.From there on,he changes a little&protects Jews in his employ,initially to protect his workforce & profits &later after imploring of his valued Stern(who uses Schindler's factory as cover to get ""essential"" workforce from oppressed helpless Jews,thus making them indispensable) &pleaders who approach him,once he's perceived as a hero & haven-provider due to Stern's efforts.His actual & final transformation into a sympathizer occurs when he witnesses violent liquidation of Krakow Ghetto by SS Army,in particular,by a little girl in Red in all the Black & white he sees running around & later on die once ghetto residents are ordered to move to Auschwitz.This is Liam Neeson at his best acting skills even if story itself seems to be clich√© towards the end. Best acting is however,by ever-underrated & great Ben Kingsley(overshadowed by other actors in native India as well as Hollywood) as Stern & a young,expressive Ralph Fiennes as SS Kommandant Amon Goethe.Only a book explains how stern was a real hero in background while giving credit to Schindler & escaping attention but Kingsley does that implied part justice.Also,Fiennes in a role of sadistic butcher who made a sport of hunting Jews is outstanding.His cruelty & hedonistic pleasure is even apparent in his hitting,yet protecting&loving a Jewish maid,Helen(Embeth Davidtz) who he wouldn't send to concentration Camp or wear a star. Apart from these central characters,story itself moves to given bleak series of events & cinematography which is excellent.It's a movie that deserves it's place & prizes in spite of better contemporary movies & as one of all-time greats out of Hollywood.That faceless ""Girl in Red"" is highlighted just to underline what it was that changed Schindler &Jews placing stones on his grave in the end to pay tribute in vibrant color(&thus out of bleak scenario)is a very 90's Spielberg idea to just simplify it to audiences & catch their attention.Deliberately put even if unneeded.An attempt to make a bleak movie lighter since it can't really be enjoyable.I liked it. Music&props in the movie are understandably full of gaffes if you nitpick.A 50s Billie Halliday's song playing in 40s or Krakow with post-war invented stuff is something producers will simply have to turn back time for.90s Krakow can't have 40's stuff lying around everywhere even in makeover.Most glaring one is the Railway with electric lines being used to transport Jews in prominent scenes.So,forget nitpicking & just see how great acting using those props & movie is.Kudos for a great movie & acting all round otherwise.",

545,11 December 2005,papadea1953,10, A Holocaust Spectacular,"If you could call a holocaust movie spectacular, then this would be the one. The Holocaust was a period in human history that should never have happened, yet it has become the most reported on in all of human history. In Schindler's List we see only a small portion of Hitler's ""Final Solution"", the plot to eradicate a segment of humankind from the face of the earth. We see a businessman who wants to make money out of war, dealing with a sick Nazi, who only cares about doing his duty, trying to survive a world war. Eventually we see how the Nazi mentality takes over the soldier, and how a man finally realizes the inhumanity of the regime he is serving. The fitting portion of Schindler's realization is when he holds the ""Nazi Party Pin"" in his hand and realizes he could have freed a few more people for that small piece of gold. This is a movie that all should watch and wonder how each one can contribute to the humanization of this world of ours.",

Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List. Me n my kids cried during the pit scene.",

A year later it is still amazing how much this movie impacted me. It's hard to put into words how perfect this movie was, which is why this review will seem very simple. Yet, I guess that perfect is the exact word for Schindler's List. It is beyond me how some people do not like this masterpiece or how some people do not think that the Holocaust happened. To the people who do not like this film, you do not know what a movie is and are probably to busy watching movies like Epic Movie. And to those think the Holocaust never happened, well than you just go on believing that BS, cause it did happen. All I know is that this is the only real movie that has brought me to tears.

It is far reaching, intelligent and historic and it addresses a sensitive issue in a meaningful way. The choice of black and white (with one hint of red) was brilliant and added a darkness that was truly dire. The film also gave a feeling of the European Jews and the Nazi's as human and not statistics. The Goetz was a psychopath but a lot of Nazi's were historically. The SS welcomed people with violence problems and obsessions. The whole regime was run by dark eccentrics and uber-patriots with a chip on their shoulder.

553,24 April 1999,Mr Lombardo,1, Black and White,"I've watched this film about half a dozen times over the last five years and I still don't really understand what Spielberg was trying to do.  Was he trying to outline the horrors of the holocaust or was he trying to examine Schindler himself - why the man did what he did? Maybe both.  In neither case does he succeed.  One can't help but feel the atrocities were greatly toned down for this film thus not really reflecting the true horror of what really happened, and he fails completely in exploring the character of Schindler.  Why did Schindler do what he did?  The man was a philanderer and a shrewd business man who didn't exactly go out of his way to be nice.  Did witnessing what he did make him wake up to himself or perhaps there was an ulterior motive?  Spielberg looks at none of this and serves up a modern day saint.  It is kind of ironic that Spielberg shot this movie in black and white because that is the approach he has taken to his subject material.  He gives us the saintly Schindler, the stereotypical evil Nazi, the honourable Jew and none of the complexities that made these people what they are.  This was Spielberg's attempt to become accepted as a serious film-maker but yet he takes exactly the same approach to making this as he did with his marvellous popcorn movies resulting in a rather dictatorial film that has more answers than questions!",

Because this movie was banned in the Philippines for frontal nudity we had to wait it out until the video came out. At first I didn't expect much, was even disappointed it was in black and white. The movie is so detailed, so graphic. It seems to tell you all the secrets that you will never read in any history book. The detailed part of other people's lives is what captured me. Most particularly about Amon Goethe and his Jewish love interest, which was bitterly ironic. He chose to even let her go in the end. While it was creatively written, it doesn't focus on Hitler at all. In fact I do not remember Hitler's face being shown in the movie. The movie is all about Herr Oskar Schindler. The other good part about this movie is that one can politely assume not ALL Germans are Nazis. Oskar Schindler had a very big heart for ladies as well as Jews. Because it was focused on Oskar Schindler, it doesn't attract contempt from people who think otherwise. It captures almost all sides of the war, from the Jews point of view and from the German's point of view. Never a dull moment.",

Schindler's List is the one and only film that explores the triumph of this one man who has saved generations and the film itself has become the most compulsive drama ever made. The most realistic thing about this epic is the camera work, in order to make the film look more realistic to the times, Steven Spielberg wanted the film to be filmed in black & white, the ending sequence was actually considered to be unusual as the survivors from the Holocaust do the vow to commemorate Oscar Schindler by placing rocks on his grave which is considered to be an old Jewish tradition.

World War II was very complex, to begin with, and when Oscar Schindler assisted with placing Jewish People in jobs, in order to keep them out of the Concentration Camps, that was the nicest thing anyone had done for them in a long time.

573,25 December 1998,Tet-5,10, Very impressive,"Everything about Schindler's List is impressive. Never before have I seen a more painful portrayal of the Holocaust. The horrible images about the humiliation, the fears and the pain of the Jews are combined with the extraordinary absorbing story about Oskar Schindler, great camerawork, music and acting, both from the principal characters as the minor characters. A quiet, but nevertheless very impressive scene was the one in which the personal belongings of the Jews, who just had been put on transport, were sorted out. The first time I saw Schindler's List, this shot just seemed to go on and on, and thus gave me an idea of the enormous extent of what happened to the Jewish people. We witness how war can bring out the worst in men, like it did in Amon Goeth. Men like him were given the power, the opportunity, to develop the evil qualities in their characters. Luckily, Spielberg didn't portray only the evil side of Goeth, he also showed his audience that this horrible man still was capable of feeling something for another human being, even though he didn't want himself to. Thanks to the superb performance of Ralph Fiennes, the Amon Goeth character is in every way believable. We see how war also can bring out the best in men, like it did in Oskar Schindler. Spielberg very subtly develops the relationship between Schindler and Stern. They both know Schindler's feelings changed during the war, but neither of them talks about that. But still, the audience knows, just as Schindler and Stern know. Liam Neeson was very impressive, Ben Kingsley gave one of the best performances in movie history. Many people say that Saving Private Ryan is Spielberg's best movie, but I don't agree. Schindler's List has much more depth, and touched me far more deeply. It's a real masterpiece. A tip: Read the book! It gives a lot of details Spielberg couldn't show us, because of the limited length of the movie. It's worth your effort.",
574,31 July 2013,stanko1987,10, A milestone in cinema,"This film IS a masterpiece! Spielberg infused his camera-work with urgency and attention to detail and he never strays away from horrific images, and then he films them just enough so they make an impact, never over the top... This is a rare movie which genuinely made me feel sad, happy, anxious and horrified in one afternoon, I can't think of an able counterpart... Late Mr. Ebert told in his review that Fiennes plays it too demented, as if the whole Nazi movement could be simply branded as evil- I disagree, it's subtle nuances in Fiennes's performance that show you how complex these characters really were.Cold, psychotic, resolute on the outside and torn apart with his lust for Jewish girl and the hardwired need to hate her people... It's incredible just how he pulls it off; In my opinion he made the movie, it wouldn't have worked with some other random actor.And not to say that I'm trying to justify Nazi movement, on the contrary, I'm only saying these people need to be understood and their actions put in a greater context, maybe Amon is a bad example, but a lot of those foot soldiers were just following orders. We can't just tag them as evil, as that's not enough, don't forget- they were able to seduce a complete nation, you can't do that just by playing evil, other factors come into play.It is exhausting movie to sit through, but in a good way, I would urge everyone ,as I have my complete family, to watch this milestone in cinema, such is its cultural impact... Only by watching this film and then dissecting it, can we truly appreciate its message- we are not born evil, we become evil when we fall under someone's spell and who intricately covers our eyes, by blaming everything that is wrong with our world, onto someone who is an easy target and can't defend for themselves...

Even though based on a book by Thomas Keneally, Steven Zaillian puts in a lot of effort mingling the originality of the book with the actual events of Holocaust. Brilliance begins from the very first frame of the film and doesn't end until the end credits. Liam Neeson delivers a wonderful performance, very believable. Ben Kingsley offers an equivalent performance. Ralph Fiennes is very good in his role. The emotions portrayed in this work of art are tremendously related to every human that exists in the world.

I was twelve and even then I was impressed. This also managed to bring out some of the greatest acting I have seen. Liam Neeson was perfect for the role. He brought strength that no other actor could. Ralph Fiennes was at least equal if not better. He created one of the greatest villains in history. Yet he brought the human touch to the role. It was the saddest movie that I have ever seen and the most important. Spielberg has created a masterpiece that will be remembered for many years.,

594,20 April 2005,Silver_Dollar,10, Excuisite cinema,"The film which centres on the courageous deeds of a German industrialist who shelters his Jewish workers from impending death is one of the finest films ever made. Not just because it was about the holocaust.Even if one were to divorce the Holocaust from the film - or put it more simply, as holocaust deniers would have us believe that it never happened - this simply remains one of the finest executed films . Right up there with other greats such as Amadeus. The decision to shoot the film in a quasi documentary black and white style is skilfully handled by the cinematographer Janus Kaminski, and for the whole three hours never lets the attention wonder off. The screenplay brilliantly explores the complexities of Oscar Schindler showing his zest for life and his humanity, and the arch Nazi Amon Goeth cannot hide his attraction to his Jewish maid whilst harbouring hatred towards her race. The film intricately shows how Schindler starts his factory from nothing, peddling money from Jews from the ghetto, succeeding as an Entrepreneur and then deciding to sacrifice all of it to save his workers. The interplay between Schindler and the various Nazis who he charms and bribes is brilliantly performed by Liam Neeson. Sir Ben Kingsley gives a fantastic low key performance as the keen accountant who quietly paves the way for more workers to be protected within the factory under the nose of his boss. The score by JohnWilliams is definitely a career best as is every aspect of the film.",

I was appalled at the scenes included in this movie, and they were both cold and moving at the same time. This is the best movie I have ever seen. If I had been in a room with a hundred of my peers, swearing to laugh and taunt me for life if I cried I would have still wept. Two of the starring actors' performances were definitely grade 'A'. Liam Neeson puts on a flawless performance in my opinion, as does Ben Kingsley. However, the performance of Embeth Davidtz (cast as the maid, Helen Hirsch) left me disappointed, as did Raplh Fiennes'. As far as story goes, this is a moving and powerful one, that ought not to be forgotten. I wish I could touch on the specific parts of the movie that moved me most without spoiling any of the ending.

Of course, all would or should be struck by the horror of the holocaust. To be shocked, dismayed, angered or otherwise deeply bothered by the inhumanity of the Nazi treatment of the Jews - fellow human beings, is normal for people who haven't themselves lost their humanity. But, along with that, people may be moved by or see one or two main themes in this film. Other movies have been made that show the atrocities of the Holocaust. And, some other films have been made about rescuing and savings Jews during the war. This film is unique because it is about a Nazi who undergoes a complete turnaround.

Eric Roth's screenplay really did deserve the Oscar, and I was shocked how this film ended when Ralph became a good character after the deaths and cry from the Jewish people.

Most even cried (myself included), due to the realistic Holocaust story. The film takes place, of course, in WW2. Starting in 1939, a German man named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) comes into quick fame at a Nazi private party, using only his money and suave manor. With help from high-ranking Nazi officers, he starts up a pots and pans factory to help the Jews work. After a few years, when we have seen many Jews massacred and shot, Schindler makes a list of Jews, to be escorted to a German arms factory in his home town, and saves them from a trigger-happy, power-mad Nazi officer (portrayed by Ralph Fiennes).

627,30 November 2012,tooraj-jamal,10, Summary of others reviews in my opinion,"1. Oskar Schindler (played brilliantly by Liam Neeson, ""Batman Begins"") was a Sudeten German industrialist, a wealthy womanizer who wasn't afraid to throw his money around. Always bearing his Nazi Party badge proudly, Schindler would often frequent nightclubs, extravagantly showering high-ranked Nazi officers and their girlfriends with champagne and caviar. With impeccable connections in the black-market, there was little that he couldn't get his hands on, and he was a good person to know. Buying friends was something that Schindler could do well, and he would often use these newfound alliances to aid his own business ventures. When thousands of the Polish Jew population was relegated to the Krak√≥w Ghetto in 1941, Schindler saw an opportunity for further success, enlisting desperate Jewish investors and employing Jewish workers (who were substantially cheaper to employ) to open an enamelware factory. His connections in high places ensured lucrative army contracts, and Schindler need only have watched as his personal fortune grew, despite doing little to run the company beyond offering it ""a certain panache.""",

629,26 June 2013,gladys_fox12,10, Powerful Statement about our Times,"This is not just about the past, it is about our present as well. We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country.",
630,11 April 2010,rjm11,9, There is no word to describe this,"A well made and well thought out piece of work. Overall, I can say this worked in black and white when it's been done to death in other films. Direction, Production value and the Acting is nearly unparalleled. I will not mention names as all deserve equal credit for an outstanding performance. The most interesting bi-play for me was between Schindler and Goeth. As the story progresses Schindler tries to suppress his humanity for the sake of profit and Goeth tries to suppress his evil for profit. Throughout this Schindler cannot deny humanity and tries to force barbarity out as this is the only way he will survive. Goeth, perhaps, realizes the evil and tries to force out his humanity only to realize that his barbarity is the only way to survive in the regime he is in. The struggle goes on, and, I think at the end both men realize they have lost. By far for me the most interesting character is Goeth, as you can see sputters and sparks of enlightenment trying to come through, only to be dismissed. If you can watch this movie and not shed a tear, let me know, I will check you for a pulse. This film, while perhaps not a documentary is still a testament about something that should never be forgotten, much the same as Saving Private Ryan is about the combat troops (Schindler's list is not a war movie IMHO) in the European Theatre of WWII. This movie never lets up on you, there are no moments of levity to save you from an account of a dreadful time in history. Not to be missed.",

It has such a powerful message and one that needs to be understood better. The film itself is brilliant, the acting is superb and the music is so moving. The film doesn't hold back at all and includes everything that the Jews has to go through back then. It really gives you a clear image of the pain and struggle they went through. I admit that watching this film was very difficult and struggled to reach the end but it was well worth it. I had to pause and just think of something happy mid way because it started getting really depressing. Steven Speilburg truly is an artist and really captured the realism of the holocaust. I would like to watch this movie again and it is definitely one of my favourites. However I would not recommend this movie for young children. If you are a teen you might be able to handle it but anyone under shouldn't watch it as some of the scenes are pretty horrific and I'm a little bit surprised it isn't an 18 but I can see why it's a 15.",

This film does not have a false note in it's execution scenes, storytelling or acting.

This beutifull masterpiece also is filled out by John Williams fantastic score that touches your heart. If you don't like this movie (or find it boring) you do not have any compassion to fellow man.

(3) To really drive home the point that this is an IMPORTANT film about a SOMBRE topic, fill it with enough repetitive scenes that it lasts nearly as long as WWII. (4) Rinse. (5) Repeat.

This is a contender for the greatest film ever put to screen - this is not an overstatement. This was one of those rare instances where a film moved me on such a profound emotional level. In telling one man's story of selflessness during possibly the greatest human caused atrocity ever done to our own species, the Holocaust, Spielberg is able to tell a story that is not intended to entertain, but move audiences. In every sense of the word, Schindler's List is an experience, it is more than just another movie you sit on the couch and watch. If you didn't ball out your eyes watching this then do you even possess a soul? At it's core, it is an example of the little glimmer of hope that is surrounded by hopelessness, it is the showing of the value of life. the real Schindler's List was and is much more than a list, it meant living when others died. I have seen horror films that are fake but are able to hold up my suspension of disbelief, but with this piece of cinema I was shown maybe the scariest thing ever filmed - what happens when prejudice and discrimination lead to violence. If you haven't seen this, go and rent it or buy it and cherish it as something not to repeat in our future here on planet Earth.",

The perfectly accurate depiction of the persecution and execution of Jews is indeed heartbreaking and moving. The portrayal of Schindler, who transforms from being a cold, egotistical, greedy bastard, who only cared about making money, profit, into a selfless, giving person who worked very hard, and gave everything to save as many people as he possibly could. The film also perfectly and chillingly depicts how the Nazi's threw the Jews around, shoving them around, shooting them if they felt like it, for no reason. ",

655,28 May 2014,juggermat,10, One of the best movies I've ever seen,It was not surprising when a name like Steven Spielberg is printed on a film cover to be so sensational and mind-blowing. The film could be called a masterpiece which is compelling due to fabulous acting of Liam Neeson at his best. Not to mention that the whole concept of the film only came to realize when Ralph Fiennes force you to comprehend the abstract meaning of humanitarianism.Apart from the actors and their glorious plays the storyline was sad and drama but worth even ten visits.When a conceited businessman gradually changes during his war life and decide to help his workers to survive you can feel the true story that lies behind the movie. Thus if you have not seen the film yet I strongly recommend watching it as soon as possible.,

Provides great understanding of the politics, ethnics and morals of German Society in the 1940's. A great insight for anybody that wants to have some background of the holocaust or just an idea of what the situation was like despite being in the perspective of a rich business man that profits off Jewish workers.I enjoyed the movie a lot and would recommend it to anybody else interested in history. :)",

658,11 October 2006,praveen1013,10, It couldn't have been better,"When I first learnt about Schindler's list, I had great expectations on how Spielberg would have made the greatest ever human tragedy. I expected big shots like Hitler, Himmler, Eichmann... but Spielberg had made the movie with stern, Helen heitsh, schindler and goeth. When I first saw the movie I thought Spielberg had missed quite a lot of incidents. I thought some scenes in the first 1 hour could have been cut to accommodate other incidents and I felt the movie was overrated. But only after watching the movie a second time I realized that the movie was 'Schindler's list' and not a documentary on holocaust. I also appreciated how important each and every scene was and got convinced that there couldn't have been a better version of the movie. While scenes like burning synagogues would have been sensational, It would have provoked outrage. But Spielberg had given this movie an emotional and human touch. Schindler's transformation from a corrupt flirt profit-minded businessman to a great saviour has been fabulously portrayed. This movie, though not a great tearjerker, has a lot of emotional dialogues and scenes.",

Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes give towering performances as the title character and a frightening Nazi commandant, respectively and Ben Kingsley is just as impressive in a quieter role. John Williams's wrenching score and Janusz Kaminski's excellent photography complement the writing and directing of this incomparable drama, in my opinion, the finest film ever created. May Spielberg live in glory for showing the world what horror lived behind those textbooks and what strength can emerge from that horror!",

It shows the depths to which humanity can sink without God. I recommend this movie, but with warnings. It contains penury; shows violence of nature; and the subject matter is about one of the most hideous times in recent history. However, it is all in the telling of this true story; a story that should be told. Exactly, not a film for children.",

665,19 September 1999,alex-306,6, Overrated!,"It's not that Schindler's List is a bad movie; in parts, it's quite powerful.  What has always annoyed me about this film, however, was the way it was so unreservedly embraced by critics and unsophisticated moviegoers. Seriously, am I the only one who was unimpressed by the main ethical point of the movie? Really, what does this film have to say beyond, ""the Holocaust was a bad thing?""  I'm sorry if I don't consider this to be groundbreaking, cutting-edge historical analysis.  Furthermore, am I the only one who was offended that Spielberg made a fundamentally ""feel good"" movie about the holocaust?  Was I the only one that was offended by the fact the film ends by dedicating itself to the six million Jews who died in the Holocaust (and about the five million non-Jews who also died you say nothing)?  Did anyone else notice how the main characters in Schindler's List were not actually Jewish, thereby following in the grand Hollywood tradition of turning the story of oppressed people into the story of a sympathetic member of the oppressing group (a la Cry Freedom, Mississippi Burning, Beyond Rangoon, and so on)?  What really offended me, however, was an issue that, in all fairness, was peripheral to the film itself.  I was infuriated by the way Hollywood patted itself on the back for making a movie it hadn't wanted to make, a movie it should have made decades before.  Schindler's List was made about forty years too late, and at its core is the same innocuous Hollywood nonsense that has pervaded the world of cinema for far too long.  The memory of the members of my family who were murdered during this tragedy deserved better.",

Spielberg's films are now more like the corny ramblings of grandpa in his dotage where good people are really good and bad people are bad and even people who are in that grey zone are given a black or white role in the end.  It's all quite tedious to watch.",
667,26 May 2016,lecrae_fanatic,10, Perfection.,"Unlike the film, I'm going to make this review short and sweet. Schindler's List is the single greatest film I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. It has brilliant casting with Liam Neeson taking on the role of Oskar Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, and Embeth Davidtz as Helen Davidtz. All four put on outstanding performances, but personally I'd say Ralph Fiennes gives his best performance of all time in this film. He displays the beautiful struggle of a man who does the unthinkable without thinking, yet behind closed doors fights with an inner turmoil. The cinematic decisions made in this film also pay off brilliantly. The choice to keep a large portion of the film in black and white adds to the authenticity of the piece, yet the subtle colouring of the little girl in the red dress adds emphasis just where it needs to be. Aside from all the details, the story is one of few that really got to me, and in the end that is why I must say it is the greatest movie of all time.",

671,4 December 2008,rachel_d_walker,8, A compelling must-see,"This film is long, tedious, graphic, disturbing, and well worth watching. Although there are some critiques on here that claim the film focuses too much on the ""positive"" (if you can say there is such a thing in the midst of the Holocaust) it would be a very different and much less watched film if it was 193 minutes of the worst moments in the history of the Holocaust. It does not sugar-coat the atrocities that occurred, in fact there are many graphic and undeniably violently disturbing scenes. However, without the hopeful stories of those that Schindler saved, the film would be unwatchable. There is an honest depiction of the horrible things that occurred in the Auschwitz, but there is also a story of hope. One that doesn't discount the atrocities that were inflicted on the Jews, but also leaves you with some faith in humanity. The story of a greedy, powerful goyem, using his power and money to save all of the Jews he can from Auschwitz is incredibly moving and is what makes such a depressing film worth watching and prevents the viewer from leaving the experience with a sense of total depression.",

First off, I have to say that the cinematography in this film is beautiful, and the acting is off the charts. Liam Neeson gives a heartfelt performance, and Steven Spielberg's directorial skill give this movie and edge not to be messed with. I have to say, this movie touches your crying spot with the final scene, showing all the surviving members of the List. Absolutely amazing film. Another comment on cinematography was the girl in the red dress. I applaud Spielberg's choice of allowing her dress to show, highlighting her in the crowd and the later when bodies are being loaded, her dress shines bright among the dead. This proves to be the catalyst that makes Schindler's quest all the more important. The last act when all the Jewish people are freed and Schindler goes on the run, one word comes to mind for this...Enthralling. Liam Neeson hits the character spot on, and his heartfelt sentiments at not being able to save more induces tears in your eyes. Bravo. Bravo.",

He then trades these goods and ends up making an awful lot of money. He employs Itzhak Stern (Kingsley)as his accountant and ultimately his 'right hand man'. Whilst he is clearly exploiting his workers, they don't mind as they would rather work for Schindler than be under the brutal regime of the SS.

But as the story progresses he begins to see the human side of whats going on, not just the profit margin. After learning of the hardships of those imprisoned, and of the murderers who control the camps, he begins on a quest to try and save not only his soul but the soul of everyone around him, and to keep the flame of humanity lit during the dark destructive reign of Hitler. This is without a doubt the best film of Liam Neeson's career as well as the best film of Steven Spieldberg's career.

If you were to put each Best Picture Winner in the 90's up against each other and vote to see which movie people thought was the best, it would assuredly win. Words simply cannot describe the power of this movie. For an even better movie experience, read the book ""Night"" by Elie Wiesel before viewing this film. You will then gain a better appreciation for Spielberg's attention to every detail, and you will instantly sense the realistic power and importance of every scene. Its ending brings goosebumps to me even after viewing it several times. The acting is superb, the details and authenticity are unmatched, and the movie is sheer brilliance. In the long list of smashingly successful Spielberg films, ""Schindler's List"" ranks at the very top.",

Can an esthetic form be used to describe its antithesis? What should be the purpose of an artistic rendering? Spielberg has proven that the artist can convey the impact of this event that leaves a lasting imprint on the viewer. By selecting an isolated event, the fate of the 1,000 Schindler Jews, Spielberg allows an oblique glance at the vast enterprise of this historically unique genocide. The understated tone of the picture and the brief allusions to the well-known horrors of the time,while concentrating on a small group of protagonists allows the viewer's imagination and emotions to experience the atmosphere of the time in a profound way. The most gripping scene is the evacuation of the Krakow ghetto. During the mayhem of soldiers, gunfire, attack dogs and terrified victims a small girl walks through the black and white scene in a spot of color. Six million victims are not fathomable, but one little girl can represent them all. Spielberg has shown the power of art to describe the indescribable.",

This is down to my gut feeling that the film sugarcoats many events , especially the eponymous character . Remember the scene at the end where Oskar Schindler gives away his goldnes parteiabzeichen in order to finance the saving of some more lives ? It`s a very touching scene but in reality this badge would have no value , so how is this explained ? Very easily - The holocaust happened but that scene didn`t. And I find the character interaction somewhat cheesy between Schindler and Stern . It`s like Stern`s manipulating Schindler while Schindler is making it clear that he doesn`t need manipulating because he`s going to save as many human lives as possible . It`s like the film is trying to say only someone who is good by nature can benefit humanity , an almost insulting simplification and rose tinted view of human nature . This is why I enjoyed Ralph Fiennes performance as Amon Goeth so much . He`s a Nazi murderer who shoots woman and kids , but Fiennes plays him not as an inhuman goose stepping monster but as an all too flawed human one .",
703,28 November 2000,feverdeang,1, spielberg is a MOVIE maker NOT a filmmaker,"I think IMDB was invented for me to get this off my chest, S.Speilberg is not a FILMmaker as in film as art. SS is a movie maker,a talented hack who's success has gone to his head. Jurrassic Park, great escapist fantasy,Raiders, handed to him on a platter by Lucas, Jaws, brilliant horror,Close Encounters, a virtuoso UFO riff. In Schindlers List and Amistad we see two oppressed groups, the Jews and the African slaves are unable to help themselves without help from the oppressive white man who is subjugating them to begin with! Wouldn't a story about the Holocaust or Slavery be more satisfying if it showed how the oppressed helped themselves instead of implying that THE STORY to tell about this particular period of history makes the victims unimportant, interchangable, of NO consequence except to motivate the ""HERO""?? Also who is reading these scripts? Isn't the little girl in the red coat the SAME plot device( I don't even know what to call it, motif, ornament, twist??) as having Tom Hank's character release the german soldier that ultimately kills him.?!?

Everything about it was done with great care and great respect for the 11 million victims of the Holocaust. The acting was also done with care and respect.

707,29 September 2017,leahtinclair,10, My Response to Schindler's List,"What I learned about the Holocaust in the film 'Schindler's List' is that it teachers us about the horrors of the Holocaust and the nature of genocide. It also gave me the insight of what happened by showing a horrific number of deaths. The movie was shown through the eyes on the outside(Nazi's) and then through the eyes on the inside(Jews). This gave me more of an understanding. The first stage of the Holocaust was 'definition'. Jews were forced to wear the Star of David and shown as a threat. The second stage was 'segregation'. Jews were now forced into ghettos. The fourth stage was 'concentration camps'. Jews were sent to these camps to work and do free slave labor. The fifth stage was 'extermination camps'. Gas chambers were disguised as showers. By 1945, six million Jews were executed. The final stage was the 'aftermath'. Camps were liberated.",

714,19 March 2018,ckbarbour,9, Steven Spielberg's best work to date,"Zephaniah 1:15: That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of Shoah and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness. It wasn't until today that I could appreciate and understand how well that verse described Steven Spielberg's 1993 movie Schindler's List. It made me realize this was not just a movie about Oskar Schindler, but a tribute to the Jews deep religious devotion and conviction that made it possible for them to be strong to enough endure the hell they went though and give them the faith to believe in and trust in a man like Oskar Schindler. This was just not about genocide but about a religious prosecution that rocked the world on its foundation and that still has a bearing on World Religion and politics today. 
Schindler's List comes to life in war torn Poland, where the Nazi's had invaded and taken over. They have ripped the Jews lives apart piece by piece. They had been told they had to leave their homes, most of their belongings and register their families in the big cities. Upon their arrival, they were humiliated, harassed and herded off like livestock to live in an overcrowded, run down ghetto community. This is the true story of how their lives and the life of Oskar Schindler became a part of that dark part of history together. Liam Neeson played the role of Oskar Schindler, a materialistic opportunist who was a part of the powerful Nazi party member. He became acquainted with Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) a Jewish accountant, to get the capital, he needed to open his Polish Factory, Deutsehe Email Waren Fabrik. As the horrendous treatment of the Jews escalated around Oscar and his factory's future started to unravel, the relationship between him (Liam Neeson) and Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) changed from that of an employer, employee nature to that of a friend or confidante. As the movie progressed the audience saw him evolve from the opportunist individual he was in the beginning, to the man he became in the end. He risked everything to save their lives, the lives of those whose name was on his list, Schindler's List. They called themselves Schindler Jews, they honored him in life and in his death for his sacrifice for them. Whether a person is a Steven Spielberg fan or not, this story needed to be told in order to honor Oskar Schindler and the brave souls that lived and died during and after the time of the Shoah.",

The cinematography beyond spectacular. Can't say enough about this one. Loved the black-white effect. It made the movie more bleak, dark, horror of the Holocaust. John Williams' musical score is wonderful. Schindler's List is a film that everyone should see and appreciate to its fullest extent.

732,1 June 2014,onno1996,9, My review of Schindler's List,"Schindler's list gave me some insight on how Jews were treated out of concentration camps in Nazi Germany. This film is about Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who starts a company making silverware using unpaid Jewish labor during the Nazi regime. Overtime as Schindler develops empathy towards his workers. Schindler moves his factory and his workers back to his hometown in Czechoslovakia and waits till the war blows over. During the process of aiding the Jewish people, Schindler spent millions of Reich marks in order to feed and save 1100 Jews. This movie The Nazi soldiers would abuse Jews by cutting their hair, push them around, or even killing them. Jews were forced to wear a Star of David and were obliged by law to inform German men that they are Jewish. This film shows us how Jews were forced to change their usual practices in daily life. This is depicted in the scene where Schindler tells the Rabbi that he should be preparing for the Sabbath since it is Friday evening. This is also seen when the Jews are celebrating and they break the glass. Overall I believe that this was a fantastic film that was very educational about the Holocaust and the Jewish faith, and also an inspiring humanitarian.",

Firstly, the plot of this film is interesting because it based on real story about man who tries to save lifes despite of fact that he could be killed for this. Secondly, the cast is wonderful, all actors did their work perfectly regardless of the amount of screen time. Of course, the pair of two brilliant actors: Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes did one if the best performance. At the film they have a kind of psychological duel.

739,18 August 2014,ajaysingh0402,9," Leaves you stunned and mesmerized, with your mouth agape","The Holocaust during World War II forms the backbone of the plot in this highly-acclaimed, heart-touching movie. Oskar Schindler is introduced as an opportunistic and avaricious businessman, who hires Jews as workers merely because they constitute cheap labor. But, soon enough, his greed is subdued by his attachment to them and he plans to save them from Hitler's persecution, even if he has to throw away his hard-earned savings as bribes to the Nazi officers. A very commendable job by the writers makes the character come alive very convincingly. Liam Neeson cannot be given any less credit for portraying the protagonist and Ben Kingsley as Stern adds a cherry to the cake. But, the portrayal of the setup actually used by Nazis to slaughter the Jews, makes the audience shiver with fear and disbelief. The detailing and hard-work put by Spielberg is quite evident in the scene where the Jewish children try to elude the Nazi soldiers by hiding in places inconceivable to any ordinary man. Another such instance is when the Jews are transported in trains, huddled like cattle without enough space to take even a whiff of air. ",

He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. However, in 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. Soon Schindler demands more workers and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people from likely death. Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture and a long-coveted Best Director for Spielberg, and it quickly gained praise as one of the finest American movies about the Holocaust.",

This movie not only informs you, but it also shocks you and makes you think about yourself and the whole human race in general.  What makes me sad is that there are people who didn't like it or even detested it; these people, I believe should watch it again to grasp the importance of this film.  This, I beleive is the greatest movie of all time.",

It is everything a movie should be. I recommend this movie to watch, but it is not for the faint of heart. The horror it reveals of the actual holocaust is something the faint of heart would most certainly be torn from. It's true. This is what happened. And this is a movie that truly reveals it exactly how it went.",

758,20 July 2016,gscoufoglou,10, An absolute depiction of WW2 darkest days,"What made Schindler's list special to me, was the authenticity that is displayed throughout the movie. Till I saw the movie I thought Nazis were an army of fanatics, with a psychotic commander. Through the analytical and accurate recounting of the movie I was intrigued to ask questions I never thought I would. Acting of all the actors make you feel the movie, make you want to learn what really happened, make you want to understand why. There are plenty movies based on true stories and I think I have seen enough of them, but none of them had affected me that much. In most cases I would put myself in the main character's shoes and think how I would react in similar conditions. In this case I didn't even bother, I thought I wouldn't manage. What made these feelings though so strong and vivid, were the acting, the directing, the very well done research over historical events, even the idea of shooting the picture B&W I think made more realistic. I hope I will have the chance to watch the movie once more and I wish we will be able to watch movies of equivalent quality in all its aspects.",
759,26 February 2023,PartTimeCritic,10, A Masterpiece Film - Required Viewing,"There's a scene near the final act of the lengthy Schindler's List where Oskar Schindler, a German factory owner, and his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern are creating a list of names - the titular ""Schindler's List."" The list of names are the Jews that Schindler is paying Amon Goeth, the commander of the Plaszow concentration camp, enormous sums of money to bring over to his factory instead of shipping to their deaths at Auschwitz. After finalizing the list, Stern removes it from the typewriter and says to Oskar, ""This list... is an absolute good. The list is life. All around its margins lies the gulf."" It's a beautiful and moving sequence showing the journey Schindler has made so far in the film. I think it's one of the best sequences in all of cinema. To understand why, we have to start at the beginning of this film. Schindler's List begins its narrative with Jews departing from a train and walking up to attendants who are making lists of their names as they enter the Jewish ghetto of Krakow. In this case, to be on the list is to be inferior and controlled by the state - less than human. This sequence is contrasted with Schindler's introduction at a German dinner club where he pays large sums to wine and dine Nazi top brass. He's doing it to network and get approval to start factories and get military contracts. In this sense, names on a list, signatures, are everything to Oskar because they are just a means to an ends - his wealth. Schindler arrives in the Jewish ghetto looking to take advantage of the situation, using Jewish cash as capital to fund his factories and using the Jews as workers because they cost less. Stern: "". . . The Jews themselves receive nothing. Poles you pay wages. Generally they get a little more. Are you listening? . . . The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing."" Schindler: ""But it's less. It's less than what I would pay a Pole. . . . Poles cost more. Why should I hire Poles?"" What's the value of a Jew to Schindler? Very little - they are just a quicker way of achieving his personal goals. As the story progresses and Schindler encounters Jews and observes their treatment at the hands of the Nazi authorities, he undergoes a slow change. It happens in subtle ways at first, but then it becomes more and more obvious until he arrives at the moment I described at the beginning of this commentary. You may be asking, how is the story of a German factory owner a good ""holocaust"" story? I think the key here is that Schindler's character journey both hyper focuses and personalizes the journey the viewer makes and allows us to observe a broader holocaust story than is often presented. By primarily following Schindler and the development of his factories, it allows us to take the journey of his Jewish workers from their quarantining in the Krakow ghettos, to the liquidation of the ghetto, and to their lives in the Plaszow concentration camp; while also observing the German view point of a businessman, and the commander of the concentration camp itself. The director, Steven Spielberg, masterfully portrays these events - with a directness, verisimilitude, and perspective that still has the power to stun me on repeated viewings. I often feel like an observer thrusted into real life events. The liquidation of the ghetto, the cruelty and random violence of life under Amon Goeth (a chilling Ralph Fiennes) in the camps, and the horrors of Auschwitz are now forever embedded in my mind. Like Schindler who observes the treatment of the Jews mostly from a distance, the viewer watches people on a screen. We too must grow to care for them. We have been told about the holocaust in our schools (hopefully!), but they are just words on the paper, maybe a few pictures. Schindler's character arc mirrors the arc this story is attempting to give to the viewer as well. After we view what Schindler views, know what he now knows, will we grow to see these people as humans with value or will they just remain names on a list in history? There's a reason the movie goes out of its way to repeatedly find situations where they can say the names of as many of the Jewish workers as possible. The creation of the list of names to be saved I described at the beginning is the moment that demonstrates Schindler has given up his previous views: to use the Jews as a means to his end - riches. The list demonstrates that Schindler has grown to know that a human life, each one, is sacred and not a means to an end. That he must sacrifice the thing that meant the most to him, his riches, to demonstrate this is poetic. This isn't the last time Spielberg has used the conceit of a list of names to depict whether we find value in a human life - think about it: in Catch Me If You Can Frank's ever-changing name showed his lack of integrity and peace with his self-worth, in Minority Report the pre-cogs produced a ball with a name of a victim and a perpetrator, in The Terminal Victor Navorski seeks to get his name on a list so he can enter the country, in an inversion of the list of life Munich starts with a list of names Avner must assassinate and he comes to realize it is dehumanizing, and in Lincoln the President demands the right amount of names to vote on a bill to end the de-humanizing practice of slavery. I could write much more and I fear that what I've already written is nowhere near worthy of this film. It's one of the greatest films of all-time and one you definitely should not miss. To paraphrase Stern's comment to Schindler in the film, ""The movie is an absolute good. This movie is life... all around its reels lies the gulf.""",

There have been many films made from WWII material, but none with this sense of power and desolate emotion.

His goals are simplistic in the outset, make money and use the Jews cheap labor to do so. Progressively as he witnesses the horrors of the Holocaust, so vividly brought to life by Mr. Spielberg, his resolve as a businessman deteriorates, and his drive to save lives is bolstered by things almost unknown.

770,1 March 2010,jakeslankard-670-918173,10, Beautifully Crafted Masterpiece**Spoiler**,"I just saw this film for the first time and I have never felt so touched by any other movie, and I'm only 15. It was so sad and heartbreaking when you see all the cruel things the Jews had to go through, but at the same time very uplifting when you see how far one man is willing to go to save these Jews. Especially when you see how he cries his heart out when he learns that he could have saved one more life by putting her name on the list (the maid/servant that Goethe liked, I think?) I had previously seen a few Holocaust movies, particularly liking The Pianist, but Schindler's List has much more of an emotional depth and impact on you when you watch it. For instance, when the two guards took away the old man with one arm, I knew he would be shot, but even when I saw it, I was still horrified as if I didn't know. To think that this really happened, and for so long, makes me believe that the only possible reason God allowed this to happen, is to show us good people how to defeat true evil and to make sure that it never happens again. I liked the color scheme, especially with the girl in the red coat. I saw her just almost waltzing through the liquidation, minding her own business, and the whole time I was thinking, ""How is she doing this? Is she even real? Or is she just a figment of Schindler's imagination meant to represent how the Jews will persevere through all this horror?"" I thought at first that Schindler looked like sorta a bad guy: how all he was concerned with was making money rather than saving lives. But after seeing all the burning bodies being carted out, he had the ever-important pang of conscience. The rest is history. I believe that Spielberg has created something that can never be matched in ours or any lifetime. I wish I could personally meet him and shake his hand and say, ""Thank you for making Schindler's List."" It's a real eye opener into human perseverance, be it in trying to survive (Jews) or in trying to save as many lives as possible (Schindler). This is one instance where the movie was FAR FAR better than the book, which I have read and will re-read. That 3 hours it took to witness flew right by for me, and I will be forever happy that I took those 3 hours to see it. Steven Spielberg will forever more be remembered for some of his other masterpieces like ""ET"" and ""Jaws"", but I will always remember him for Schindler's List.",

Liam Neeson as Schindler is absolutely astounding and as is Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern. Their performances are by far, perfect. Embeth Davidtz is amazing as Helen Hirsch. She gives the viewer a million reasons to shed tears. However I was most taken up by the performance of Ralph Fiennes who portrays the chilling Nazi officer Amon Goeth.

777,31 December 2005,songrider64,9, Shindler's List Still Quite The Film!!,"There has been so much written about this film but I wanted to touch on areas that I found quite impressive and I might have some minor reservations. Ray Fiennes playing the Nazi Amon Goeth was astounding. Yes, he was sadistic but that is only part of it. The scenes he had where you saw into his eyes and there was nothing there. I have know idea how Fiennes pulled that off but it was dead on and I suspect it was probably closer to reality than any other actor to play a Nazi. Usually, actors who are not the nationality of the characters they play sometimes are betrayed by their own appearances if only slightly. That was not the case here. Both Fiennes and Neeson are Irish, but I was thoroughly convinced of the characters they played. This Schindler really looked Czech. Goeth really looked German right down to the eyes and that is why Fiennes should have won an Academy award for his performance. It was so stunningly convincing. I will agree with most of the comments on this film about the excellence that went into producing it. I do however, have one regret that the film does only covers the suffering of the Jews. This is not the fault of the film but a general regret that although 6 million Jews suffered in the war, 3 million Poles and million upon millions of Russians also lost their lives in the war. There are so many stories of tragedy and heroism out there. Let Schindler's List not only stand for the Jewish plight but for all who lost their lives at the hands of the Axis powers.",

Not just for Jews but all the countries that was in this war. But obviously Jews suffered more than anybody. They were killed, massacred inhumanly just because they were Jew, just because their religion different from the majority where they live. I am not a Jew or any relation any Jewish organization or Jewish party. This is the reality, this is what they faced and what they lived. I also do not ask that who is to blame. Just imagine, as of today; what were happen if all of this inhumanity held place today? Alli ask is that people in Palestine has a Schindler? Does not children there deserve a chance? When Schindler's Jew forget what they suffered? How they do not to take no notice of killing that is happening right in front them? Just simple little question.

It took me a long time until i finally see this movie, just because i dont like ""favourites"" (like Game of Thrones for example"". I couldnt be more wrong about this. Filmography is excellent, the black and white adds a great sense to the background and what can i say about the true story that the scenario is based on? What a brilliant acting from Liam Neeson. Why didnt he continue the legacy he left after this movie. So sad. Totally recommended, but because its a movie that will put you in thoughts, i would recommend you to see this alone. We, and all the next generations should see this movie and maybe even show this in schools as education.",

801,3 August 2012,massivepinch,10, The finest picture ever made.,"Spielberg is one of those few men who manages to strike Gold with most things he does. Few would deny his qualities in directing motion cinema, and the many triumphs he's achieved with all genres of film. But with Schindler's List surely we have his greatest. The precision to every single frame of this movie is endless. The staggering scale and scope of the story telling, of which we see a businessman (Schindler) making a high level living from the Nazi war machine, who in the end uses his entire wealth to save has many human beings as possible. And that is this films triumph its human tale. A film which is as uneasy (in parts) to watch as it is equally beautiful. It is not a comfortable movie and not for everyone, but those who appreciate true cinema, incredible script and story telling, perfect direction and impeccable acting there can be no greater. Ralph Fiennes as the wickedly evil Amon Goeth is spell binding, a part which must have been difficult to play is played to perfection, in which for me is Fiennes finest performance. He plays the part so perfectly you would believe you where watching an actual piece of footage of the events. And indeed this was Spielberg's idea behind the black and white theme, to allow the audience to experience the film as if it was historical evidence. A film which asks questions about the depths of the human ability to carry disgraceful acts of violence and horror, and the mindset of the ones who can no longer standby and say they did nothing to stop it. All the acting is perfect in this movie, Neeson excels and plays Schindler with a grace and coolness that few other could execute. To sum it up every time i watch this movie it gets better, but to call this a movie would do it an injustice, this is a Picture, a nod to the old days when detail was everything, but with the pace and the brilliance for it to last forever. There was never a finer one made. Spielberg's greatest. Film makings crowning glory.",

And I get around. I have seen A LOT of great movies. Liam Neeson (as Schindler) is phenomenal, except for one minor, over-dramatic scene, Ben Kingsley is (as usual) fantastic, and Ralph Fiennes does a frighteningly good job of being evil. The movie is beautifully filmed in black and white in order to be consistent with the time period, but there are a few artistic splashes of color for meaningful, symbolic ideas and images.

The holocaust did happen! Watching it in a theatre for the for first time, the audience was completely silent as the credits rolled at the end with only a few leaving. When I composed myself enough to get to the car, I burst out crying. My grandfather escaped the Warsaw ghetto (he died shortly after I was born). My father who was older than my mother, grew up, in part, in a Japanese prison camp and was stamped (he went away when I was 10). So while you'd think I'd know more about my heritage and all my family killed in Poland by the Germans, I do not. I only heard bits and pieces. So when I saw it come together in a way that only Stephen Spielberg can do, it hit me--hard. My family endured this and only a few survived. I believe regardless of heritage, that everyone should see this film to know what could happen in the future-again. The fact is, it is happening today in North Korea where daily acts of unspeakable cruelty happen. It's a must see film for the acting, the authenticity and the truth. NEVER FORGET!",

The glances, the body language, the tension between the actors... I can't point out exactly what it is with these things that give the movie such credibility, I can only say that it -d-o-e-s. A black and white movie about the Nazi-regime might sound boring, or a bit over the top in being serious and dealing with an important issue, but in this case the director did a great job. It's not boring. It doesn't seem like a documentary, like many films about these events does. Still, knowing that the plot is based on a real story really makes you feel like this film is reality.

Set in World War Two, this movie is an exceptional display of the true nature of war. Although there are gory bits it is a very true account. Another good thing about this film is that it is a true story based on a real person Oskar Schindler who i believe was a war-time hero. To be able to rebel against such a man as Adolf Hitler would take a lot of strength. The scenery in the movie is very fitting to the story and is a large part of the movie. Anyone who doesn't have a weak stomach should see this film. It has a great storyline which will captivate you until the very end.

The movie starts out with you seeing him visiting a mass burial of dead prisoners. After seeing the little girl in the red coat being wheeled to the mass graves and also seeing how the guards treated the prisoners, Schindlers attitude towards the whole holocaust was changed. Through out this movie you can really see a conversion of a man with high power and wealth into a man who dedicates his money and time, even risking his life, to help save his prisoners from a common fate in which most of the prisoners at the time faced.",

After ten or so minutes the room was silent. I remember when the film finished you could hear a pin drop. The reason for this was that Spielberg left nothing to the imagination, he showed every detail such as the one-armed man being shot while clearing the snow, the girl in the red coat on the pile of burning bodies, I could go on. I think that the most moving part was at the end of the film when the actor and the actual person put a stone on Schlinders grave, at that point, I could see that some people in the room were close to tears.

837,14 June 1999,tech-3,10, One of the greatest films yet made.,"The mark of a truly great movie is defined by its cinematography, script, characterization, acting, and directing. Schindler's List soars in these categories.  A film of this stature leaves an indelible mark in our minds and souls.  The haunting images of man's inhumanity to man juxtaposed with the essential goodness of man linger long after the last reel ends. Each frame exquisitely tells a ""thousand stories"" with their great attention to detail, clarity, composition, and camera angle. Coupled with John Williams amazingly poignant musical score, each and every scene infuses itself into our consciousness. In addition to the incredible cinematography, music, and story, the acting was clearly driven by a deep and heartfelt conviction of character by all of the actors.  Especially notable performances were delivered by Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes. In the modern age of special effects and high action films, this film renews the truly great creative potential of some of our filmakers.  Mr. Spielberg took a bold step when he decided to finally make Schindler's List.  Shooting the film in Black and White further emphasizes the boldness and greatness of this film.  Like its great B and W predecessors ""Citizen Kane"" and ""On the Waterfront"", Schindler's List clearly takes its rightful place as one of the greatest films yet made.",

Steven Spielberg's directing for this movie is unprecedented- the use of black and white (with only two elements of the film appearing in color) delivers the message even more clearly than color would have.

Spielberg made it as a personal film for himself and other Jews affected by the Holocaust. There is nothing flashy about the film except for Neeson's bravura performance. Spielberg's usual style is invisible, and the cinematography and editing, although excellent, are not shown off to make a spectacle of the film or give it an epic feel. Yet it is still a compulsive, involving, and utterly heart-wrenchingly moving filming of a part of history that should not be forgotten. The screenplay is one of the best ever written: it captures the stories of so many Holocaust survivors but without distracting from the main story at hand. The black and white photography and editing is perfect, and John Williams provides a perfectly subtle but nice music score. The acting is simply brilliant, with Liam Neeson towering as Oskar Schindler, and Ralph Fiennes bringing out the Nazi character Amon Goeth into full flesh. And Ben Kingsley and Embeth Davidtz give off excellent performances too. The film also has a lot to say about absolute power corrupting and spiraling out of control, and such a message of the film can be applied to any time and crisis, not just the Holocaust. This is not just one of the the ten best films ever produced, but it shall remain so for years to come, because its messages in terms of power and racism are applicable in any age.",

Schindler's List is a black and white movie to make you feel that it was a dark time in our world's history. There was only one time color was used and it was used to follow a small girl. I wonder how he really felt after the war and the madness was over and he ran at the end of the movie.

Brilliant score from John Williams with haunting violin solos from Itztak Perlman. What a cast. Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley. All portray their individual roles with such passion.
The black and white filming makes the movie, with just the little girl in the red coat showing through in colour. Then you see her on a Trailer, Dead. She's gone.
One of the most frightening scenes is at Auschwitz, when the women think they are about to be gassed. Spielberg has you thinking you are in the room with them. No wonder he won an Oscar for direction.

852,5 April 2016,marianabulhoes20,9, A film about war and friendship,"Schindler's List is an amazing film about war and, at the same time, friendship. Spielberg did a wonderful job; of course he had help, the fantastic cast and photography helped the creation of this epic. Liam Neeson's Schindler is very human, and you can identify yourself with the character. He's ambitious, but he never gets what he wanted: to be rich. He moves to Krakow, Poland, to take advantage of the situation, and be a success businessman, the Jews were under increasing pressure from the Nazis. He was very opportunist, selfish, and manipulative, at the end of the film, he becomes a totally different person. Ben Kingsley's Itzhak Stern is also amazing, he's a very strong character, a character that you can feel compassion and, you hope that he can be fine by the end of the film. That's one wonderful thing in the film, you care about the characters, even if is for a brief moment on screen, like the little girl with the red coat. The photography is stunning, all black and white, like a documentary, you feel like you're watching a History Channel's documentary, but, more real and with an amazing direction. In conclusion, Schindler's List is a great film about war, and one of the bests films Steven Spielberg ever made. A wonderful epic that you can see a despicable man turn into a better person, which helped more than one thousand Jews from certain death.",

Even with movies like JAWS, Saving Private Ryan, Jurrasic Park, E.T they don't have the same class as Schlinders list. The movie is made in white n black and not many movies are made so now days and that he had the courage to do it and manage to win a Oscar. The movie makes you really think back to the past with the black n white and the places that he's been filming that makes our minds go flash back to the old good times. Yet there are some mistakes as the most of the directors and actors make. He makes this movie to much.. if you understand he makes it the Spielberg way that means that he loves the action scenes but he hasn't been using it as he did in Saving Private Ryan.. He makes the action go good with the picture ""the piano scene (Ghetto) "" ...",

This movie truly is the best war film of all time. This film just might even change the way you look at life.

At first, he did not intend to save them, he was only interested in money, to buy jews to work in his factory, and make him money. But lately, we see Oskar change his mind, and secretly, saving the most people as he can. It wouldn't be bad if Martin Scorsese had accepted the offer to direct this feature, but Steven Spielberg shows the story in a magnificent directing, cinematography, screenplay, score and performances.

Spielberg clearly depicts how unfathomably callous Nazi soldiers were during this time period. One especially poignant scene has soldiers scouring the ghetto looking for children who were in hiding. Each time they find a child they riddle them with bullets. As this goes on, two soldiers take a break and listen to a third playing the piano and talk about what composer's music the third is playing.

862,26 November 2004,oscar_girl_audrey,10, Best Movie Ever Made!,"In 1942, a German Nazi named Oskar Schindler developed a business, in Krakow, Germany. It was managed by a Jewish man, Itzchak Stern, and populated hundreds of working Jews. One day, the workers and the living Jews in the ghetto were overruled by invading Nazis, led by Amon Goeth. They were evacuated and taken to a concentration camp near the ghetto. Devastated by the loss of workers, Schindler demanded to Goeth that his workers be released immediately. But not so; Goeth told Schindler that the Jews were to remain in the camp. Determined, and self-willed, Schindler opened a business near the camp, and made a list of Jews that could work there. The list was only meant for a couple hundreds, but eventually became a list with one thousand and eleven Jew names on it. The Jews were shipped out, and worked until the end of the war. Afterwards, at midnight the day World War II was strictly declared over, Stern and some friends made a letter of evidence that Schindler was innocent, and a ring out of a Jew's tooth, with the words ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"" inscribed on the side. It was at exact moment that Schindler learned that not only did his factory become successful, it saved the lives of Jewish victims. ",

No other film has come close to evoking that sort of reaction from me. The performances are superb and the the direction breathtaking. A story everybody should be made to see. Criticisms of the final scene are, in my opinion, unfounded as it humanised the whole story and made it hit home how one man's actions saved and affected (and created) so many lives. I doubt Spielberg will hit this height again but that's OK. I would be proud of this as my towering achievement. It's a shame that that the DVD did not have more in the way of special features.

What I have observed more as specific talent and skill of the director is mood and tone of the film being transformed to the audience; heartbreaking sequence of the film where Jews are moved toward the gas chamber and moments later where the smoke comes out is utter shock and depression which we as audience feel it, also the camera shot choice and composition makes the sequence identical.The hand-held camera in some sequences has achieved the aim of the filmmaker to engage the audience into story shift between objective to subjective point of view. For instance where the Jewish women being run into the chamber and the doors are locked on them, apart from the suspense of being burnt in the chamber which we see is not the case and they have shower, the audience feels the tension and terror in the scene.",
867,5 February 2007,shashanc,10, One of the greatest and most important films ever,"Without a shadow of a doubt, Schindler's List is the finest film Spielberghas ever made; it is also, comfortably, the most important and is a movie everybody should make an effort to see, not just because of it's quality as a film but because of the message it carries with it. Everyone must surely now know the basis of the film - war profiteer OskarSchindler, a Nazi party member, works to save the lives of over a thousand Jews during the Holocaust, risking his own life in doing so. It is a story that, told incorrectly, could have been overly sentimental or that could have failed to make the points it needed to make about the Holocaust.Instead, it is told so well, it transcends the boundaries of it's media and has become both a vital historical document, cataloging the terror of the Nazis in a way everyone can understand, and a salient warning for our future. The strength of the film lies in the fact that it makes no attempt to preach to the person watching it. The primary characters are painted in shades of Grey. Schindler is a womanizer, a drinker, a profiteer who seemingly puts money before morals much of the time. He laughs and jokes with Nazis, including the primary villain, Plaszow commandant Amon Goeth,who himself is never presented as entirely evil. Throughout, the viewer is presented with a document of the actions of the characters and left to make up their own mind. Spielberg shot the film in black and white, often using hand-held cameras,to give it the appearance of a documentary, and it works. Coupled with the realities of the characters, and the fact that Spielberg neither draws back from the brutality of the Nazis nor uses the script to preach about it, this gives the film ""the ring of truth"". One of the hardest things in film-making is to take the truth, make no major changes to it and then make it believable on the screen; here Spielberg succeeds in this totally. The central performances in the movie are immense. Liam Neeson, RalphFiennes and Ben Kingsley give utterly convincing performances in the lead roles and the scenes where they appear with each other pin the film together and carefully chart the development of Schindler's sympathies.They are the final link in a film that has no weaknesses. This is a dark film though - how could it be otherwise with it's subject matter? It is upsetting and deeply moving and anybody who watches can'help but be changed in some way. The emotional climax of the film, in Auschwitz itself, is one of the most harrowing scenes ever put on celluloid. Spielberg handles the ending wonderfully as well, avoiding cloying sentimentality but still managing to provide some hope after all the darkness that has come before. The final scene, involving some of the people Schindler saved, is profoundly moving. If you haven't seen this film and are considering buying it, do so. Quiteaside from the fact that this is one of the finest movies ever to come out of Hollywood anyway, it also stands alongside books like 1984 and TheGrapes of Wrath, and films like The Battle of Algiers, as being""entertainment"" that is far more important than the genres which spawned them. The 2-disc set is beautifully packaged, and somehow this seems important for once. There is a deeply moving documentary included featuring interviews with survivors from Schindler's List. The transfer of the film to DVD is excellent as well - clear, bright and smooth. The choice of starting point for the second part of the film on the second DVD is also well made and poignant. For those who wish to further their knowledge of history's darkest hour,the best starting place is Martin Gilbert's book The Holocaust. Alsorecommended are Primo Levi's books If This Is A Man, The Sixth Day and IfNot Now, When; Roman Polanski's film The Pianist and, in music, Gorecki's3rd symphony and Shostakovich's Babi Yar. Equally important is another Martin Gilbert book, The Righteous, which catalogers the actions of some of the 17,000 other people so far recognized by the Council of Yad Vashemin Israel as righteous people who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. All these works help further tolerance and understanding,as does Schindler's List and that, surely, is the film's greatest credit and testimony.",
868,15 March 2015,tanja-mahmoudkhan96,10, Love it,"Review on Schindler's list The highly emotional movie Schindler's list (1993) is inspired by the novel ""Schindler's Ark"" by Thomas Keneally, that was based on real events. During World War II Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jews through the use of powerful nazi friends. Holocaust survivor Poldek Pfefferberg was one of the jews that was saved by Schindler and he inspired the Keneally with his first hand experience of these events. The film, which is directed by the epic Steven Spielberg, has received seven Oscars and is also rated seventh of all movies ever on the site IMDb, which I think shows how great this movie truly is.",

But maybe my view is skewed by the fact that I have actually seen other movies that deal with this subject -- from ""L'Enclos"" (out of print) to ""The Pawnbroker."" ""The Pawnbroker"" is a devastating indictment of man's inhumanity to man. ""Schindler's List"" pales by comparison.",

I think that this movie is suitable for kids 12 and up if they are watching it with their parents. Also remember that is film is based on a true story. Schindler was a man who helped the Nazis in many ways (suplying weapons etc)but he did not think that what was being done to the Jews was right so he helped many of them who are still alive today and many who left their children to tell the story.",

I recommend this film to anyone who has any interest of knowing what happened during the holocaust and what the Jewish, the polish, and all the rest of the groups of people who were forced to experience the horrors had to live through. No film has ever hit me with such powerful emotion before. I can honestly say, as a guy, that I cried when I saw Liam Neeson's face when he saw the girl in the red dress dead in the cart and when Shindler broke down in the end when the Jews he saved gave him the ring with the line ""he who saves one, saves the world entire.""

This is the story of Oskar Schindler who kept over 1,000 people alive during the Nazi reign. Liam Neeson is phenomenal in his role as Schindler. What I like it the faded splash of faint color in the little girls red coat; the rest of the movie is black and white, which only adds to the impact of the total emotion of this fantastic film.

I bought this movie on a hunch that this one would be different. Well, it really wasn't, but I can't deny the absolute perfection of such a blatantly Hollywood movie. In typical Spielbergian fashion, the movie lifts you up and throws you down throughout, but never enough to make you very happy or sad, but at the end... The end is where the real kick is. I've never seen such a blatantly obvious attempt to make a person cry, but, even though I tried not to, I still did. It was an impossible temptation to escape.

884,31 May 2020,roythedog,10, Powerful,"This movie and Hotel Rwanda are very similar and although I found Hotel Rwanda to be more sad and heartbreaking, that doesn't detract anything from this movie. The plots of the two movies are remarkably similar however. A kindly but opportunistic businessman tries to make his way but the world begins changing around him. He is a member of the bad guys and has a close friend who is a leader of them. However, he begins to witness the horrors of what's actually going on and makes it his mission to save as many of the victims as he can using bribes, manipulation, and his connections. He saves all the people he intended to save but still feels guilty he couldn't do more. I respect Spielberg for refusing to hold anything back and for sacrificing profits and royalties to respect the victims and the touchy subject matter. Spielberg didn't pull any punches and made a realistic scary and moving movie about the true horrors of the holocaust in Poland. This movie does something not a lot of pieces of media can do. That is show you through actions instead of only words the emotion and rawness of what's truly going on and how the characters in the movie feel. It doesn't focus entirely on Schindler either, it also shows what was really going on at this time, the nazis going through the people on the train's stolen luggage and the horrors of the sorting and separating and how cold the nazis were about separating families without any mercy. Overall a solid 10 out of 10. Although it didn't move me as much as Hotel Rwanda did, that doesn't make this movie any less good.",

The cinematography, the music, the acting are monumental. I can't remember the last time I have felt so touched by a movie. The scene in which Schindler is leaving the camp to flee the allies is emotionally gut wrenching. He is truly a man transformed. The plight of the children in the camps as depicted in the film is particularly awe inspiring. To see them separated from their mothers and while others hid in the toilets was almost too much too bear watching. This movie should be watched by everyone for generations as a reminder of the evil that man can perpetrate on man but that one person can make a difference if they are willing to be ruled by love.",

I'm a Spielberg's fan since i was little and i can say it is one of his most beautiful movies. The scenography so good and the music too, it expresses well every moment of the story. The movie is in black and white but we can notice only one ""point of color"": a child, (the one with the red small coat among the crowd of other Jewish) after killed by the Nazi. The innocence that dies. The actors are all good and appropriate in personifying their character. I think it's a movie everyone should see for ""understading"", for how much possible,the tragedy of those times, and to know well the great figure of Oscar Shindler. The first time i saw it i was too young and maybe i did not comprehended it totally, also because for some strong scenes. But now, at distance of time, i can say to love this movie.",
905,13 May 2008,haolu9850,9, history cannot be forgotten,"War is always a heavy topic. This world has been darkened by two world wide wars, and there are so many lessons we need to learn from them. Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, has once again brings us back to the vivid scene of the most disastrous holocaust that ever happened in human history. This is really a good movie. Watching the movie is a mental process of seeking what is human nature. Strong emotion aroused in me when I watch it for the first time in class. For lacking of a better word to express, I only find the feelings choked in my throat. In the beginning of the film, the Jewish people around a table were having their traditional religious ceremony. A candle light sparks amid them. With the light diminishes and finally goes out, the film turns into black and white, and the evil darkness falls upon the Jews. Then this film goes on in black and white. Someone may wander why the director had to make it a black and white film. In my opinion the director made it on purpose. The gray pictures show audience a kind of depression and seriousness. At that period, the dark clouds of death covered the Jews' sky. The color of life has gone; the color of civilization has gone. To be frank, watching this three hours long film in black and white makes me feel uncomfortable, but is this feeling just like what the victims felt in those days? Being in the darkness for so long, they are really eager to see light---the light of hope, and they are longing for color---the color of life. The film let the audience experience this feeling in these black and white pictures. Based on the true story in World War‚Ö°, this film tells us a story about a German business man, Oscar Schindler, tried to save more than one thousand Jews and other victims from the Nazi Germans. Oscar Schindler used to live a luxurious life with great ambitions in his business. He was a devoted member of the Nazi party and was in close touch with the Nazi officers. The war provided him a good opportunity for his business, thus he wanted to get every possible benefit from it and decided to manufacture military need products. Just because the Jews are the lest costly labors available, they were brought to work for him. At first when his Jewish workers were killed by the soldiers, he was just angry because it made him lose money. One day, with the words ""today is history"", of Amen, the chief officer of the German troop, the holocaust began. The noise of machine guns was never stopped in that day. The blood of the Jews flooded the streets. Oscar Schindler, who was riding a horse in the wood, happened to saw the killing from the hill. In the mess, he saw a Jewish girl running in the street. In this black and white film, only the girl was in red. This color makes her different. I think the director must indicate something to us. What does this color mean? Does it represent blood and anger of killing, or passion and hope of life? I kindly thought it was hope, but in the later part of the film, we saw the girl in red again among the bodies to be burnt. When I watched the film for the second time, I realize that had not for some good people like Schindler, no one can survive under the beast like Nazi. After seeing the holocaust, Schindler changed. He tried his best to save the Jews. He bought over 1000 lives from the devil. Through the long list with the type machine clicking, we see the light of hope again. In the final of the film, the war ended, and the picture turned to color again. The world is bright again. This is a movie worthies watching for everyone. We should never forget history. Keeping history in mind does not mean keeping hatred in heart and revenging, while forgetting history means betrayal to all humankind.",
906,7 June 2008,wendy0422,9, Director has an equivocal attitude.,"the director's point of view shown in the film is something more than that of the Jews. Rather his point includes that of the Germans at the same time by focusing mainly on the storyline of the German hero 'Oscar Schindler'. This whole plot clarifies his intention to make the film hold a balanced view of two sides. Thus, It escapes from a dichotomy which the Jewish people as the victim may easily fall into; beautification of the Jews and demonization of the Germans.",

Performances by Neeson, Fiennes and Kingsly are fantastic and memorable but I think Fiennes delivered the best performance of his career as the heartless, psychotic nazi officer Amon Goeth, his scenes steal the screen and are the ones you won't soon forget after the credits roll.

It takes an inside look at what really happened while they were in the camps. Also, how disrespect to any German soldier or any one that was loyal to Hitler resulted in extreme punishment. Extreme punishments such as death were not uncommon. Schindler, in the beginning, was only trying to make money. As the war went on he realized what was really going on in the factor. As he grew closer to his workers in his factory, he didn't want to make money anymore, he just wanted to save them from the death of the war. He began to spend the money he had to buy the workers back from the camps and tried to save as many as possible, he became broke by the end of the war. Before leaving his workers at he end of the war, he cried because he felt guilty because he felt like if he sold his car and some of his belongings, he cold have saved even more lives.

923,3 April 1999,marie23,10, Beautiful a masterpiece.,It is a rare occasion for me to cry during a movie. However this movie moved me to tears. I believe everyone in the world should see this film. Liam Neeson does a wonderful job in the portrayal of Oskar Schindler. Ralph Fiennes does an excellent job as the Nazi Amon Goeth which he has said is one of his toughest roles because of the complexity of the character. One of the scenes that stays with me is the one with the little girl in the scarlet clothes walking down the street in the middle of a Nazi Aktion. It really shows you that these horrors must not be forgotten. There are many people who deny the Holocaust or just don't care. I believe that we should try our best to keep these memories alive if we are to have hope for the future. That is what this film does thank you Steven Spielberg.,

I think that this is probably one of the most informational movies of all time.  The sad part about it is that Oskar Shindler really did help the Jews, but only for his own personal gain.  The German leaders knew this, but the tiny number of Jews that he saved did not constitute an emergency on their part.  Good movie!",

Main roles and extras are playing like never before. This is a must see film, involving every aspect of life and death itself. The war is bad but also beautiful with its strange aspects and turns. The situation and all the scenes in the film are unique and the atmosphere catches you from the first moment on. In one moment you will stop realizing this is a film and will totally dive into the whole feeling of being a part of that altered reality. Definitely a film, that should be watched with a nice party- from beginning till the end! Happy watching! Enjoy!",
933,8 April 2006,ladyblondebex835,9, A brilliant way to capture the moment,"I have visited Krakow in Poland where the film was mainly made, the atmosphere there was distressing and to be able to capture that equally as emotive through a camera shows genius. I loved the entire film straight through, it promises to draw tears every time without fail. A must see. The film also portrays the sadness of the camps better than being in the camp in person; i have been to auschwitz and berkenau myself. I think Neeson plays schindler excellently, he has the charm to demonstrate the real Schindlers nature with women. I also thought at first that black and white films were not appreciated in the modern age, however, this film shows that black and white can work, you would not get the same effect from the film if it were in colour.",

936,1 June 2000,riverdavis12,10," With Schindler's List, Spielberg completely shattered the limits of what I thought film can do.","Schindler's List is by far the most powerful and profound movie going experience I've ever had.  No other film I have seen even comes close to the kind of power generated by Schindler's List.  Spielberg did things with the medium of film that I never dreamed were possible.  Somehow he managed to raise the artform to a transcendant, supernatural level - something that no other film in history (at least that I have seen) has accomplished. Citizen Kane may have set the standard for film, but Schindler's List completely shattered it - breaking free of the realm of normal movie making.  Viewing Schindler's List went far beyond a merely passive experience of viewing a poweful film - for the first and only time I can remember, I was living the experience in a way that is almost inexplicable to me.  It was a truly awesome existential and spiritual experience.  There are single scenes in Schindler's List that are more brilliant, profound and powerful than entire films I have seen. There are sequences and images that haunted me for years afterwards and still haunt me.  To this day I get choked up and tearie-eyed when I recall certain scenes or images to memory.  Apart from that, the film is brilliantly shot with the best black and white cinematography I have seen since Citizen Kane.  The screenplay is remarkably subtle and the performances are first rate all around.  Liam Neeson, who has amazing screen presence, was the perfect choice to play the character of Oskar Schindler - a man who is likeable and charasmatic, but ultimately mysterious.  And Ralph Fiennes was mesmerizing as the evil and complex Amon Goeth character.",

938,17 April 2004,allie-hearts-canada,10, Best portrayal of the Holocaust,"I've researched the holocaust greatly, and have watched numerous movies about the Holocaust. Schindler's List has to be the best movie I've seen on the topic. The frank presentation of the violence and indifference of the nazi officers is amazing. Perhaps the most intense scene is when the Schindler's Female workers are sent to Auschwitz instead of his camp. The presentation, music, and cinematography make it one of the best scenes in any movie I have seen. All of the acting is fantastic, but I find Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Nazi Camp commandant Amon Goeth stunning. Also well acted is Embeth Davidtz in the role of Helena Hirsch, the jewish made of Goeth. He shows both the evil and human sides of the man, and acts them incredibly well. The cinematography is wonderful. Overall, this is a must see movie for all people interested in history.",

By horrified, I don't mean that all of a sudden, a killer comes from out of nowhere and hacks off someone's limb, with blood and guts all over. No, I mean the true horror... from the fact that what you watch really happened sixty years ago. It is a film that just leaves you without the ability to speak. To walk away from this film dry-eyed is to not be human. Many 'Best Picture' winners are actually overrated... Chicago?... A Beautiful Mind??... The English Patient???... to name a few recent ones. Yet Schindler's List is not overblown, and for all its praise, is still underrated, for it deserves better than the best recognition. This is not just a film... not just three hours to while away your time. This is a lesson in humanity. Schools everywhere should make this part of their curriculum for High School, to teach the future leaders of the world what mankind is capable of. It's not what we could do. It's what mankind DID.",

It's a really long movie, but one does not feel the time, as every scene and fact being told was important. However hard the subject, the movie is brilliantly and beautifully made. Kudos to the director and all the actors. The story of Oskar Schindler is phenomenal. The suffering of all the people is unimaginable and heartbreaking, who suffered at the hands of crazy animals. The story is amazingly told by Schindler's Jews and Mr. Thomas Keneally. Without their efforts in narrating the story, this movie would not have been possible today. Mr. Steven Spielberg has brilliantly picked up the most important bits and made it into a movie. The screenplay is commendable. Every actor has done justice to their characters. Specially a great variation from Liam Neeson, as the story progressed. Addition of the little girl in red coat, is very well used for the sake of the movie. It shows the exact moment, which changes everything in the movie. The movie picks up from this point and you are glued to the screen.

The movie has been directed in an awesome way by the epic director Steven Spielberg.

A Must-See flashback, what you won't forget.","This MOVIE (with all big letters) is one of the most beautiful, and horroristic pictures in the whole world. All of the actors have given their most perfect and powerful performances in their filming career. Ralph Fiennes gives us a breath-taking skill of being a lazy, brutal and ruthless, but still a calculating commander of the Jewish camp, and Ben Kingsley, who plays the accountant of Oskar Schindler, almost made me cry (I never dropped tears for a film), when he gives his tenets up (as a Jewish man, he can't drink alcoholic drink), and ask Schindler to give him a whiskey. I think without John Williams' music, this film still could be good, but when you hear the Piano Theme, it will make your soul heavy as a hammer, and you can't think about other things, just the Cruel Reality of the World in the WW2. Steven Spielberg has done a very-very good and exhaustive directing, with all the Black-and-White effects he used and controlled, like a work of art. This film grabs you, climb in your soul, and then won't get out of here until you watch a better movie than this. (it's impossible). Howewer the screen is black and white, the quality of sounds and the effects is cutting edge, and you can fell that you're there next to Amon Goeth, or one of the characters. But these words are nothing, you need to watch this movie to recognize it's true meaning, otherwise, this comment is nothing, it can't bring back the feeling of this picture, and you only will know, how great film is this, when you watch it with your own eyes. Congratulations, Steven Spielberg, you made an instant classic, which is recommended for ALL people in the world, at least for an one-time view with it's three hour playtime, but when you watch it, you grow up.

Extremely deep and meaningful and the casting was phenomenal, music choices were great and the overall feel of the film was emotional. There were many great choices made by all parties, being the director and actors as well as the designers. All these parts inside the film made me as an audience member feel as though i was really there experiencing these tragedies. The use of black and white was very powerful and showed how dreadful these things were, the end had a very dense and intense core and I loved it, highly recommended for any fan of this genre.",

958,11 April 2007,kl-lindheim,10, The best movie in filmhistory,"No doubt is this the best movie ever made. It's a unforgettable movie. It's a strong and demanding movie, but every second is pure art. It takes you three hours in history and hell. Liam Neeson is perfect as Oskar Schindler.Ralph Fiennes is amazing as the nazi-psycho Amon Goeth. He shows authority and is very frightening. Ben Kingsley is also great but his performance is in the shadow of Neeson's and Fiennes'.",
959,15 March 1999,Graham_Millar,10, Objet d' art,"Schindler's List is unquestionably the finest re-enactment of Holocaust horror there can ever be. Dubious historical accuracy aside, it's infinitely more important for the audience to recognize how perfectly the film duplicates the emotional impact of the Holocaust. One cannot feel such fear, shame, rage or love for humanity through any other means. To see this film is to witness the full potential for human good and human evil, side by side. To weep as you watch is not to fall prey to the director's manipulative imagery, but to acknowledge the abhorrent events of the time. You can watch it any way you want; my recommendation to take the fullest advantage of the magnificent craft employed by the director is to let yourself be placed right inside it as you watch, without fear or trepidation.",
960,6 June 2004,kinzer1958,10, A MUST for everyones lifetime,This movies should be mandatory for high school and collage students. They could replace Greek mythology and teach real history. History they we should never forget. Schindler's List!!! The movie has a very powerful story. The facts are backed up with hours of interviews from the survivors. The pictures and story that cannot be put into words has made it to the screen for everyone to learn from. If you know someone that has not experienced this movie. Make sure they see it even if you have to rent it for them. Our family has watched it at least 8 times I never tire from it. Each time I learn something new. And now the box set is the Best with so many extras. Our school library's should keep this in all US school from JR>High on.,
961,3 March 2010,Geeky Randy,8, Certainly a movie to judge for yourself.,"The critically acclaimed epic story of a Nazi (Neeson) who witnesses the atrocities bestowed upon Polish Jews during the brutal Nazi Reign. Ooh, Spielberg is so genius with his use of coloring and his pulls-no-punches portrayal of WWII! Just the type of film Hollywood loves to pat themselves on the back for and tell themselves that they're edgy and honest. However, the reality is, the use of symbolism in this film is so shallow, even a sixth grader can interpret its meaning. What's the point of symbolism if there's nothing to search for? It seems a bit redundant, because any meaning behind this film, aside from the ugliness the Jewish people endured during WWII and the sacrifices Schindler made, is there on the screen. There's nothing to search for. There's no ambiguity for each individual to take something personal away from it. The symbolism serves no purpose. Not to mention other Spielberg flaws; he underestimates his audience¬Ö as usual, and continues the story when its finished¬Ö as usual. Keep in mind when watching that not everything in this ""masterpiece"" is historically accurate. Ralph Fiennes chooses to play Amon G√∂th as a theatrical villain, rather than a three dimensional evil and twisted man. Christopher Waltz makes Fiennes look like an amateur as Hans Landa in ""Inglourious Basterds"". That's another thing, why is this in English? Is it so Hollywood doesn't have to read subtitles, while the rest of the world has to? Certainly a movie to judge for yourself.",

963,2 January 2014,saruncr,9, heart touching filim nice making,"after watching this felt like we were there in some corners in second world war.A very beautiful, epic and dark story about courage and the desire of living, a masterpiece made by Steven Spielberg this is one of those films which if you didn't like it, you have got no heart.Because this film touches us so deeply, the catharsis has a power that few -- if any -- other moments in film history can match. And that's what establishes this as a transcendent motion picture experience.The film's ending brings me to tears. At the end of the war, Schindler's Jews are in a strange land--stranded, but alive. A member of the liberating Russian forces asks them, ""Isn't a town over there?"" and they walk off toward the horizon. The next shot fades from black and white into color. At first we think it may be a continuation of the previous action, until we see that the men and women on the crest of the hill are dressed differently now. And then it strikes us, with the force of a blow: Those are Schindler's Jews. We are looking at the actual survivors and their children as they visit Oskar Schindler's grave. The movie began with a list of Jews being confined to the ghetto. It ends with a list of some who were saved. The list is an absolute good. The list is life. All around its margins lies the gulf.",

It is based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally, an Australian novelist. The film is based on the life of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Schutzstaffel (SS) officer Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.",

974,26 May 2013,i-sophiamary,8, It's a perfect movie that one should certainly watch,"The movie revolves around the war period between Germany and Poland. The movie begins with how the Jews are homeless and forced to shift into ghetto. Meanwhile a young man named Schindler is in search for riches and fame. he hires Itzhak Stern as his accountant(who later becomes his Jewish eye), with an aim to start a business of 'pots and pans'.He hires the Jews for their cheap labor. With time, the atrocities and violence against the Jewish people keeps growing. Amon a brutal German general makes life a living hell for them. But Schindler is determined to help the perishing people. The movie is beautifully directed. On one side there is this monstrous war and on the other, the heart of a kind man, celebration and the hope of people.",
975,3 January 2016,nsganapathy,10, Simply an Awesome movie and a masterpiece..!,"Exceptional!! Schindler's list is perhaps the best and most heartbreaking depiction of the Holocaust ever, It's a dark and heart breaking tale of one man's journey to become a hero to the Jew's of today, Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler a greedy factory owner who hires Jew's to minimum wage work for him. Soon enough he has all the money in the world and is happy as can be. Or so it appears, as the film progress you see the demeanor and attitude of Schindler change dramatically when he watches the Jewish people get slaughtered like animals by the Nazi's, after that he sets his heart on the sole task if getting them out of the camps and into his country. Schindler's List is the proved example of human kindness and compassion, It's a movie that will make your heart break and make the spirit soar at his heroic feet. Schindler's List is one of the greatest films ever made and will continue to shock and amaze people for all time. I very highly recommend this movie!",

Our class watched this in high school to prepare our characters for the Diary of Anne Frank. The film leaves you speechless. Breathe taking! Such a horrific story of fear and death. This bold narrative pulls at your emotions to reveal hope and compassion. Beautifully mastered. Honestly one of my all time favorites. I wish we could see more. I would love to work on a production as powerful as this one. John Williams' perfectly composed original musical score, compelling. Schindler's List is a film that everyone should see and appreciate to its fullest extent. Spielberg will remain an immortal filmmaker through the work he put into this film.",
977,21 December 2018,sauravjoshi85,10, A true gripping storyline,The movie depicts the atrocities done by Germans very well. Liam neeson plays the character of Oskar Schindler with perfection. Ben Kingsley and Ralph fiennes also match the perfection. A great movie to watch for.,

It moved me and I felt a bit upset at myself for not knowing who Oskar Schindler was before this Movie Liam Neeson plays Schindler and he is Just Excellent, probably his best performance and the same as Ben Kingsley just amazing as Itzhak Stern and the actors who played the Schindler Jews are more then just background characters they have there own personalities because they are all based off of real people.",
979,18 March 2006,ianlouisiana,7, Is The Holocaust really a suitable subject for a Hollywood movie?,"Back in the 1950s there was a shop near Brighton station that sold ""Surgical Rubberware"".Behind the murky plate-glass window lurked copies of ""The History of Torture"", ""The Kiss of the Whip"",""L'Erotisme au Cinema"" ""Health and Efficiency"" and,bizarrely ,next to a flyblown handwritten sign promising ""Trusses fitted here"",""The Scourge of the Swastika"". As a young man I could never work out why the clientele ,a cross section of grubby-mackintoshed bottom-feeders of all ages,would want to read what was presumably a serious study of Nazi atrocities written by a peer of the realm.Sadly,after a few years in the Met Police it became abundantly clear to me that a significant number of my fellow citizens had a prurient interest in Nazism and all its appalling consequences.This coincided with the reappearance of Sir Oswald Mosley and his reconstituted British Union of Fascists on the streets of the East End.Fortunately The Met dealt with these persons in a fairly uninhibited way,and one sunny Sunday morning in the summer of 1962,Mosley's rabble took a fearful hiding from a predominantly Jewish crowd in Ridley Road,Dalston,whilst we stood by admiringly.Among the crowd were many men with tattoos on the inside of their wrists:it was my introduction to the survivors of The Holocaust. Later they saw off Colin Jordan,the British Nazis' new Messiah in a bloody battle near Forest Gate station,and for the next ten years,the British Fascist movement went underground.It crawled back into the light,fuelled by ill-informed resentment against immigrant communities, and nowadays is busy at its evil work of setting the poor and vulnerable against the poor and vulnerable.Just when it was beginning to award itself a thin veneer of political respectability Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" was released and stopped it in its tracks. Generations to whom The Holocaust was as historic an event as The Battle of Hastings were confronted with horrific events that had occurred within their grandparents' lifetime. Central to the film is a towering performance from Mr Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler,but it is more than a showcase for virtuoso acting. It's a horrific reminder of a period in recent history when all the vilest parts of man's nature were allowed and even encouraged to flourish in a country less than two hours'flying time from London and don't let anybody kid you it couldn't happen again. However sober it might be I have a problem with ""Schindler's List"" inasmuch as my personal feeling is that The Holocaust is too horrific an event to be reduced to a ""Hollywood Movie"" status no matter how well intentioned.There are several harrowing documentairies on the subject which serve to instruct and inform. Turning it into a Big Time Movie with star names and marketing it as ""Entertainment"" risks rousing the interest of the same sick people who hung around the flyblown Brighton bookshop all those years ago and their appalling descendants.",

If u have not seen this film yet I really envy you because its 3 hours of pure pleasure and excitement. This is kind of movie which makes u think about its problems next hours ,days and even weeks . No matter how materialistic u are , after seeing Shindler's list u realize that money is far not the most important thing in our life and that even one human saved is worth more than any treasure . I thinks its impossible to transmit all brightness of this film by writing or reading review ,so just go and watch this one!",

This movie has passed all time tests and landed as a modern classic of cinema. It plays sublimely the life of Oskar Schindler. Furthermore, it presents the best acting of Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson. The music played by John Williams is without a doubt one of his best compositions. With violins from Iztak Perlman it is an impressive modern composition. The movie last considerably long.

To film it in black and white was sheer genius. This most definitely is Liam Neeson at his best and as many people have said, I find it absolutely hard to believe he did not win an Oscar for best actor. Certain scenes from this film, for instance the liquidization of the Jewish ghettos is hard viewing but completely spell-bounding at the same time. Watching this film for the first time will leave you in many ways; shocked, chocked up, amazed, saddened and hopeful, (I say hopeful because this story proves that people like Schindler did have a heart and not every German or even Nazi during the Second world war was a callous heartless murderer) if not all of the above. This is worth watching 100%, if not, re-watching quite a few times, as it is a compelling, heartfelt story.",

And it worked.Schindler's list is an amazing movie, If you haven't watched it, you really need to.

I can't wait that many people start watching this film because of director Steven Spielberg, but watch it to the end for the sake of the story.

1016,22 June 2014,cartyt01,10, Schindler's List,"Schindler's List is a gripping true story set in Krakow, Poland during the German invasion during World War II involving the persecution of the Jews. The movie is set in a black and white motif except for a few scenes. The different lighting and shadowing with depth shots make this movie as if seeing it in first person. Oskar Schindler played by Liam Neeson, lives in Czechoslovakia and relocates to Poland after Poland was defeated by Germany within two weeks to become wealthy from the war Schindler is a war profiteer Schindler does not know any Germans in Poland to start an industry; however, Schindler knows of an enamel factory there in which to start his business. Upon arrival into Poland, Schindler works his way into the Germans minds and hearts by becoming well known during a dinner out in the town and buying dinner and drinks. Tango music is played as background music for the affect of Schindler and the Germans entwining a partnership to allow Schindler to open a factory. Schindler has his picture taken with the German elitist and his name becomes a city known name among the Germans. Schindler seeks out Stern a Judenrat and former accountant to open the factory making mess kits with a German army contract. Schindler wants to be known for doing something extraordinary and that no one else had done. Schindler begins seeing from afar the liquidation of the Jews in the Ghetto, and casts his eyes on a little girl wearing a red coat. While this child is being overlooked she escapes the lines and hides under a bed. Schindler cries for her suffrage and he begins seeing human faces and the pain the Jews are enduring. Schindler becomes well-known with Goeth a ruthless German played by Ralph Fiennes. Schindler realizes each Jew did hold a life, were a human being and belonged in a family. Schindler is arrested and Goeth speaks on Schindler's behalf and gets him out of jail, Schindler sees the ashes from Jewish bodies burning, the audience hears in the background a Billie Holiday tune, ""God Bless the Child"". As Schindler watches Goeth with his barbaric treatment, Schindler suggests to Goeth the story of an emperor and granting mercy which Goeth used sporadically as he was an ego maniac. With the war coming to an end, Schindler decides to work out a plan to re-locate his factory and buy from Goeth Jews, and creates his list of names of over 1100.",

Some elements of the film are very good, even excellent, but it has issues that are too deep to be overcome, making it an overall mediocre work that certainly doesn't deserve the high praise it has gotten (much of which is because of Spielberg's treatment of the film itself--donating his salary to charity, having the film sent to high schools around the country, etc.).",

Gripping, moving, tear jerking, uplifting, top notch acting, stunning photography, script line in sync with the book, true life ending, OMG. This is the story of Oskar Schindler who kept over 1,000 people alive during the Nazi reign. This is a movie (and book) you must watch (or read) to believe. I generally do not care for ""war"" movies, and although I love splatter films and gory fiction books, I despise real life violence. Having once been a victim of violent crime, I have a relationship with real life horror that I do not like to explore, but the heroism of this story so dramatically overwhelms the real horrors that it is a must see for anyone. Liam Neeson is phenomenal in his role as Schindler, and Ben Kingsley along with Ralph Finnes fills out the superb acting. Difficult to watch, impossible to forget, it is truly the story of heroism on its grandest scale. The most poignant moment is the one, the only, faded splash of faint color in the little girls red coat; the rest of the movie is black and white, which only adds to the impact of the total emotion of this fantastic film.",

For example, the at the end of the movie...Shindler left with a whole lot of money, which he could probably have used to save even more people, but elected not to.

1044,22 October 2007,Dr_Coulardeau,9, How could Jews be that submissive?,"This film was and still is a revolution in our approach of the Shoah, the Holocaust, the extermination of the Jews during the second world war. It reveals in shocking images the tactics used by the Nazis to capture the Jews, here in Poland, in order to seize their possessions and to transform them into slaves. In each city of some importance all the Jews of a region were compelled to regroup and live entirely within the militarily controlled limits of a ghetto. Then the Nazi Party imposed the election or appointing of a Jewish Council to manage the ghetto, that is to say to implement the orders from the Nazis. Then some businessmen, essentially industrialists came to provide the Jews with work and there the Jews became consenting even if forced slaves and later on the ghettos will be liquidated and forced labor camps will further transform the Jews into inmates forced to work for the businessman and kept in order by some SS unit. The value of the film comes from the fact that the industrialist concerned in Krakow, Schindler himself, comes from previously independent Czechoslovakia and is a member of the Nazi party with important connections in Berlin that gives him the upper hand even on the SS. It is unluckily slightly difficult to believe it since the connections are not brought within our knowledge. Who could in Nazi Germany be more powerful than the SS? The film will show how much money this man was able to make with that slave labor. Real fortunes that enabled him to double his political influence with financial corruption. But there it shows how the Jews from the very beginning (the order to go and live in the closest ghettos) right to the very end (either their being sent to Auschwitz to be gassed or being saved and freed by Schindler) will always disbelieve the worst news they could get and always believe in some kind of higher order that will either sacrifice them or save them, that order being from another dimension of time and space. Is it divine, is it a God, is it some kind of cosmic force? No one knows which one, but it is a force against which you cannot do anything. You have to submit and survive if it so pleases this force. This submissiveness is never questioned and hardly contrasted to some Jewish individuals, and only individuals, who would have thought of resisting, or at least escaping. No matter what happens, they sing a song of lamentation or a song of thanks, but they were reduced to a herd of cattle and they submitted to that fate. It is pathetic to see how Schindler's Jews do not protest against any violence or whatever. They just, on arriving in Auschwitz, call the name of their ""Nazi Master"", Schindler himself. They have been reduced to being Schindler's herd. The vision is absolutely disquieting, disturbing, sickening. That definitely is the worst part of such a war. And that absolute alienation is constantly brought back by any war, be it in Palestine, in Lebanon or in Iraq. That's were the film is poignant and at the same time finds its limit. The film avoids all other types of exterminated group, ethnic or not, because all these other groups produced another attitude: rebellion, refusal, fight, struggle. It is also important to see that even in Poland, even in these ghettos, even within these Jewish Councils there was some refusal, rebellion, even a rebellion in the name of freedom in spite of it meaning immediate death: better die than submit to the final degradation, alienation, internalized victimization. Stephen Spielberg hence does not reflect the whole historical truth but favors one approach only. That explains why the film feels as having aged with time and the end definitely becomes morbidly sentimental: love and gratefulness for the one who made them slaves and only saved them because they were his property that he bought with the money they produced. He is only saving his own possessions, like a rancher would protect his herd. The ending thus is too positive to be acceptable. If the Jews had been able to massively move into rebellion, resistance, guerrilla warfare or even plain warfare, the war could have been different. We are speaking of more than two million Jews just in Poland. To run down such a human wall you need time and quite a lot of tanks and planes. Hence it does not bring in any profit but cost a tremendous amount of money. Could Hitler have afforded it without having to cut some further actions short? A beautiful black and white film but that only shows one side of the picture.",

While the film begins with an amusing and charming twist, Spielberg draws you into the reality of the events in a way that truly brings them to life. He strategically bases the film from the point of view of a man living a life of comfort and safety, not unlike that which we as Americans live and take for granted every day, and showing us the horror of the Jews' lives therein. To the point and yet very fluent, this film is sure to bring a tear to your eye, if it is given your full attention.

1049,24 February 2008,hazrry,10, Schindler's list review,"A masterpiece. That is how I would describe Schindler's List in a few words. Schindler's List is based on the real life story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson). Of course when we think of a film based on a real life we usually think that it is just a ploy to gain people's attention, but this film really does bring real events back to us such as the horrors of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz and the how people like Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) would indiscriminately kill men, women and children just because they are Jews. Steven Spielberg came at this film with the right respect and didn't even receive a salary to direct citing that it would be 'blood money'. He choose to make it as realistic as possible not leaving out a single crying child, a single drop of blood or a single horror anywhere. Many parts of this film are difficult to watch, but if they weren't then this film wouldn't be a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong though, this is not an action film but more of a thriller. To say that the music 'fits' into this film would be a crime. John Williams's scores don't fit the film but make the film. If you wanted to get an Oscar in a film you had made then all you would have to do is get Williams to do the music for you, it wouldn't matter how bad the film was his music would make it come to life. Also there is a mix of both diegetic and non-diegetic music like when the Krakow ghetto is being liquidated a sad monotonous Jewish song is being sang by children which is clearly non-diegetic as no singing could take place in the confusion and death of the ghetto and also shows what a horror the Nazis were committing. The music then stops for a while as the Nazis wait for the Jews in hiding to come out and as the shooting starts a piece of diegetic music also starts which is in total contradiction to what is happening as it is jolly and 'bouncy'. The piece of music is by Beethoven and is being played by a German soldier trying to escape the real world where all the death is happening. The direction is genius to say the least. This film shows just how good Spielberg can be when he wants to be. It creates a very dark subtle humour which messes with your emotions. Such as, going back to the liquidation scene, when the Nazis soldiers are searching for hidden Jews and they shine a light round the room and it reveals a cluster of them and they all raise their hands which brings a smile to your mouth until you realise in horror that those Jews would die and you had found it funny. He also builds expectations that make you think one thing is going to happen and then he makes another thing happen instead. An example of this is the day when Goeth tries to take Schindler's advice on power is when you have every right to kill but don't. The first thing that happens is that Goeth saddle is on the floor and you expect him to shot the guy looking after the horse but he doesn't. After he comes back from horse riding, the Jew who is supposed to be cleaning his bath reports that it couldn't be cleaned. Now you think he won't kill him because he's on a good day and at first the film goes along with that but then as the Jew is walking away a bullet hits the ground at his feet. This makes you think that he is going to kill him but then he misses again and you think he is just playing with him changing your emotions again, and the final bullet hits him in the back of the head killing him instantly. Fiennes plays Goeth beautifully here and in the rest of the film but in this particular scene he makes the warped personality come out extremely well in because Goeth had no reason to kill the Jew and had just 'pardoned' him and yet after he touches the mirror and his nail gets chipped which makes him kill the Jew. Spielberg also gets an excellent performance out of Liam Neeson portraying him as the bad guy in the beginning before bringing in Goeth who is a character so bad he makes anyone look good. This is Neeson's greatest performance by far. Spielberg also uses the popular genre of Neeson's characters as a mentor to great effect getting him to comfort the Jews with opaque realism and develop his own character into someone we can emphasize with and makes us think what we would do in the same situation. The script is an amazing piece of work. The plot doesn't lose a single second of interest in it's over 3 hour running time. This is a feat in itself but then it doesn't just keep your interest but holds itself in your memory forever. Whenever you see that it is being shown on TV you plan to watch it days before it's on and then make sure nothing will interrupt you in that entire time. Each time you watch it you find something you didn't notice before and you can never watch it to many times. The script paints the background of the Victoria Falls in a master piece and leaves the foreground for Spielberg to paint the butterfly. Perfection is not something that easily comes to humans and is something only really found in the night's sky, the largest rainforests and the deepest oceans. It eludes us like a frightened cat and speeds past us like a rocket. This film has not achieved perfection but as the spice train past by it grabbed a handful of perfect and is seasoned all over with it.",

Spielberg is directing from the heart here and delivers his most accomplished film. Schindlers List is punctuated by exceptional performances all round from an ensemble cast including career best performances from Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes.

The film presents the true story of the enigmatic Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party, a womanizer and a profiteer, but who manages to save the lives of more than 1100 Hebrew during the holocaust. The film is a moving testimony about the horrors of war and the human character corruption in wartime. War is the hub around which action and plot, representing a way of salvation for some and condemnation for others. It is a very impressive and emotional film, perhaps the best ever made by Spielberg! Most shocking scene is the last in which Schindler appears to regret not saving more lives and can even use his last money after giving all his wealth to buy the Hebrew and bribe officials to Nazis, I thought that this scene captures the essential best movie and think everyone should see it, even for trauma and suffering caused all product usage options Jews of that period!",

1055,16 July 2008,hayden65,9, Schindler's List is a Masterpiece,"I first saw Schindler's list in my R.Studies class but since it runs for 195 minutes or round abouts, and my R.Studies classes only went on for 60 minutes, i could not watch the whole film but within the first 60 minutes you see the main character of the film, Oskar Schindler, a real man who actually did most of the things as depicted in this film. So after about 2 years of first seeing the film my brother purchased the DVD Schindler's List, the first day he had it and watched it. From the start you see a seemingly greedy and uncaring business man who cares only for money, he is also a member of the Nazi Party, the infamous political party ruling Germany at that time led by none other than Adolf Hitler. Nazi Ideolgy stressed the greatness of the German people and race, they hated peoples such as Jews, Slavs, Roma and homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, the mentally or physically disabled, communists, liberals, and social democrats along with other ethnicities. So from the the moment you know Schindler is a Nazi the general reaction is that he is an unlikeable characters and and through common perception of Nazi-ism, a cruel man. But his character shows not much of the sort, in the scene where he is dancing, laughing and drinking with friends you see him to be a joyous and fun man. throughout the film Oskar Schindlers character steadily changes from the greedy, uncaring Nazi businessman to the selfless humanitarian who, in fact, lost everything to save his Jewish workers ( now known as Schindlers Jews ).",

It was an intense passion project of director steven spielberg. Based on true, horrible, horrible events in poland from WWII, we are taken through one man's journey from being a wartime profiteer to that of a compassionate saviour, rescuing many Jews from peril. Shot in glorious black and white film by dop janusz kaminski, the film tonality acts as a truthful portal into the brutal times of German nazi occupation and the goings on in the horrific work and death camps this is a film that proved that spielberg was and is a true masterful artist and auteur. The arthouse editing tells the story on a thread that also contains small bits of humor. ( One of the best scenes in the film and in perhaps modern cinema is the intro to character amon goethe). The violence is so brutal that you can subconsciously see red in the almost black blood. The 4k transfer, supervised by spielberg, is crisp, modern yet retains a theatrical film screening look and feel.",

And Liam Neeson proves his worth with this movie. The different incidents of torturing the Jews and the change of Oscar Schindler from a greedy, profit-seeking businessman to a kind person in due course of time is what's shown in this movie. And specially the last part of the movie, when Oscar is given the letter and then the ring and then Itzhak Stern says ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"" can make anyone have an outburst of tears. The whole movie, though a bit lengthy, proves more than worth watching. Just one of the very best movies ever made and will be seen and loved by true movie lovers in the future days to come.",

Schindler himself was a part of the Nazi party, and he had been given a factory to produce military clothes, cooking items, and more. He didn't know how to run the factory, and received help from Izakh Stern (leader of a Jewish council), suggesting that he should hire the Jews over the Polish, because they are cheaper. Schindler follows Stern's advice, creating false documents, so he could have ""enough"" Jewish workers.

1066,2 May 2009,studproquo,10," Powerful, dark, and beautiful mixed in a pool of madness and hope.","Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite directors. His films are passionate, have adventure, style, and all of his films have a gifted story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. For example, films such as - Jaws, Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, Close Encounters of the Third Kind - they are all classics and everyone has just about seen them. And with such talents as his, Schindler's List is now my favorite movie. With so many graphic scenes and so much horror, Schindler's List moves you unlike any other film you have ever seen. For example, the scene where the kids think they are going somewhere fun, only to be walking to their deaths, scenes like that move you, and they are all throughout the film. It's visually stunning as in terms of the Holocaust and is one movie everyone must see to understand the true horrific nature of the Holocaust. The movie does not show Adolf Hitler one time, which kind of surprised me, but it does follow an unwealthy business man, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who asks Jews to work for him during the depression in Germany. He treats them nice, because he does not know what is actually happening to the Jews. Once he sees numerous murders with his girlfriend on horseback, he hates the idea of it, but he claims there is nothing he can do. When he is convinced and he hears the ""worst"" cases of what happens to Jews that are in Concentration Camps, he makes it his mission to make a list and have them all work for him, so he can at least save some people. This movie is truly touching, including the scene where the kids are waving bye on the bus, and of course the shower scene where you think they are all going to die, that really surprised me and I nearly cried when they were about to die and then the showers turned on, and they realized where they really were. This movie is truly amazing, and it did win best picture for the Academy Awards, which I am pleased with. I am so satisfied with Spielberg's hard work with this film and his other successful films.

The performances by the lead actors which include Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are top notch and as ever the directing by Steven Spielberg is wonderful. This has to be one of the best films Spielbreg has directed (and he has directed quite a few decent ones). What I thought worked very well on this film was using black and white. When Neeson's character was watching the little girl in the red dress (which was in colour), you could really tell that that was what he was focusing on. Now I'm not one who normally breaks down when watching a movie but I was close when watching this. The horror and cruelty that those Jews had to undertake was unbelievable.

1084,3 January 2007,mnpollio,8, Just misses being a masterpiece thanks to sledgehammer climax,"Schindler's List is one of Steven Spielberg's first ""serious"" Oscar-bait attempts and it is a superb (near flawless) piece of film-making up to a point. Spielberg has chosen to relate the horrors of the Holocaust through the biographical story of businessman Oskar Schindler. Schindler was an opportunist who decided to exploit the Jews affected by Hitler's final solution and utilize them in his factory. As he witnessed first-hand the repercussions of the Holocaust, he gradually began to take active efforts to save the 1100 Jews in his employ by literally buying their lives. Spielberg's stark black-and-white photography enhances the realism of the film and he directs the material with a refreshing no-frills approach. Spielberg is usually known to be a very sentimental director and what is astonishing about his work for much of the film is how cool and unsentimental it is. This is not an insult, the approach works wonders. He let's the tension and the terror of what unfolds speak for itself without embellishing with tired Hollywood clich√©s and intrusions. Liam Neeson's performance as Schindler is nuanced, enigmatic and entrancing. He is a person that one never truly gets to know, but his evolution from unconcerned businessman to one who in a sweaty frenzy tries to beat the clock to remember all of the names of his employees in order to save their lives is amazing acting. Spielberg and Neeson never try to turn Schindler into a saint and we get a warts-and-all central character. Ralph Fiennes is also astounding as the thoroughly amoral Amon Goeth and Ben Kingsley contributes one of his finest restrained performances as foreman Itzhak Stern. I also found Embeth Davidtz moving in the peripheral role of Helen Hirsch, a young Jewish woman who becomes the beleaguered object of affection for both Goeth and Schindler. The film is required viewing for anyone interested in history, the Holocaust or simply masterful film-making. In fact, the only thing that prevents me from ranking the film at its highest level is its conclusion. Spielberg in his latter years seems to have a problem with providing satisfying codas to his films ¬ñ the more serious ones provide the greater difficulties. Schindler's List is no exception and I believe that he panders in the final few moments and fails to accept the intelligence of his audience for processing what went before. He has just crafted a perfect account of the events and torn our hearts out in the process ¬ñ viewers are fully able to comprehend the depth of the accomplishments of Schindler. However, Spielberg seems to feel we need a refresher course. He adds a totally unneeded closing where the real surviving Schindler Jews and their offspring march side-by-side across the screen (all the better to marvel over their numbers) and pay tribute at Schindler's grave. While I must say I was mildly interested in seeing the modern-day equivalents of some of the characters I had just seen on screen, it was like a subtle, insightful film suddenly brandishing a sledgehammer and adopting a totally different approach to make its point. Still, just in case any is still slow on Schindler's accomplishments as a savior, Spielberg then literally types it out for us to remind us exactly how many were saved and how many offspring from future generations have been saved by Schindler's selfless efforts. I really found this drawn-out and needless climax to shatter the mood generated by the earlier portions of the film and it prevents me from rating this a masterpiece.",

1095,6 April 2003,MJCACC9166,9, The Importance of this Special Film In Relation to History,"I would like to make my feelings known for the first time ever on the internet about one of my favorite films.  I do not think that Schindler's List is the greatest film of all time (although I am absolutely delighted that it is rated at #4 on the IMDb list and was #9 on the AFI list of the greatest films ever in the last century) but it is certainly one of the top three greatest war films of all time.  It was more than poetic justice that Steven Spielberg was finally vindicated when he was named as the Best Director of 1993 and this film the very best of that year.  What made it special for me personally (since I am an Anglophile) was that the top four acting roles went to Brits: Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler; Ralph Fiennes as Goeth; Ben Kingsley as Stern; and Caroline Goodall as Emilie Schindler. The fact that it was filmed in black and white with stunningly effective cinematography enhanced the film's uniqueness although it was obviously an Oscar bid by Spielberg, who had agonized over whether to have the project helmed by Roman Polanski before he himself took on the burden.  (How ironic that only recently Polanski was justly honored for his great work for directing The Pianist, which I think is the best film since Titanic).  I can understand why there is a continual debate about the significance of this film, but it cannot be denied that it is a necessary work of art and a very valuable history lesson, particularly now that we are once again a nation at war with anti-Semitic totalitarianism.  I support anyone's right to free speech, but I am truly appalled that many Americans want to deny that there was even a Holocaust, or wish to forget what happened in the past, and find personal satisfaction in condemning this movie as overrated or mere Jewish propaganda to downplay any other horrific crimes committed by other nations in times of war throughout history.  I was not at all surprised when Titanic became such a huge hit (the biggest in fact since Gone With The Wind) that even schoolchildren began doing book reports on the subject and the entire movie-going planet seemed to erupt in Titanicmania.  Common sense will tell anyone willing to take the time to think about it that the Holocaust was the Titanic at least five thousand times over, and to be honest, I would rather drown in freezing ocean water two miles deep in the dead of night than face death in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. I still think it was ridiculous that James Cameron asked for a moment of silence for the victims of history's most celebrated shipwreck at the end of his Oscar acceptance speech, when Steven Spielberg merely (and politely) asked that the nation's schoolteachers ""please teach this in your schools"" when he was so honored for making a film about the most ghastly crimes of the millennium.  There is a huge difference between escapist entertainment and serious enlightenment when it comes to movie making.  Just ask Steven Spielberg, who has also directed some of the biggest blockbusters ever made. His heart's desire is clearly the driving force behind all of his films; Schindler's List most of all.",

It certainly was not easy to play this psychopath. I also like the fact that this movie crosses out, that they were also ""good"" Germans during the Nazi time. All what Oskar Schindler did at the very beginning was for his very own benefit. So it is quite amazing how he turned to be such a caring and helpful person. And the part of Itzhak Stern is also just great! First he played along with Schindler's plan because this brought him to the position to help his fellow people. He did not like Schindler at all, he even refused to have a drink with him. But step by step he realized how Schindler's character really was. And near the end, when Schindler offered to have a drink with him at the end of the war, he preferred to have one straight away. In my opinion watching this movie is just a MUST!!",

I was therefore not affected by the usual ""Speilberg masterpiece"" hyperbole that seemed to attach itself to any review. Subsequent viewings have however confirmed that this is in fact a Masterpiece in the truest sense of the word.Take out the ""quirky"" black & white photography, which I actually found to be a bit of a wank, (the jews and nazis experienced this all in real colour not in mono in a sterile cinema), the feel and strength of the photography made me weep... I was there, I was a victim. That probably sounds very pretentious from a white, middle class, Catholic Australian, but if a movie can move me the way this did, it must have something going for it. I have seen this movie 4 times now and although the shock value has been diminished somewhat, the message remains... ignorance is deadly!

It won loads of awards, including seven Academy Awards. Despite the fact that it is not quite an epic with its relatively low budget, it justifies its existence with great acting, directing, a very well-written script, rich characters, and authenticity that no other film has yet equalled. But unfortunately, it is marred with a slow pace, some pointless scenes, extremely unnecessary sex scenes and nudity and the lack of any real originality in the acting. No acting awards were won, but the most memorable performance was hammered home by Ralph Fiennes, who played Amon Goeth. His real villainy and spite made the film even colder. This film not only hammered home the true horrors of Nazi regime, it also shows that there are good people in even the most villainous clans, and those good people end up being remembered for what they did.",

Spielberg took a huge step in turning the events of Schindler and the Jews he put on his list to work for him that would ultimately be saved by him. Spielberg executes this very sensitive topic by putting so much emotion in it. The first time I watched this movie was in my junior year in high school in American History class and throughout the movie it was amazing to see the different expressions of shock, stunned, and tears in the eyes of even high schoolers. The movie, although very long, keeps your attention. Spielberg also does a great job with adding in small figures and things to make you stop and think what they mean and how it relates to everything, including the color red that shows up very little, but shows a symbol of color within a black and white movie.",
1110,26 July 2020,BadgerStorm4345,10, The Least Enjoyable Masterpiece of All Time,"Schindler's List has a narrative that centers around the Holocaust and Oskar Schindler's story. This Movie is more haunting than any slasher horror movie for many reasons. For one, the music is somber and builds up utter hopelessness or dread, depending on what fits the scene. The Second reason is that this has a real world basis and there are millions of people who actually died in our world, only a fraction of the horror can be shown through a movie, but there's no film that does it better. The third reason is that there is nothing special about the villains of this movie, they were real people with no special gifts, they just had their rage controlled by a Mad Man who directed their rage to kill millions of people through war and genocide. The Nazis are normal people, which fills you with much more dread than anything else.

1116,25 November 2018,FilmLiquet,9, Film Liquet on Schindler's List,"Let me start off by saying that Schindler's List is a very heavy film to watch. It is not meant for everyone and not every member of the audience will able to appreciate it. The gut-wrenching, horrifying scenes that represent the real events happening during the Second World War in Krakow, Poland, are hard to watch. The film being three hours long, tests your patience and ability to put up with the inhumane events on screen.
The film is about a businessman Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), who arrives in Krakow in 1930, ready to make his fortune from the new World War. After joining the Nazi party for political immunity, he re-opens an old factory, using Jewish workers, as they are cheaper than any other person at the time. When the SS begins exterminating Jewish people in the ghetto, Schindler tries to save his workers, in order to protect the operation of his factory and what starts as a selfish reason becomes a noble cause to save innocent lives.
The film is in black and white, however the opening sequence for some reason is in colour. The film's events are very realistically shown, up to the point where it becomes infuriating and sickening to watch the tragedy unfold. The human emotion portrayed by the actors is too believable, it physically brings you to the place of the events and shows us the horror that the Jewish people experienced during the horrific events. This is the sole focus of the film.",

1121,14 December 2021,Waedliman,7, Could have been better,"You certainly can't say that this is a bad film. It is simply too well crafted for that, most of the actors are excellently cast and Spielberg is too clever a fox to miss the chance to present a hot Oscar contender here in overlength, to get away from the image of the eternal big kid and to present a serious topic in an appropriately serious manner. First of all, I don't ask myself who this Oskar Schindler really was, because a film is a film and not a documentary. For me, Liam Neeson doesn't really manage to give this character more than one or two dimensions, his closing monologue is almost embarrassing and unpleasant, because next to such greats as Ralph Fiennes or Ben Kingsley, who both do an excellent job here, Neeson takes a bath. Why was he cast is the first question I asked myself in the first hour of the film. The second question came right after that and was confirmed throughout the film. Why is the world so consistently and at the same time superficially divided into two camps in ""Schindler's List""? Here the sadistic Germans, portrayed in relentless consistency as maniacs and desperate by Ralph Fiennes, then there the Jews, all lovable people, clearly, without exception. Schindler's List is not a pedagogical film, why doesn't Spielberg allow us to see the dark sides as well as the bright spots on both sides? Schindler is a kind of border crosser, but Neeson is unable to credibly transform the cynical businessman into a philanthropist. Add to that the length of the film, which got on my nerves a bit, because constant headshots and pseudo-documentary long scenes don't give me any more information than that I find the Nazis and their actions completely repugnant anyway. One shot is enough for that, I don't need 100. And the final sequence with a crying Schindler is just embarrassing for me. Nevertheless, I scored 7 full points, because I really can't complain about the craftsmanship here. A tighter and bolder script might have worked wonders.",

If you first heard that a movie going to be shown for World War II , Holocaust , genocide of Jews in Europe, you may not give it a highest priority list for you popular films and that may not attract many of the audience specially the younger generation but Schindler's List and the name Steven Speilberg , who himself , have a great brand value surely will attract a lot of them and the way the film is being made , the way of story telling , will get you into the story and grow an interest within yourself to know more about it , the Holocaust, the Nazi, the German tortures , occupation of Poland, tremendous harsh reality faced by Polish Jews. A 3 hour plus film , but we may not able to get yourself out of the story. Story of an unsuccessful Businessman , Schindler , who moved to Poland for using the War as an opportunity to do business with Nazi Govt. but somehow it turns into a situation where , he used this as a tool to save Jews, who was working for his factory ,was not in the massacre list due to their capability of producing products for German Army. And when Schindler realizes that it can save a Jews life , he start recruiting as much jews as possible to save them from Nazi atrocity. For that he even bribed German Generals and put his life and reputation also in risk on the eye of Nazi Govt. Those 1100 Jews were the survivors at the end of the war. WE can see in the film , when a Soviet Army soilder , met them , the survivors, then the Chief Accountant of Schindler , who was an integral part of his business asked that soldier that if there still any Jews alive in Poland ? That also depicts how important was the work of Schindler was to save those 1100 jews , who can be easily another direct war victim of the Holocaust.
2. A strong German character who was the chief of a military team , also helped us to understand the psychological state of that time German Soldiers and the Jews who worked under them. A maid was working under that general but she was always afraid about what to say, as there is also no set of rules for a Jew to know what to do best them, as the level of their hatred was so deep that a Jew maid also have no answer to any question, no answer was enough to answer the Germans. Their thought blocked , they become victim of immense hatred produced by Nazi Govt. and racism that made them blind. The conversation between the Schindler and that maid depicted clearly that thought differences almost accurately.",

The directing, the acting, the cinematography, the music, and everything puts this film at the top. It's hard to think it was made in 1993, because AFI's top 100 movies, put this at 9. Now important movies, are the ones who broke barriers, and ones other films follow. This was made in the 90's, and it is still that important. Steven Spielberg showed everyone, (including the Oscars) why he is one of the greatest directors of all time. I watch this movie a lot, but not just for the story.

Mr. Spielberg, did a marvelous job, compiling all on screen, with the way that the music would be played out as well. Anyone, who can handle a true account of what happened, should sit down, and pay close attention to the wonderful video, that sums it all up. Although there is the language barier at spots, the video is still simply explaining what happened to all of the innocent; and shows why Schindler was one of the very few Nazi party members, who was willing to put his life on the line, in order to save the lives of those, who Hitler would have killed.",
1133,20 April 1999,bnm81510,8, By no means perfect,"This grandiose opus Spielberg directed to cement his name as a ""serious"" filmmaker, stands in a very dubious position : its very subject is so sacred and untouchable to the civilized world (including film critics), that questioning the film's integrity as of late has been almost equated to denying the Holocaust itself. The truth, however is bitter: ""Schindler's List"" is far from perfect. Spielberg, previously known for his family-oriented, gawking adventure yarns that usually were as far away from tangible reality as possible, indeed has surprised everyone with the heartwrenching brutality of the Jewish victims' suffering, which he vividly depicts. The most powerful scenes in the film work on a purely instinctive level: they're silent and do not involve familiar individuals, they play almost like some perversely voyeuristic yet priceless footage of Nazi atrocities. The wisely chosen, eloquent black and white cinematography is a definite highlight. Everything else, for the most part, has Spielberg at his old game: he was always best at spectacle, and worst at character development. A dozen or so Jews are singled out as ""types"", and are traced throughout the film. In over three hours, we learn absolutely nothing about them, they're merely sheep to be saved by Schindler. The man himself is provided with almost no real explanation for his change from an opportunistic slaveowner to a righteous saint-like figure. In the last ten minutes, he simply steps out of character and lapses into a stagy farewell; seductively tearjerking, but completely out of place in a movie that aspires to an authentic representation of the Holocaust. The only character that even begins to approach three-dimensionality is the local Nazi henchman , (Ralph Fineness), one of the most interesting portrayals of a villain in recent cinema. Despite its considerable problems, ""Schinler's list"" is still widely used to introduce the new, unsophisticated audience to the mid-twentieth century horrors: whether or not is should be, remains open to debate.",

As to what extent can we stretch the viewer's imagination to elicit empathy considering that this is a reboot of a film released ten years earlier.

Although this started off as a religion class movie, it was much more than just that. I feel like that I connected with the movie on more of a spiritual way instead. The most heartbreaking scene to me was the final one, where Oskar Schindler broke down in tears as he was about to flee Germany. I think that the situation he was placed in really exemplified the role of moral issues in the movie. He reflected in his choices he made relating to the number of lives that he could saved and this I'm sure, left Schindler with a tremendous amount of guilt. This was also a point in the movie where I realized the big issue at heart in this movie. The dilemma I think he was facing was one about sacrifice and how much a life is worth. I thought that this idea was one that really challenged the audience and is an unanswerable question. Apart from the emotional/moral side of this movie, I thought it was well produced and well made. The acting from Liam Neeson in this was fantastic and he showed the feelings faced perfectly. I would definitely recommend this movie for anyone - it really shows the state of society during The Holocaust and faces important moral values.",

1169,7 October 2014,ayush-rock04,9, Great Movie,"Schindler's List blends the abject horror of the Holocaust with Steven Spielberg's signature tender humanism to create the director's dramatic masterpiece.Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Thomas Keneally's novel based on the role of Oscar Schindler during the holocaust was very much his cinematic coming of age. Many have criticized Schindler as a profiteer and coward for not taking up arms against the Nazis. He was not a soldier and if he had done, at best he may have killed a handful of inconsequential German troops before dying a ""hero's death"". And every man, woman and child who worked in his factory would have been murdered. Spielberg does not shy away from the fact that he was not a saint, showing him to be a womanizer and hedonistic opportunist but when he was faced with the human tragedy of his environment he acted; a reaction that was all too rare at the time. In fact Spielberg draws parallels between Schindler and Goeth, his counterpart in the military work-camp but whereas the industrialist was a man of compassion, Goeth was the embodiment of the Nazi party; a cold, cruel and ruthless man who acted without conscience or mercy. It's true that the film is guilty of button pushing, but it is the manipulation of a master story teller; the highlighting of the girl in the red coat in particular is obviously Spielberg's way around the old adage of ""one death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic."" Putting a human face on an individual tragedy is the only way it is possible to process horror on such an unimaginable scale. Beautifully shot and expertly played, Schindler's List is a remarkable and moving film that will no doubt be part of a larger monument to an atrocity that must be remembered to ensure that it is never, ever repeated.",

He owed a factory to produce enamelware, and Stern, his Jewish assistant, mainly hired Jews as they cost less.

This is shown when they are forced to leave their homes in the beginning of the movie, only allowed to take what they can carry, and leave all other belongings. Some men are seen praying or holding prayer beads. As they are gathered on the street, there is many anti-Jewish graffiti seen on the walls and windows of shops and so on. They are then moved to the Ghetto, where they are forced to work and kept inside the community. They still prayed to God that things would be just again, and still retained faith. When out of no where, the Nazi authority gathers people on the streets and shoots them if they don't get on a train to a labor camp. Many are seen paying respects to a small shrine in their homes, or praying. Even when they are put in a labor camp, an old lady performs the rituals of a Bar Mitzvah for a boy. Then they leave the labor camp for Schindler's factory, which is where there is peace for them. ",

Either 1 or 10 score. I can't understand it. To me, Schindler's List has both merits and flaws. It is a technically perfect film, for example. I think no director can beat Spielberg on that. He is able to film such an overwhelming, astonishing scene as the Warsaw Ghetto raid and simply...well, simply make you buy it. He can offer you a conventional scene, like that Jewish fugitive trying to deceive his Nazi chasers, and provide you a glimpse of his terror so intense that you can even feel it. No other director that I am aware of is able to take advantage of modern technology in a way even remotely close to Spielberg. No one else has the power to offer us wonders, to leave you speechless, to make the unbelievable believable. He did it in Schindler's List, then in Prince of Egypt, then in Private Ryan (perhaps the most amazing visual experience in my life). Even Munich shrinks your guts in the shooting scenes.",

The film is based around his story, but also includes other occurrences such as ones relating to Amon Girth, concentration camps, extermination camps, gas chambers, ghettos, the War etc. As a student, watching this film helped me to gain more of an understanding of the Holocaust and what happened during that horrible time. It captured a side of the story in a more real way than out of a textbook, it showed me the human side, the emotions and fear that can't be described in words. In a surprising way, I enjoyed watching the film, even though it upset me at points. The Holocaust is an event that no human should ever avoid, and as horrifying as it is, I don't regret watching this real-life tale.

The other reason, is that I personally have an aversion to movies about the holocaust, because it makes me so mad, that every time I see it, whether it's from genuine stock footage, or staged for movie sets, like this one, I feel like barging into the screen like John Rambo, and shooting every brownshirt in sight, which is the same feeling I get when I see TV news footage of the more recent Serbian Holocaust against non-Serbs in the former Yugoslavia.

I would like to focus attention on one of the facets of its semantic component, which for some reason escapes the critics' view, although it does not lose its relevance today - on the contrary, it begins to be especially acutely perceived and play with new colors precisely in our days. It's about how the film stunningly shows how the ""windows of Overton"" gradually opened, leading to the immersion of society in the inferno. The director masterfully depicts this with strokes passing as a background for the main narrative. At first, Jews were obliged to wear armbands with stars and were forbidden to conduct business, engage in certain types of activities. Some time has passed - and they are driven into the ghetto, deprived of their property. And finally, the next step is executions, concentration camps and genocide through gas chambers. History teaches us (and Spielberg's brilliant creation perfectly illustrates this) that any segregation of people on any basis, any infringement of their rights and discrimination (even if they do not look alarmist at first) always ends very badly in the end - full-fledged fascism, concentration camps with barbed wire, friendly dogs and smoky pipes of crematoriums.",

But after seeing the massacre of Jews with the hands of German soldiers, he feels the pain of Jews. And decided to purchase 1,100 Jews and transfer them to his other factory in his home town so that they could all survive until the end of the war. Because of this he becomes broke, but even then he doesn't regret his decision which makes him more divine. This film is great for describing a time when Jews suffered very badly. Some scenes in this film are so heart-wrenching that they will make you cry. A scene is there when all children were being separated by their parents by Germans. Some kids decide to hide so the Germans don't find them. Some hide beneath the wooden floor, some in chimneys and some hide in latrines where human feces are stored.

1202,13 April 2001,moviefan-50,7, Powerfully disturbing film with lack of credibility/unnecessary storyline of Oskar Schindler,"No doubt a powerful and disturbing film about THE MOST tragic time in humanity, and it broke my heart to see all the mistreatment and the carelessness/complete disregard for human life. I can't help wonder, though, if the story is really credible. Why would a German businessman risk his life and undergo bankruptcy to save people that his very people were against? If this story really is true, I doubt he did so out of the kindness of his heart, but more for reputation-boosting. I expected a lot from this film, after all, it outlines something horrifying and truly a tragedy, but I couldn't help thinking that this film undermined the sensitivity of this subject by including a greedy, selfish, profiteering, womanizing German businessman in the story. I think that if you really want to learn more about the Holocaust, it should not be through films such as this, but through actual real-life documentaries that include no ""other"" unnecessary characters/stories, but truly tell the real pain, the real hurt and loss of the Jewish people who were treated so badly just because they believed differently from others. Regardless, there were some truly powerful moments in the film: The pictures of the starving prisoners who were forced to strip and be inspected by Nazi doctors, who would determine whether they could work or whether they should be killed. The little girl in the bright red dress, the only color, the only sunshine, in an otherwise gray, dark period of time, the very essence of innocence, and her symbolism later in the film when her lifeless body is wheelbarrowed over to the ever-growing pile of dead bodies that were to be incinerated. When Amon Goeth's young Jewish maid asks Oskar Schindler why he shot an elderly woman who was just passing by, bothering no one, looking at no one; his reply: because she meant nothing to him, she was just one of those people who neither bothered nor pleased him, just that she was just a random person with no meaning to him, was the reason why he so cruelly took a life so easily.",

I had read a lot about it on Wikipedia and IMDb but nothing could have prepared me for the sheer horror I witnessed on my TV. Schindler's List is not a movie. It's a true, enduring film. I made the mistake of first watching it solely as a film and not for what it truly stood for. Schindler's List is something everyone should witness, because that is all you can be when you watch the film: A witness. Steven Spielberg's brilliance and perseverance gives the world the final truth in film of the Holocaust. The masterpiece creates an epic yet eye-opening view for me into the Holocaust. Spielberg is not present in the film. You cant name one trademark he has on it's finished product. I didn't cry when I watched Schindler's List, but I will go back again soon to cry for the terror and inhumanity Steven Spielberg gave me. Schindler's List is a film everyone should see, but only when you are ready to face the truth, and have it give you a stare straight back. I love this film, and I cant wait to go back to it when I am ready to face the horror of 1939-1945. Steven Spielberg deserves a thank you from the world, for giving us the terror, horror, inhumanity, and final truth of the story of Schindler's List. Watch it when you know you're ready, because even then, the truth will make you doubt if you can press onward through the three hour film. Thank You Steven Spielberg.

1204,18 October 2016,razorclw,10, Fantastic Depiction,"Usually when I see a modern film that is shot entirely in black and white I roll my eyes because the intended effect is usually far from the level of serious that I actually perceive. This is not one of those films. The black and white is perfect for the subject matter and REALLY adds to the story in ways unknown to someone who hasn't seen the film. The amount of hatred and malice displayed in this film puts one in an uncomfortable state that easily shows how serious the subject matter is. Albeit the Holocaust was no laughing matter, however if you are one who knows nothing about the history of WWII, coming into this movie will definitely open your eyes. It was once said that ""When Steven Spielberg first showed John Williams a cut of the film, Williams was so moved he had to take a walk outside for several minutes to collect himself"". I felt exactly the same way. I had plans to get some at-home work done after watching this movie, but was put at a standstill for so long after seeing it that I ended up being 30 minutes behind schedule. This is not a bad thing. If you have not seen this movie, it is an absolute requirement.",

1207,9 May 2016,oOoBarracuda,5, Schindler's List,"Oskar Schindler was a German member of the Nazi party who saved the lives of over one thousand Jews during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. In 1993, Steven Spielberg believed Oskar Schindler's was a story that needed to be told, directing that year's Best Picture Academy Award winning film. Casting Liam Neeson in the titular role with Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes in strong supporting roles, Oskar Schindler's courageous story was brought to life. The story of an unlikely hero proves the point that even the most individual of lives can be turned to a life lived for the masses. ",

This isn't a particularly graphic film in any way, but any minor showcase of violence here is still very well executed, without any close ups or annoying music queues. The violence is captured in a way which isn't gratuitous but still manages to properly present the stakes in the plot, as it knows when it's more effective to show something, and when it's more effective not to show something.",

This movie is very accurate as well: in depicting Schindler's personality and the names and numbers of people saved and so forth. I think everyone should watch this movie for it will make a person re-evaluate things they complain about and things of that matter and those problems may seem really childish compared to what someone can withstand without any complaint at all and with more pain.",
1212,8 November 2005,tevildo,10, I am at a loss for words!,"After finally watching ""Schindler's List"", I can definitely say this - I will never be the same person again. The movie affected me in ways I would never have imagined. It's not about the plot or the extreme graphic violence. It's about the man - Oskar Schindler. As a German and a member of the Nazi party himself, he is a war profiteer who ends up redeeming Jews from the horrors of Holocaust. The transition of the man is one of the greatest beauties I found in the movie. The performances left me open-mouthed as well. Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Finnes were near-perfect in their roles. I was especially struck by the performance of Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, the Jew. In what is one of my favourite scenes, when Schindler dictates his ""list"" to Stern, he looks up at Schindler and says ""This list is life."" How his voice was choked with emotion! I have never seen a more realistic performance. And the final scene where Schindler breaks down saying he could have saved more.. such starkness! Spielberg has, with this movie earned my deepest respect and admiration. There is never a dull moment and the camera work is brilliant. The movie looks splendid in black and white. My fullest admiration for Mr.Spielberg for making this movie.",
1213,17 August 2017,zombiefan89,5, I would have filmed it in color.,"The film has this weird gimmick if colorizing specific things like a little girl's coat or candles. It really wasn't used enough to warrant the gimmick. To my knowledge, no actual World War II footage was used during the film. If they had done that, I could understand filming the movie in black and white. There was a small scene that was shot for shot copied from Citizen Kane for some reason. Another odd thing, Hitler was never mentioned in the film. I would have expected at least some mention of him. I don't count that against the film though. As for the story, it jumps around a lot at first. It's just several nameless people being killed by nameless Nazi soldiers. It's horrific violence, which I guess was the point.

Obviously, certain events that happened in reality were not included, and some of the things that happened in the movie did not happen in reality. One of the things that I didn't like about the movie was how everything was black and white, and there was only color for a few seconds in the beginning and end. Also, throughout the movie, it was hard to pickup what the actors were trying to say. Overall, I really did enjoy this movie, it presented the historical facts really well.",
1218,31 January 2006,chtfj21,5, Too cheesy for a film as serious as this one.,"I suppose this is an ""important"" film, and it deserves some merit for educating simple folk about the Holocaust. But as a film it's rather mediocre. Schindler's List would have ended up as just another war film among thousands had it been set in a Russian, rather than a German concentration camp. This is a sensitive topic and I didn't like the degree of sensationalism used by Spielberg, as if this were a purely commercial Drama. Most of the characters are stereotypes, which fulfils a purpose I guess, as it depicts the Nazis as unambiguously evil, but it doesn't add to the quality of the film. The plot was predictable and, just like in most Spielberg films, a little bit too ""clean"" and not gruesomely random enough. The scene with the bare chested Nazi shooting people from his balcony was distasteful in my opinion, and I would have been more moved and ""shocked"" (as was no doubt intended) had this repugnant Nazi character been depicted in a more life-like way and as less of a caricature. The graphic scenes of women screaming in the showers were unnecessary. Often the true horror of an atrocity can be conveyed by omitting certain parts, and I don't think Spielberg got it right.",

However, this film drags on pretty slow and in the end I ultimately felt nothing. That's not to say this film doesn't have moments that are absolutely gut wrenching, disturbing, and haunting. But, as a whole, this movie didn't have as much an impact as I thought. Also, I could have done without the black and white film gimmick. Like why? Oh! I know why. Because this is a serious motion picture and Spielberg has to convey that in his infantile way. Great film score, even though it's depressing as hell to hear. All in all, worth the watch once.",

I will start from the dialogs. This movie had long dialogs. I've seen movies with long dialogs which I've enjoyed every sentence of it, but the dialogs of this film were just plain boring! Even IF we accept that the dialogs were meaningful, this doesn't cover the serious lack of enthusiasm in the dialogs!!! no excitement whatsoever in their speeches!!! This movie failed to make me care what was gonna happen next. And finally, though it may be appealing to some, I can't come to finding any interest in the Idea of making a black and white movie in the 90s!! I know many people may disagree with what I said, but with the reasons I have given, I believe it's not unwise that I expect at least a fraction of the crowd to agree with me; therefore it's just unbelievable seeing an average of 8.9!!!",

In my opinion, money is not everything for a person. Money brings a lot of troubles and troubles. It is a kind of disgusting but indispensable thing in our life. The very existence of schindler gives me a sense of relief about the world and a slight sense of hope. In fact, everyone can become schindler.
