0,15 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10, So good in so many ways,"I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/
1,1 June 2000,Anonymous_Maxine,10, How could anything be more fun than this?,"Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.",r
2,28 November 2004,mm-39,10, Great movie,"One of the last movies I went with sister to see back in 86. The film blew my mind. My friends never wanted to see this one. I was happy I went. Many year's latter, I bought ""Back to the Future"" at Mc Donalds for $2.99 or for some other low price with a meal. The film ages well, and I love it just the same. The director and screen writer mixes science fiction, humor, and action perfectly. A big component of the script is time line theory which drives the story. Marty has many problems to fix, and finds out more than anyone wants to know about their parents. Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd were excellently casted. Marty and Doc what a chemistry. With the film series one see the many dualities with time travel, that become a constant with the movie. The town clock, being awoke in a strange place, and letters. Keep this in mind when watching the 2 other sequels. The theory that time repeats itself is evident. What a time machine, the Delorian adds to this movie. Worth watch over again. 10 out of 10! Thank you TBS for showing all 3 films.",e
3,17 April 2017,ivo-cobra8,10, A classic masterpiece the original the only best my favorite time travel film of all time,"What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! ",v
4,9 May 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, An '80s classic that never disappoints,"I admit to having grown up on 1980s films and thus having a special admiration for them. Whichever way you look at it, BACK TO THE FUTURE is one of the most intelligent of the Hollywood blockbusters from that era, a film which perfectly merges crowd-pleasing entertainment with a complex and well-written storyline that gets to grips with the thorny subject of time travel.",i

7,20 November 2010,BA_Harrison,10, A film you can watch time and time again.,"My DVD of Back To The Future is like my own personal time machine: I hit play on the remote and I'm instantly whisked back to 1985, when hair was big, fashion was fugly, films were fun and I was a mere 17 years of age with my whole adult life ahead of me.",/
8,21 July 2015,hannahsutcliffe,10, Absolute Classic,"As a child, I used to watch this movie religiously. I loved the chemistry between Doc Brown and Marty McFly, I loved the all too familiar soundtrack and the ridiculous way in which George McFly laughs. This movie has become such a nostalgic and feel-good film for me. I had the good fortunate to see all three 'Back to the Future' movies in cinema last year and it was such an experience to watch this timeless classic with people who enjoy this film as much as I do. Everyone has to see this film at least once in their life! Such an amazing, funny Sci-Fi from the 1980's. I just can't get enough of this movie - it will just never get old. Cannot recommend it enough!",r
9,1 December 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, Part 1-Goodness gracious! Great balls of fire!,"I just asked my friend that I'm speaking with through instant messenger if he had ever seen ""Back to the Future"" and he said ""Yeah, who hasn't?"", sadly, I never had the opportunity until tonite and he called me a failure as a movie buff, well, at least I've seen the movies now! Ha ha! I'm back on track! Well, obviously, this is my first review for the first Back to the Future and when I came her to IMDb, I knew this was a well loved movie, I was just amazed at it being on the top 250, but I can't give it a lower rating because Back to the Future was an excellent film that was ground breaking for it's time and still today.",w

11,3 July 2003,Angry_Arguer,10, The Lost Blockbuster,"Back to the Future is one of those rare, almost forgotten, pieces of pop culture that, surprisingly, draws little attention to itself.  Unlike such notable gimmicks as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jaws, and Independence Day, there aren't any low-budget leeches trying to imitate off this work and cash-in on its success. This is due to the near flawless script.  Why it didn't win an Oscar, you're guess is as good as mine.  Making a time-travel storyline as in this movie that doesn't fall into plot holes the size of Terminator's is exceptionally difficult.  I'd know.",2
12,21 July 2014,ironhorse_iv,9, Great Scott! Back to the Future is a great time-travel movie!,"Synchronize your watches! If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88mph, you're gonna see some serious s***. Directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, this movie will forever remind me of what good-feel movie is supposed to be. The movie is about a teenager from 1985, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) whom is sent back in time to 1955. While, he was there, he meets his future parents in high school and accidentally becomes his mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson)'s romantic interest, causing a time-rip. Marty must repair the damage to history by trying to get his parents to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd), while, also finding a way to return to 1985. I love the fish out of water history time-travel comedy, with the high-stakes action scenes. It was very entertaining. I love how the film has its running gags, and inside jokes of historical pop culture events; of Robert Zemeckis's work, and what was happening in the 1980s at the time. The movie has everything for every audience member, at the time. While, most movies were risqué and adult-aimed at the time; this movie balance it, enough to make it watchable for both family and single house-hold settlings. Parents went to go see it for nostalgia reasons. While the movie is mostly set in 1950's, it's truly a mark of the 1980's. I have to give the movie props with its controversial movie dilemma, with the Oedipal relationship with his mother. In any other movie, this might be tasteless, and turn people off, but Back to the Future made it work. I can also buy that, teenager Marty McFly would be friends with an older mad scientist, Doc Brown without it being creepy. Both have this father/son relationship that I love from this film. Mad praise to Christopher Lloyd for creating this character for his own. I can't see, anybody besides him. The production was indeed challenging. There were some changes that help the film, a lot. First off, is the title of the film, the film was almost call, 'Spaceman from Pluto'. Gladly, somebody came to their senses, and went back into the title, 'Back to the Future'. Another is that, while, Michael J. Fox was the first choice to play Marty McFly, but he was committed to the show Family Ties. So they hired Eric Stoltz. I wouldn't say, Eric Stoltz would be awful in the movie, but indeed, Michael J Fox was the best choice for the film and they wait on production, until Fox's schedule opened up. The supporting cast is well-acted. Crispin Glover that played George McFly got all George's nerdy mannerisms, right. Lea Thompson is just amazing, and beautiful actress to play Lorraine McFly. Thomas F. Wilson as the bully, Biff Tannen was just hilarious. Every scene with him, made the film, so much better. You'll love to hate him. The set use for the film is one of the most famous movie backlot, previously being used in such works as 1962's To Kill a Mocking Bird, 1960's Inherit the Wind, and others works. The movie had a pretty good pace. There weren't a lot of slow or boring moments. Maybe, the beginning, it does take them, forever to get the time travel part of the film. Eight minutes were cut, including Marty watching his mom cheat during an exam, George getting stuck in a telephone booth and Marty pretending to be Darth Vader. Thank God, they cut the 'Nuking the Fridge' idea. An early draft of the Back to the Future script saw Marty travelling through time in a fridge and being caught in a nuclear bomb detonation. Spielberg would later use this in 2008's Indiana Jones & Kingdom Skull. Zemeckis almost cut out the ""Johnny B. Goode"" sequence as he felt it did not advance the story, but the preview audience loved it, so it was kept. The visual/special effects are just ground-breaking for the time, and it's just beautiful to watch. The opening scene, flawlessly sets up the film's central themes of time and space, provides heaps of exposition. The music by Alan Silvestri is emotional, epic and intense music. It's give the feel of two friends alone, fighting alone against two of the greatest forces ever know to humanity; time and fate. About Huey Lewis and the News, ""The Power of Love"". It's a product of its time. It doesn't hurt or help the film. It's just there. I do love the 'Earth Angel' song. It's romantic as hell. There are some nitpicks that I could focus on, like the time-travel plot-holes, but trying to understand the logic of all the time travel paradoxes, would take you out of the movie, and give you a headache. It's not worth it. Still, how his parents never find out that Marty McFly look like the kid, Calvin Klein from their childhood? Other faults of the movie are, the Pepsi product placement and its over used clichés. The movie also one of those films that would audience would see anything in it, as people see symbolism from 9/11 tragedy, JFK assassination conspiracy, Aliens, and others. Others see the film, themes taken from ancient and spiritual myths such as Kronos vs Zeus, the Bible, and others. One thing, it did influence is the skateboarding culture. The movie occurred during the 1980s infancy of the skateboarding sub-culture. The film was such a success, that it create two sequels, 1989's 'Back to the Future Parts II' and 1990's 'Back to the Future Park III'. It also create an animated series, theme park ride, several video games and a forthcoming musical. As with all great movies, Back to the Future, has stood the test of time. It never gets old. Overall: Power up the DeLorean, turn the time circuits on and get the flux capacitor! Where we're going, we don't need roads.",1
13,30 November 2015,onetrickpony-97192,10, 1.21 giga watts of awesomeness,"This is without a doubt, my favorite movie of all time. Back to the future stars': Micheal.J.Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Crispin lover just to name a few.

14,16 September 2001,SmileysWorld,10, As close as you can get to a perfect movie,"I feel that there is no such thing as a perfect film,but in today's cinema,""Back to the Future"" comes amazingly close.It has laughs, AND thrills,always a great combination.I am amazed at the attention paid to nearly every single detail here.For example,at the start of the film,Doc and Marty are in the parking lot of the ""Twin Pines Mall"".Then,shortly after Marty arrives in 1955,he accidently runs over one of old man Peabody's beloved pine trees.Toward the end, after Marty returns,the name of the mall changes.This is something you just don't notice until you see the film several times as I have. Excellent casting,particularly Christopher Lloyd as the unforgettable Doc Brown,the humor of the Ronald Reagan bit and the Johnny B. Goode sequence,along with the ultimate heart pounding ending and the attention to detail as I mentioned make this film as close to perfect as you will see in modern cinema.The sequels? Forget them.This is the only one of the trilogy you need to see.",5

16,14 November 2009,hitchcockthelegend,10, Earth Angel And The Nuclear DeLorean.,"It's 1984 and director Robert Zemeckis, fresh from the success of Romancing The Stone, is trying to film Back To the Future - a film about a young teenager called Marty McFly who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955 and inadvertently risks the future of his family. Zemeckis is troubled by his leading man, Eric Stoltz, who just isn't capturing the youthful teenager exuberance that he wants for Marty McFly. Stoltz is jettisoned and in comes Michael J. Fox who was busy wowing audiences in the hugely popular sit-com Family Ties. Fox had been first choice anyway but couldn't get a release slot from shooting with Family Ties. Luckily the wasted time with Stoltz created an opening for Fox to play Marty McFly as well as work on the show - the result of which would turn out to be one of the most beloved fantasy trilogies of the modern era.",6

If there ever was magic on screen, Back to the Future has it. By the end of the film, I was only thinking, ""Wow, Hollywood was once capable of putting magic on the screen."" It really makes you wonder if the best of Hollywood is behind us.",/

19,21 October 2015,tavm,10," After 30 years, the original Back to the Future is still the best of the series!","Today was the day me and my best friend from high school-who now works at the movie theatre that is showing these Back to the Future trilogies-saw these again, a little more than 30 years after this first one initially came out. Because the second one took place partially on October 21, 2015 was the reason for this series playing for that one day. Anyway, this first one was the best of them mainly because of the contrast between teen Marty McFly's '80s lifestyle and that of his parents' when they were teens in the '50s. Also, his relationship with Doc Brown was also a big part of the movie's phenomenal success. That and plenty of jokes about culture shock and great chase scenes. My favorite scene involved Marty playing heavy metal licks at the '50s dance sequence. And what great players like Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd handling their roles the way they do! And, yes, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson are also fine as Marty's parents and his father's bully, respectively. Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale fashioned a fine screenplay with excellent direction from Zemeckis. This is still my favorite '80s movie, bar none! So on that note, I definitely highly recommend Back to the Future. P.S. One of the most interesting things I now know about this movie is that the younger brother of Lorraine in the '50s sequence was played by Jason Hervey who was also in the other summer blockbuster of the summer of '85-Pee Wee's Big Adventure-and would later play Kevin Arnold's older brother, Wayne, on ""The Wonder Years"".",r

21,8 May 2015,JudgeChaos,10, My All Time Favorite Movie!,"When I was little, my mom bought this movie on DVD for my dad. He turned it on one day and I brushed it off as ""one of those weird old movies daddy likes"". Eventually, I came out, sat down, and watched it. And the rest was history. I was so in love with this movie, that for 80's day at my school, I dressed up as Marty McFly. Nowadays, I love the movie more than ever. My favorite thing about this movie is the relationship between Doc and Marty. Most of the time, when a kid or teen hang out with an older person in movies and TV, people think they're more than friends. How many jokes have you heard involving Batman and Robin's relationship? However, Marty and Doc's relationship is pure friendship. I'm really good friends with one of my drama teachers, so I know how strong that type of friendship is. What else can I say? I love everything about this movie! If you haven't seen this movie, go see it now. Like...right now. Stop what your doing and go see it.",f

23,15 July 2014,Hitchcoc,9, So Much Fun,"Lots of tongue in cheek. Some great characterization. A chance at redemption. These movies showed Michael J. Fox to be a wonderful comedic presence. It is sad what happened to him, but can there be a more impressive example of a person who has overcome the tribulations that life has given him. Whenever I see him in ""The Good Wife"" as the slimy, underhanded character lawyer he plays, I love that I can ""not like"" a man who is dealing with devastating Parkinson's. As the principle character in this movie, Marty is shoved from one situation to another in a time he only can guess at. He has to face the youth of his father, a febrile wimp who gets pushed around. Then, of course, there is the wonderful Christopher Lloyd as the professor. While one could never accuse this film of being true science fiction with all the implications of time travel, there is a kind of suspense that works very well. It's pure fun and is the best of the three films in my opinion.",=

27,13 August 2021,nickenchuggets,9, The man who was never born,"If you were born after 1980, chances are you have seen this movie at least once, and you probably love it. Even for audiences watching long after its hype has faded away, Back to the Future still manages to be an unforgettable (and funny) experience because of how original it is. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the movie follows a teenager named Marty (Michael J Fox) who is accidentally sent back in time to the mid 1950s, thus setting in motion a possible paradox which involves his parents never meeting each other. Of course this means Marty will no longer exist upon returning to the 1980s, so it's up to him to get his future parents into a relationship. I think it's safe to say this type of plot has been attempted only a handful of times before in motion picture history, and is one of the reasons why this movie is remembered so positively. Before his whole quest begins, Marty McFly is busy living out the average and mundane life of an 80s teenager in california. His father doesn't know how to stand up for himself, and is frequently bossed around by his colleague Biff. Marty's mother drinks incessantly, and Marty dreams of escaping this hopeless existence. Soon, Marty comes across a mad scientist named ""Doc"" Brown (Christoper Lloyd), and he showcases a time machine consisting of a DeLorean DMC car augmented with flux capacitors and plutonium. Brown opts to show Marty a demonstration of how the car works and punches in a date of 1955. Shortly after, Libyan terrorists sent by colonel Gaddafi show up unexpectedly and shoot Doc for stealing plutonium from them to power the car. Marty has no choice but to escape in the DeLorean, accidentally activating its time travel capability. Upon being sent back to 1955, Marty realizes he doesn't have enough fuel to get back to the 1980s. He decides to search around on foot and comes across an adolescent version of his father, only to find Biff has been bullying him since his school days. Marty's sole objective now is to somehow get his future parents, George and Lorraine, into a relationship so Marty will still exist 30 years from now. After sustaining a direct hit from a car at low speed, Marty is knocked out and Lorraine has to care for him. Later on, Marty comes across a younger version of Doc Brown and must let him know his life-threatening predicament. Although Brown says the only way to have enough electricity for time travel is getting struck by lightning, Marty luckily possesses a newspaper from the future that states a lightning storm is due to hit the area around the town's courthouse that night. Meanwhile, Lorraine's attraction to her future son continues to get stronger, which will cause a time paradox if George doesn't intervene soon. Marty somehow has to get George and Lorraine to go to the upcoming school dance together in a hurry, but Biff shows up and forces himself on her. George finally decides to make a change and punches him out, allowing him and his future wife to go to the dance unimpeded. After a particularly wild guitar performance by Marty playing Johnny B Goode (which wasn't even out at the time), he shows up at the courthouse when the storm is about to hit. The lightning strikes right as the DeLorean (with Marty inside) hits 88 mph, sending him back to 1985, but the car stops working right after. Marty returns back to the parking lot where Doc Brown first showed him the car, and shows up right as the Libyan terrorists are gunning him down. All seems lost, and it appears Marty's actions in the 50s have broken the consistency of space and time, but Doc reveals he's wearing a bulletproof vest. The next day, Marty finds out everything is right with the world. His father is an accomplished writer, his mother doesn't drink anymore, and Biff is now George's servant. At the end, Doc shows up in the DeLorean and tells Marty to come with him to the year 2015. Back to the Future is undoubtedly one of the 80's most remarkable films, and once you have seen it, it's clear why it has left such an impression on the millions who have done so already. There are many reasons why this movie is impressive even almost 40 years later, but I think the majority of it stems from how it tries to connect the older culture of the US with the new. When Marty is talking to his past relatives about sightseeing on JFK Avenue, one replies ""Who the hell is John F Kennedy?"" Another ironic moment comes when Marty encounters the young version of Doc Brown, and Doc doesn't believe he is really from the future. He asks him to prove his claims by telling him who the american president is as of 1985, and Marty answers Ronald Reagan. Doc Brown still doesn't believe it, saying how a hollywood actor would never be elected. Those are just two instances. There's tons of things like that in this movie. It also sometimes works to the detriment of the experience, such as when Marty is playing Chuck Berry at the school dance and kicks over an amplifier. The amp makes a reverb noise, which amps weren't capable of producing until the early 1960s. There's another part where you can clearly see disability signs on the roads, when these weren't around until the 1970s. Of course, the film makers couldn't get absolutely everything perfect, and that's understandable. These things are still there if you pay attention though. It's also interesting to remind people how back in the 80s, there was concern that this movie wouldn't even be popular since it wasn't indecent enough. This is a strange criticism considering how the film contains allusions to racism, rape, and most prominently, Marty's mother being incestuously attracted to him before he's even born. All this aside, Back to the Future has stood the test of time (pun intended) as not just one of the 80's best movies, but one of the best movies, period. Zemeckis has said he will not allow anyone to remake any of the 3 movies, and this was a very reassuring thing to hear.",u
28,29 July 2005,preppy-3,9, Shouldn't work...but it does,"HUGE 1980s hit movie. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox in his breakthrough role) has a miserable life. His father is a wimp, his mother an alcoholic and they live in a rundown area. His only friend is a crazy scientist (Christopher Lloyd). Lloyd turns a DeLorean into a time machine (don't ask) and Fox accidentally ends up in 1955. He also accidentally fumbles his parents first meeting--so his mom is falling for him!

29,11 July 2009,Tweekums,9, Great sci-fi adventure for all the family,One would have thought that a film made almost twenty five years ago about somebody travelling back in time thirty years would have dated terribly but it seems just as fresh now as when I first saw in on betamax all those years ago. I'm sure people will be enjoying it for decades to come.,v
30,8 July 2000,Quinoa1984,10, Old Man Peabody owned all of this!,"This is a memorable sci-fi comedy that will always be remembered for it's amazing visual effects and dolorian time machine.  Plot (if actually memorable) is about a regular teen (Michael J. Fox in one of his best performances) who is friends with a brilliant yet crazed doc (Christopher Lloyd is terrific as this Doc) who creates a time machine using a flux capasitor and 1.21 gigawots (what the hell is a giawot!).  But suddenly, McFly finds himself in 1955, 30 years earlier to his present date.  And not only does he have to get back to the future, he also has to reunite his parents after a incident.  Great fun with this cast and tale, with some great direction by Robert Zemeckis and from Steven Spielberg's Amblin entertainment.  The best one of the trilogy (though the other 2 are questionable).  A+",
31,5 August 2016,AlsExGal,9," Lots of fun, just don't think too hard","Why will this film be remembered? Well, I'd say the strength and chemistry of the characters alone makes it an eight. This film was perfectly cast even down to the supporting characters. Then there is that marvelous score that reflects the atmosphere and energy of the entire film and is immediately recognizable. And although the overall ground of time travel has been trodden before, this one addresses time travel and its implications on so many levels. There is the main story arc, but then there are lots of little ripples going out to the universe as a result of the present interacting with the past that you may have to watch it several times to catch all of the changes and all of the jokes.",
32,21 May 2004,Ben_Cheshire,10, The cleverest of the three.,"Part I is certainly the cleverest of the three. A rip-snorter of a premise: Marty (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent back to 1955 in the time machine that his friend Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd, in a zany, unforgettable, over-the-top performance that creates one of the best characters of all time) has built, and he accidentally interferes in the meeting of his parents, so that instead of his grandpa hitting his father (Crispin Glover in another over-the-top but crucial and memorable performance) with his car, he hits Marty instead. So instead of Marty's mother falling in love with his father, she falls in love with him! Controversial and awkward though it may be, you can't deny its greatness. The real aim of this, though, is not incest, its learning what his mother was really like in her youth, compared to how she tells it. Plus, it lends a certain urgency to what Marty must do to set back the course of time, which makes us need to watch till the end to see he does it: he must somehow make his parents meet and fall in love, or he won't be born!",

Our hero must now reunite his parents-to-be, lest he cease to exist in the 1980s. It won't be easy, especially with the loutish Biff, now also a teenager, complicating matters. Beyond its dazzling special effects, the best element of Back to the Future is the performance of Michael J. Fox, who finds himself in the quagmire of surviving the white-bread 1950s with a hip 1980s mindset.",

The charm and wit are so good it will have you wonder how they came up with such a concept, Michael J Fox is at his best as are the rest of the cast. Humour,comedy, science fiction, this film has it all. This film will remain timeless,I would urge anyone who loves films to add this one to their list now. The special effects are still great looking and look far better then most effects today, your heart will still be in your mouth when Marty races towards the clock tower in a bid to get struck by lightning, this is a film you will watch again and again and will always put a smile on your face.",

And it works on every level. Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a teenager living in the year 1985. He has a less than perfect life, as his parents George McFly (Crispin Glover) a nerd, and Lorraine McFly (Lea Thompson) a drunk don't connect. His two friends that we see are his girlfriend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Cristopher Lloyd) a crazy scientist. When one day when Doc. Brown invents a DeLoeran time machine Marty inadvertently goes back to the year 1955 where he sees George and Lorraine as high school students. He also sees George's future supervisor Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) and the current school bully. Marty has to meet up with 1955 Doc. Brown so that he can fix the DeLorean, hook it up to a lighting bolt to get the required electricity to go back to 1985 and prevent Doc. Brown from being killed by Libyan terrorists. As if that weren't enough things get worse when Lorraine becomes infatuated with Marty instead of George. Therefore this could prevent his own existence. So he has to get his parents to go to the dance together, fall in love, so he will even be a person. This movie like Ghostbusters will confuse the mess out of you if you think about too long. Just try to enjoy it. And this is entirely possible. This film is filled to the brim with funny lines, catchphrases, great acting, great characters, great jokes, and everything about it is great.

44,29 June 2008,Coventry,10, Brilliant Scenario!,"Few things are as difficult to accomplish as a movie dealing with time-traveling. To take on themes as risky as paradoxes and time loops you primarily need a healthy dose of courage and ambition, but most importantly loads of writing talent and cinematic vision. The scenario of ""Back to the Future"", courtesy of director Robert Zemeckis and co-producer Bob Gale, is honestly one of the most brilliant ones ever penned down and, thanks to the financial support of several acclaimed producers (including Steven Spielberg and Frank Marshall), it also became one of the most massively entertaining films of all time, with sublime special & sound effects, diversity of genres and some of the greatest casting choices and acting performances ever. ""Back to the Future"" is quintessentially speaking a Sci-Fi comedy, but Robert Zemeckis admirably also hints at the more emotional and melodramatic aspects regarding time traveling. Also, even though the film boosts some of the greatest effects ever, their use merely remains functional and occasionally, so that the emphasis continuously lies on the story and the development of the characters instead of on flamboyant machinery and overlong speeches about scientific theories. The DeLorean is a stylish and original piece of scenery, but other than the fantastic and already legendary vehicle there are no giant laboratories with thousands of flickering lights. Marty McFly is a typical mid-80's teenager with a skateboard he knows how to use and a delightful high school sweetheart that loves him very much. His parents George and Lorraine, however, are a pitiable and hopelessly old-fashioned couple and thus he spends most of his free time with his genius but slightly eccentric friend Doc Brown. The latter invented a time-traveling device and, following a series of bizarre events, Marty accidentally travels back to 1955; the year his parents met and fell in love during the school prom. Marty has only one chance to return to the future, but in the meantime he has to correct the events he tampered with in order to save the future and even assure his own birth. The script is very well constructed and literally stuffed with witty little details that refer to earlier events and/or events that have yet to appear, either later in the film or even in one of the sequels. The humor works, the light-headed tone and atmosphere puts a big smile on your face, you come to care for the characters and the awesome soundtrack even makes it difficult to remain in your seat. Michael J. Fox, Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson all give away excellent performances, but my two preferred roles are for Christopher Lloyd (with his confused looks and bizarre facial expressions, he makes a superb mad scientist) and Crispin Glover. The latter appears to be born to depict weirdos and uncanny freaks, so the role of introvert and mysterious George McFly fits him perfectly.",
45,21 October 2015,mmallon4,10, Spaceman From Pluto,"An aura of 'cool' permeates everything about Back to the Future. I could imagine seeing this film when it came out in 1985 (of course I wasn't alive) and watching Marty McFly riding through Hill Valley on his skateboard while holding onto the back of a truck to The Power of Love by Huey Lewis and the News and thinking to myself, ""omg, this is just the coolest film ever"". To me Marty McFly is the personification of cool, he rides skateboards, has a hot girlfriend, plays guitar. Yet his life is far from perfect; his dad is a dweb, his mum is an alcoholic and his uncle is in prison. This brings him down to a relatable level, plus he hangs out with a crazy old scientist. Why? I don't want to know. I like the mystery of not knowing how this unconventional friendship came to be. The technical jargon between Marty and Doc is a never-ending pleasure to listen and even lines which shouldn't be memorable are somehow highly quotable (""Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me that it's 8:25...dam I'm late for school!""). Likewise taking the coolest looking, commercially available car and making that the time machine is yet another stroke of genius. Notice the scene in which we see the DeLorean for the first time; it's impossible for Doc Brown to get inside the DeLorean while it is inside the truck so he would have had to get into the car and drive it into the truck and just wait there until Marty would show up and then drive it out and exit the car. I guess Doc thought he had made a time machine that looked so badass he really had to give it an impressive introduction to Marty. The whole movie has the best uses of product placements I've seen in a film; never before have I been happier to see advertisements for Pepsi and Texaco. The pacing of Back to the Future is perfect, the film never lets up; the odds keep stacking up against Marty and the suspense towards the end of the film is crazy.",

The cast is fantastic and one of the most vital parts of making this movie work, they didn't seem like easy characters, particularly Marty and Doc, they have a lot of layers and certain requirements for portraying them accurately, but every actor nails their role, the script has some very funny bits, but also dramatic parts, and the cast succeeds in all areas of acting. The story is quite complicated, it has the concept of time travel involved, thrown in with a complicated love story, as well as a lot of necessary character development, but it manages to perfectly bring all of this together in a movie that isn't even two hours long, and it dosen't manage to feel any bit cluttered or overlong.

Wilson: Inventive science fiction comedy about regret and change. It involves a time machine car that can propel into the future once it hits a certain speed. This is all explained through the crazed rants of Doc Brown before he is gunned down. Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly, a regular high school senior who dreams of success as a musician. At home he frowns on the fact that his father, George is constantly bullied by his high school rival Biff. Central plot regards Marty transporting back to 1955 to locate Doc and then reintroduce his future parents in a method that allows his father to sustain some dignity. The problem is that his future mother falls for him. Creative and charming with grand humour to boot. Director Robert Zemeckis gives it a nice appeal in the same vein as the famous Frank Capra classics. Fox brings a great innocence and desperation in his securing his parents as well as his own future. Christopher Lloyd as Doc, frizzy gray hair and all steals the film in his attempts to conquer time travel. Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson play the McFly folks in need of heavy reparation. Thomas F. Wilson provides much humour as the ruthless yet brainless school bully. It brings light to the fact that our parents were indeed teenagers once. Score: 9 / 10",

And he has just made a successful time traveling machine. A DeLorean to be specific. That's right, he made a time machine out of a cool looking and futuristic car. But when Marty is accidentally sent back thirty years into the past, to 1955, lots of bad stuff happens. He meets his mother, who accidentally starts falling for her own son, without realizing it. And since he has altered the space/time continuum, he must get his parents to fall in love, otherwise, he's going to fade away. With the help of past Doc, he successfully gets his parents back together and gets home. And when he gets back to 1985, we find out that his life has been altered, for the better.

My kids laughed at all the right parts, thought Marty and Doc funny, and were completely caught up in the excitement and suspense of the clocktower finale. During that clocktower finale, one of my daughters, who wasn't familiar with ""suspense"" as a film term said ""This movie is giving me ANXIETY!"" They were completely into the film, just as I was when I was 13 or 14 when I first saw it in the theater. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, who only had three movie credits to his name before this, the very funny TV movie ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" the very funny and very crass Kurt Russell comedy ""Used Cars,"" and then ""Romancing the Stone,"" which was an unexpected hit that led the studios to take a look at his other projects. If you're wondering how Spielberg got involved in this film, Zemeckis and his writing partner, Bob Gale, wrote Spielberg's infamous bomb ""1941,"" which I think is an under appreciated comedy classic I still love to this day. Spielberg also produced Zemeckis' first film ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and when the studio was uncomfortable with him selecting a first time director he stuck by Zemeckis but had to promise the studio if things went badly he'd take over as director. But I digress. In summary, ""Back to the Future"" has a great cast (even look fast for Billy Zane in his film debut as one of Biff's toadies), terrific humor, and genuine heart. Although seemingly lightweight, ""Back to the Future"" really is an American film classic. FUN FACT(s)! When Thomas F.

Basically Marty McFly (Golden Globe nominated Michael J. Fox) is the young aspiring teenage musician and friend of Dr. 'Doc' Emmet Brown (a fantastic Christopher Lloyd), and finds out that Doc has invented a time machine with a DeLorean car. It is run by tremendous power from plutonium, which he took from the Libyans, who find him and shoot him. When Marty escapes from them in the car and excels to 88mph (the speed needed to time travel) he is transported unintentionally to 1955 (which Doc set). Unfortunately, while looking for Doc to help him get home, he interferes with the history of his parents in this past, where they meet and fall in love, making his mother love him! Marty now not only has to get his parents, George (Crispin Glover, who did not return for the sequels) and Lorraine (Les Thompson) to fall in love again to restore history/the future, before he and his brother and sister are erased from existence, but the only power available instead of plutonium to get him back to the future (1985) is a bolt of lighting that will hit the clock tower (they know this from a paper he brought from 1985). A fantastic look at how time is so precious, and what can change from the tiniest history interference, aka time paradox. By the way, the plutonium was changed to trash in the end to help explain the sequels. Also starring Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen, Claudia Wells as Jennifer Parker (who was changed in the sequels to Elisabeth Shue) and Titanic's Billy Zane as Match. The story is original and though provoking, the characters are lovable, and the special effects are great, just a great film. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing, and it was nominated for Best Song for ""The Power of Love"", Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Screenplay, Best Special Visual Effects and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, Best Original Song and Best Screenplay.

Fox. Fox replaced Eric Stolz in the role of Marty McFly, a misfit of a teenager whose friendship with a loopy inventor named Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) gets him into quite the pickle. The Doc has actually invented a time machine that transports Marty back to the year 1955, where he meets his parents as teenagers and must unite them romantically in order to exist and return to the year 1985. This film is expertly mounted thanks to detailed direction and a rock solid screenplay. Fox is energetic as Marty McFly and gets wonderful support from Lloyd as Doc Brown and from Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson as his parents. Kudos as well to Thomas F. Wilson, who scores as a perpetual bully in Marty's life. The movie is full of laughs, scares, and even a touch of genuine warmth here and there. If you've never seen it, treat yourself.

I'll be turning 22 this year, as will this film. Robert Zemeckis has had an astounding career over the last half-century, with other hits including ""Forrest Gump"" (1994) and ""Cast Away"" (2000). But his best will always be ""Back to the Future,"" at least to me. In 1985, wacky, frizzy-haired scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) invents time travel, that is he builds a time machine out of a DeLorean. A series of harrowing events forces wise-cracking teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to take the DeLorean for a test drive through time, 30 years back to 1955, before he was even born. Never mind the scientific improbabilities and paradoxes present in the script, but McFly must find a way back to '85, before his future is erased by events in the present. You see, he has inadvertently altered the course of events that will lead to his then-teenage parents (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson) meeting and falling in love, and now he must try to get them together with a young Doc Brown's help while also facing off against Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), the local tough. ""Back to the Future"" remains a comedy classic, due largely to its mix of special effects fantasy and laugh-out loud moments.

He hopes to make a man out of his milquetoast father, the middle-aged George McFly (a deliciously funny sad sack as played by 20-year-old Crispin Glover) who is still groveling at the feet of his former high school classmate, a perpetual bully named Biff. Marty's prim mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson) appears to be drowning her frustrations in vodka. The movie does not really catch fire until, when testing out a souped-up DeLorean as a time machine with his eccentric, wide-eyed, wild-haired stork of a mad scientist friend Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (played by the hilariously frazzled Christopher Lloyd), Marty is whisked back to 1955. Here, he comes face to face with his nerdy teenage dad and also his unrecognizably gorgeous mom. After inadvertently causing his own mother to become infatuated with him – who finds him an absolute dreamboat, it is left up to Marty to repair the course of time and ensure that she falls in love with his future father, George or face being erased out of existence altogether. To do so, he gets in touch with a young Doc, who is as much a fish out of water in the past as he is in the present, and persuades him to send him back to 1985.

""Back to the Future"" is one of my favorite movies, and it is one of the best if not the best about time travel. There have been plenty of movies about time travel, but when it comes to time travel movies I think of this one. So with said, the movie is about Marty McFly who accidentally goes back in time to 1955 as he alters history by saving his father from getting hit by a car, and his mother for falling in love as well as his existence. So Marty has to put it all back as how things should be, while Doc Brown tries to get Marty back home to 1985. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd do work well together like bread and butter. Lea Thompson looks lovely and she really plays her role really well. The rest of the cast all did great. The movie itself is really funny, and it is also exciting too. The movie doesn't feature that many special effects by ILM, but I love the effects for the car traveling through time just as what it appears in the movie without any time travel sequence like having a portal or something. The design of the DeLorean for being used as a time travel vehicle is really iconic, and loved the way how it looks. The music by Alan Silvestri is so unforgettable, and loved hearing the theme that he created. The movie is very well scripted, and I thought Robert Zemeckis does a really good job on directing this movie after making another movie that is also good ""Romancing the Stone."" The production design for the 1955 scenes are outstanding, and I thought the pacing of the movie is top-notch. I really hope Hollywood doesn't try to remake this or the sequels, because they're fine for what they are; just like what everyone says ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" I have nothing against remakes, but sometimes it just gets lazy for Hollywood to try to come up with some new stories, and new ideas for what movie is there to make. So please, for one last time as I say this ""DON""T REMAKE THIS MOVIE OR THE SEQUELS!""

All of the people involved in the making of this film should be congratulated on a job well done. I always enjoy watching it again and I will never lose my enthusiasm for this film. The film could have been released five years before or five years after 1985 and for some reason I do not think it would have had the same effect. We will never know but suffice to say that it is a splendid romp that does not fall into the trap of being too serious and therefore works remarkably well.

But to this day, imagination still booms at the possibilities of traveling through space and time. To witness historic events. Or even see where our world is heading in the future. Pop quiz: How many films can you name in 30 seconds that deal with time travel? Quite a lot, right?! In 1985, along came Universal Studios. Taking the well-worn ""Time Travel"" formula, they set out to make one of the greatest sci-fi/action films of all time. In a word, BACK TO THE FUTURE is cool! The story: Cool kid Marty McFly (played by Michael J. Fox) is friends with quirky scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc has just built a time machine. Through a series of mishaps, Marty winds up back in the year 1955. Now, Marty's forced to track a much-younger Doc and convince the budding scientist to help him get back to 1985. Along the way, he's also bumped into his future-parents. Thus screwing up his own future. So now, he's got to find a way of getting his dad George (Crispin Glover) and mom Lorraine (Lea Thompson) to fall in love. But that's not going to be easy with the local bully, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), hanging around. The rest I'll leave for you to discover. It's an instant classic with eye-popping special effects and a stellar cast. Followed by two equally-strong sequels.

133,22 April 2015,hines_mark,10, Best ever. Period.,"What else needs to be said? Anyone that knows anything about filmmaking knows that this is the best film ever made. Try watching certain movies over and over and see how quickly you get sick of it. This movie is different. The depth and richness of storytelling, the characters, oh my, the characters. Doc Brown is easily one of the best and most memorable on screen characters in any film ever. Biff, Griff, Buford...best on screen bully ever! Compare this movie to other epic movies, such as Star Wars - while those types of movies are great in their own right, Back to the Future is different. There is a warmth and comfort to the way that Bob Gale and Bob Zemekis crafted this screenplay. It's pure genius. And for all of you fans that always have to mention ""plot holes"" or ""minor flaws"" - please make sure you have seen every second of the 25th Anniversary set of the trilogy that has an entire bonus disc, as well as more bonus features and two different commentaries on the main discs. Bob Gale is aware of every little detail about his script and talks about it in the commentaries. My true love of this film came as a result of watching all the behind the scenes material - which if you haven't seen, you must see it if you're a fan of this movie. It will give you a whole new level of appreciation for this film. As someone that is into filmmaking and a total nerd about directing, cameras, technical details, I can't get enough of watching and listening to these guys talk about how everything came together just right for this masterpiece to happen. I can't say enough about this film, its actors and all the people involved in making it. Truly something not to be rivaled and we will probably never see anything close to it ever again.",

Whilst this is rather 80's(and granted, that has a charm of its own... it can, however, also be really off-putting), it does stand up well enough, with few jokes and gags having aged poorly. ...is one of those bullies seriously wearing 3-D glasses? The characters tend to be well-done, if there are some really obvious stereotypes(but it seems intentional). Humor works pretty well, if it can be really silly and goofy at times. The dialog is good, some really memorable lines. You always understand the ""science"" aspect, without a lot of wordy explanations, and there is no technobabble. The music is catchy. Acting is great, other than some over the top performances(again, they didn't happen by accident). It's a fun, rewatchable High School comedy flick with time-travel. The climax is also surprisingly tense, for how predictable parts of this can be. I recommend this to any fan of the decade, the cast and the concept itself. 8/10",

It's over the top, kitschy, silly and lots of fun; pretty much what eighties movie making was all about. However, despite being an eighties time capsule; this movie is still well received to this day and will continue to be fun for cinema audiences for generations to come. The reason? Because in spite of being a predominantly fun flick; Back to the Future is a complete piece of cinema. It has it's heart in the right place, it's very funny, it draws themes and parallels from how times have changed, it has interesting characters that you can feel for and it's a lot of fun. Back to the Future is a masterpiece in it's field for all these reasons. We follow Marty McFly; a young slacker who is good friends with a genius inventor, Doc Brown.

158,3 July 2009,thesar-2,10, Go 'Back' to the Magic,"What teenage boy didn't want to be Marty McFly (Fox) if they grew up in the 80s? I certainly did. He had it all: someone he loved and loved him back, a best friend that could literally send him on adventures, played guitar in a band, a carefree spirit – using vehicles to accelerate his skateboarding, including a cop's and to be able to time-travel – catching his parents in future lies. I grew up on 'Back to the Future'; I must've watched it 50 times as a kid, never knowing I was taking for granted how much this comedic adventure masterpiece was completely unique and rarely a movie such as this comes around. Watching this now, having watched 1000s of movies since its release 24 years ago, I appreciate it all the more. The movie has great, pitch-perfect lines/comedy, extreme adventure, a heart, still well-made special effects and it certainly reminded me of how great movies used to be made: pre-CGI. Nothing against CGI, a lot of movies today benefit from the effect, but you have to appreciate the 50s town they recreated to scale, making me believe I was there. Marty accidentally gets sent back to 1955 by his best friend (played perfectly by Christopher Lloyd) Doc Brown and after a few scenes to convince him he's really back in time, he seeks the aid of Brown to get, well, ""back to the future."" At the same time, its damage-control with the paradox he creates that almost erases his own existence. Sure, it had minor flaws: Fox definitively didn't look like a teenager in the sequels –he barely pulls it off here and of course there's the typical 80s numerous product placements, down to the DeLorean itself – ironically, not enough to save the doomed car. Still, an absolute must-see.",

Although it does have more of an 80's feel than its sequels, I think Back to the Future will be enjoyed by audiences for many more years to come. The film has a wonderful blend of comedy, science fiction, and action so that it works on many different levels.

161,28 May 2014,KineticSeoul,9, A blast from the past!,"If you wanna watch a very intelligent time travel movie, this one isn't it. However if you wanna see the beginning of a fantastic, adventurous yet well interwoven, grafted and entertaining time travel trilogy this one is the ticket. The thing that makes this movie stand out and endure the test of time is the classic elements that makes a movie such as this memorable with likable characters. And a mission you actually care about as the audience members. Michael J. Fox is just great a Marty McFly who may seem like a typical 80's main teenage character, but there is certain aspects about him that makes him a cool and stands out from the rest. Maybe it's his capability to stand up to bullies even if he is smaller in stature. While also having the courage to follow his dreams and how he conducts himself, despite his flaws of not being able to turn down a challenge. But Christopher Lloyd is the guy that just plain downright nailed it as the wacky scientist Dr. Emmett Brown. Even when it came down to the main villain Biff played by Biff Tannen, who is basically a generic bad guy of this trilogy, but certain elements makes him kind of a stand out villain for me. Maybe because you can see different versions of him, even if he is the bad guy all the way through. Watching this movie was like watching a Jerry Bruckheimer movie with a touch of Spielberg's elements, except this trilogy will go down as a classic trilogy. This may seem like a typical 80's movie from the surface, but it has a lot of elements that makes it brilliant. It's difficult to describe in words, but this movie, this trilogy just works and will stick with you. When it comes to the story it's actually very simple, but sometimes the simple aspect of a film makes it more worthwhile sometimes even if it deals with time travel. Watching this even now I can understand why a movie like this can be a timeless classic and give kids a colorful imaginative ideas. I for one tried to build a time machine with my brother when we were younger after watching this movie and had a blast! ",

I actually feel what is like to be a teenager in that period just by looking at the way they act. The script and the way it is made OMG i seriously don't know where to begin. All the jokes and punchlines are so carefully implemented, this movie has so many references to both real things like the joke with Ronald Reagan and things from the bttf universe, to give an example it would be the continuous repetitions that are always placed cleverly and even if you get a feeling of what is next you always end up satisfied. What this movie really tries to emphasize is that history repeats itself and that we create our own destiny. The amazing thing about this movie is how Marty travels back in time, a place where we believe we know everything about and we are somehow still mind-blown by every character and action and feeling .You just cannot not get that chill when u think of how irreversible time is and the way this movie captures all these emotions is simply extraordinary.

Back to the future is cute, funny, and an obvious classic. I know most of us have seen them, but i'll say what it's about. This is the first of three Back to the Future films. Marty Mcfly(the great Michael J. Fox) is a teen with boring parents, and a boring life and he has a girlfriend. His life is turned upside down when his friend Dr. Emmet Brown(the great Christopher Lloyd)shows him a delorean. Which is actually a time machine.That's where the entire trilogy began and the films continued after that. I love every Back to the Future film. I like the original the most, then I like parts II and III equally. The Back to the future films are nothing but fun and they're great movies. This is definitely Robert Zemekis's best film to date. He's done other great films like Romancing the stone, Beowulf, and Death Becomes her. Not one of the Back to the future films has any weakness. Back to the future is a film that should never be remade or anything. Knowing the world today, if they did remake it, then they would cast Shia Lebeouf as Marty. Michael j.

203,27 January 2006,ODDBear,10, Just perfect,"What makes a good comedy movie? Just lots of dumb, pointless humor and no real plot. But what makes a good movie? A film with every feature containing quality, even the humor. So to have a really good comedy movie, at least in my opinion, it has to have EFFECTIVE humor WITH a point behind it, mixed with a good plot, good acting, storyline, and have a realistic feeling behind it. In other words, the humor must be something believable and of the possible. And it must all blend seamlessly with the rest of the quality parts of the film. And we get all of that in Robert Zemeckis's classic science fiction/comedy film ""Back to the Future"". This is the kind of comedy film that I wish we would see more often. It's like ""Forrest Gump"", it takes a realistic approach to life and then just blends it with the humor so that the audience doesn't concentrate so much on just laughing, but also understanding the plot and characters just as they would with a serious film. And as soon as they're done laughing at the lifelike jokes, then they focus back on the rest of the film.",

The performances are fabulous. The music is fabulous. Great characters, great dialogue, great effects. Pretty much great everything. And even if you know the movie by heart, and at this point I pretty much do, it doesn't get old. Not a bit. I'll go back in time with Marty McFly over and over again.

There's the old dilemma of all the paradoxes of timelines and butterfly effects and the awkward problem of trying to create conflict where the previous events have already established a status quo. Back to the Future neatly sidesteps this problem and presents an energetic mishmash of genres that became an instant hit and spawned an eager following. The script's building blocks pull together the plot intricately. Every little hint, every anecdote and appearance from the current timeline (Goldie Wilson's re-election van, the lighting struck clocktower) is re-enacted through the time machine back in 1955. You can only imagine the delight of audience at first seeing a young George McFly being subject to the same treatment, and recognising the fateful accident of the car hitting the young boy and gasp at how suddenly, the future is being morphed. And so we have a intriguing premise established so elegantly. ",

209,5 November 2009,Stampsfightclub,9, Science and time travel has never been more fun,"I wasn't excited to review Back To The Future because it has become a very popular film, but, after watching it again, I took out my pen and some recycled paper to get it over with. Before writing my review, I read and watched a number of materials about the making of the film. In my opinion, Back To The Future is one of the best science fiction films, even if it is a product of a big Hollywood studio (in this case Universal Pictures). It's one of the founding films in the special effects action blockbuster genre, though few of its successors have half its wit, charm or grace. The entertainment industry now realizes how important it is, and, therefore, the film has been promoted in the media and at conventions. But that's fine. I like it too. So, why do many people like Back To The Future? Firstly, it's an entertaining science fiction comedy. Secondly, its message of changing one's life for the better with a courageous act appeals to the masses. Thirdly, it's a well-cast and well-made 1980s movie. Back To The Future is simply pleasant to watch. Americans can watch it and be reminded of better times - the 1980s and especially the 1950s. Robert Zemeckis directed two good films before Back To The Future - the comedies Used Cars (1980) and Romancing The Stone (1984). In Back To The Future, Zemeckis demonstrated his technological savvy and attention to detail. The DeLorean DMC-12 time machine looks fantastic. The car was chosen because its design made the gag about the family of farmers mistaking it for a flying saucer believable. When it comes to the excellent cast, the friendship of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) works very well. It's entirely believable, and it works even better in the sequels - Back To The Future II (1989) and Back To The Future III (1990). The eager, likable Fox is actually good when it comes to the comedy. Also, his upbeat approach to his roles made him perfect for the part of Marty. Lloyd, as the irascible, sardonic Doc Brown, offers sterling support. Another excellent performance is by Crispin Glover as George McFly, the cowardly, nerdy father of Marty. In fact, Glover's performance may be the most effective in the film, and he's funny when it comes to George's nerdy mannerisms, such as his shaky hands. Lorraine Baines-McFly is actress Lea Thompson's most famous role. Zemeckis wanted her for the part after he saw her in The Wild Life (1984), opposite Eric Stoltz. Stoltz played the part of Marty before Zemeckis determined that he had been miscast. It turns out that Thompson is good at impressions. I found her body movements and facial expressions interesting as she played the somewhat shy 1950s teenager Lorraine. She's especially effective in the second half of the film. In addition to the lovely plot and perfect cast, Back To The Future features a wonderful music score by Alan Silvestri. The rock band Huey Lewis and the News provided two catchy songs - The Power of Love and Back in Time. So, there's a lot to like about the film. It's an appealing slice of bourgeois Americana. I have a few issues with its messages, but I definitely recommend it.",

Marty, to avoid being shot himself, climbs aboard the time machine and is accidental sent back in time to when his father met his mother.

Then ""Star Trek"" used up the premise in its TV episodes and films, and there was even that ""Time Tunnel"" TV series in the mid-sixties. One option was to do such a movie with humor, pointing out the potentially absurd ramifications of traveling to your own past. So the main character of Marty McFly (Fox) ends up meeting his own parents when they were his age. Though this is a relatively tame comedy as far as teenage comedies of the eighties, there is the risky Oedipal element of Marty's own mother having the hots for him. This concept is then tossed aside near the end when, in a rather lame scene, his mom stops her advances because she suddenly feels like she's kissing her own brother. Disney should've went with this after all - it's possibly the least offensive picture of the decade and probably also explains its huge popularity - everyone could enjoy it.",

But when he travels back in time and visits his mother's house at the time he was young he has a huge problem which is that his teenage mother is in love with him instead of his future father. Zemeckis really knows good visual effects, a film i consider the best science fiction movie from the 1980's sine executive producer Steven Spielberg's 1982 classic E.T. The Extra Terrestrial.

Wilson, and Crispin Glover. Robert Zemeckis does an amazing job of putting the movie together, and he joins Bob Gale in writing a well-written tribute to science fiction. The sound is super and superb, the visual effects are groundbreaking, the cast is incredible, the soundtrack is awesome, the score is amazing, the characters are well-memorable, and everything about this movie makes me wait for more, and I'm always entertained by this movie, even when watching over and over again.

The 80's spawned a rich variety of franchise films and the Back To The Future series can be considered one of the better ones. Central to the success of the film are the performances, this is a science fiction blockbuster relatively light on special effects and more concerned with character and plot. All the actors are great, Lloyd and Fox of course,but praise must also go to Crispin Glover who plays his wet blanketed nerd with a heart role to perfection. The script is sharp and the production design is outstanding with a picture postcard image of the 1950's well realised and the Deloreon time machine a great touch. Zemeckis' last film Romance In The Stone proved how well he could handle entertaining popcorn movies and he succeeds beyond expectation here with a highly energised, fun packed time travelling adventure to remember.",

Here you have a young slacker named Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) who meets this crackpot scientist Dr. Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd) who builds a time machine out of a DeLorean: America's Flop Car that'll remain memorable in this movie. Spoofed off H.G. Wells ""Time Machine"" ""BTTF"" is memorable all the way. Meeting your folks would be fun, but tampering with the past is not a game. Marty has to learn that hard. I liked the parts where he meets his father in the diner, and watch his future wife undress. Marty knew his father was a ""peeping tom"" when he was younger. Then trying to make a difference in their lives was the big part from keeping him and his siblings from non-existence was a bigger challenge. When everything was restored, Marty's finally changed for the better, though he introduced the skateboarding craze which one of the kids were amazed completely. Sticking to the dreams is important, listening to Dr. Brown is a must. Robert Zemeckis is a genius, and he really put up a solid cast and characters for the movie. The music rocks!

His brother is an air head that works at Burger King and his sister is doomed to the same fate as her mother so it seems.

Messing with things that happened he altered the future and was forced to keep doing everything so he could still be alive. Emmett is very funny with his unusual behavior and overall joy, also his excitement about everything and his troubles that he constantly experienced made him an very memorizing character. While messing with past after going back to the present and hoping to prevent killing of Dr., Marty found that some of scenes changed and Emmett was alive after shooting. Ending was probably most exciting thing in the whole movie as Marty found out that everything is changed and also when Emmett arrived back he took him back to future to prevent something that happened to their children. Music was fantastic with some of very popular songs. Movie is funny at many way but also creates this extraordinary situations that constantly need to be fixed. 4/4",

Some of the metaphysical aspects of it may be a little off kilter to do with time casuality, past/present etc..  But that does not stop it from being immensely entertaining, and the basic idea and theories behind the concept of time travel are reasonably correct.

All these side-stories are either predictions in 1955 of what 1985 will have, or they add tension. Marty has to take care of all these problems before he can go back to 1985.

301,3 August 2016,kingsleyoafus,10, The Best Movie Of All Time,I seen this a few days ago since it was Back To The Future Day and I haven't seen it in a long time. The story is about a young teen named McFly(played by Micheal J Fox)who teams up with a Dr played by Christopher Lyold who happens to be a time traveller. So he invents this car that can bring you back in time. So McFly ends up taking the time travelling car and ends up in the year October 21st 1955 where he has to try and bring is parents back together again. But when McFly's mother ends up falling for McFly things get sorta complicated. So can McFly go back to his own time?,

The film follows Marty McFly as he has traveled to 1955 and must find a way to travel back to 1985. This is without a doubt the best time travel movie in the history of time travel movies. I love the imagination that it took Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis came up with in creating this masterpiece. I can watch this movie over and over again and not get bored with it. This is how you do a time travel movie. If you want to make a good time travel movie all you need is a good screenplay, music, special effects, acting, the whole nine yards. And this movie delivers and makes time travel sound easy as it breaks it down simple for the audience to understand. Back to the Future makes me want to go to back to a time where everything was simple that we didn't have smartphones or technology that we have now. This is how you do a science fiction movie without being confusing for the audience. I can watch this movie over and over again and not get bored out of my skull. It also makes me want to go to in time when I haven't even heard of this movie and tell my future self to explore this masterpiece.

322,8 April 2017,studioAT,4, Good fun,"I like this movie okay. It was not something that I would really want to have in my DVD collection as I am more into horror than comedy, but this movie was entertaining. This is mainly due to Christopher Lloyd than anything else, the man brings real energy to his role. Michael J. Fox was good to in the lead role, one has to wonder if ""Family Ties"" held him back a little as he had some rather successful movies during the 80's and could have done more without the television commitment. This one is about time travel, time travel to the past. The next film would feature time travel to the future and the past. That one is a film I can not watch, it is just to hard to for me. It also has not aged well as the future they paint is a future of the 80's, as fashion is never going to be like that I am afraid. This one though has a guy use the professor's time machine and ending back in the past where he kind of interrupts the first meeting of his mother and father. This in turn makes it so he may no longer exist shortly. Thankfully, the professor is around and so he has to work on getting the time machine, which is a car, in working order and Fox has to work on getting his parents back on the right track. Like I said, this one works, as you can recreate a time that is past, the second one doesn't because you can not see what the future is going to be like. The third one though was okay.",
323,30 October 2010,Aaron1375,7, Good time traveling comedy.,This movie deserves to be amongst the classics. Michael J. Fox did outstanding and who could ever forget Christopher Lloyd in his role as Doc. He made me think that there actually was a real Doc. Both actors are excellent along with Crispin Glover playing George McFly. Glover does very well in his roles. I would like to see him in better movies. I chose the sequel over the original though. The reason being that the sequel involved new stuff and a bit of the original stuff. This movie should not be forgotten. There wont be one like it.

The lines and characters of Marty, Doc Brown, and Biff are very likable and-or memorable. Some of the lines that these 3 characters say are some of the most memorable lines. Since ""No Luke, I am your father."" The acting in this motion picture, although not Oscar worthy, is in fact fact great. Michale J.

330,13 June 2010,The_Depressed_Star_Wars_fan,10, One of the Best Science Fiction movies out there.,"1986 may be the month of July when i was at vacation form my school my bros brought this film home. For the first time i saw Michael.J.Fox , at that time i enjoyed the movie but not that much until when i turned 18 this very same movie was aired on a local channel here in my home town Lahore-Pakistan. At time i was able to understand the subject matter of the Hollywood movies better. That was so funny and also enjoyable watching but imagining your self traveling through time to same place and location where you belong 30 years backward the time in which you don't even exist. Then suddenly you happen to meet your own father who is same old you are now (shocking to unbelievable extant) than ending up inside a home being unconscious lights turns on , a young lady taking care of you sits in front of you ,you scream and become speechless because she will give you birth as your own mother. Meeting than your own grand parents and also meeting especially your youngest maternal uncle who is just a baby but in the future he will become a symbol of humiliation for whole family. Michael.J.Fox now tries to bring closer his parents together , but in a new manner as his future father is quite a weak personality and under confidant ,his mother was inside regretting her decision of marrying him ,another problem is their course met who is after her mother he is kind of jerk and also want to be dominating as his ancestors. But the most funny thing is that his mother falls for him (her own future son she does not know yet). On the other hand i found the most funny but cute character Christopher Lloyd the man who invented the time machine, he introduces Michael Fox to the machine(another funny thing , his dog name is Einstien). My whole family and circle of friends admired it very much and even it became popular in our country(it was also presented in theaters in 86-87), some people here were wondering is it possible. In the future it could be but it demands a lot of energy of solar stars ,BBC once predicted in sci-fi program hosted by X-files Gillian Anderson But it will take years maybe centuries till then keep on enjoying and imagining such cute fantasies.",

Fox) and a scientist Dr Emmett Brown ""Doc"" (Christophor Lloyd) went back in time to 1955. Actually Marty was going back in time, because Doc was shot and he was already there in 1955. Things have changed around Hill Valley in 1955. Well there's a young George McFly (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson). Things go fine until Biff Tannen (Thomas Wilson) shows up. Now things turn creepy when Emmett Brown does not know Marty in the 50's. They have to get back to 1985 by a bolt of lightning, which it strikes at night. Now they have to get George and Lorraine to the school dance. Now Marty is prepared to back to 1985. Then Emmett was suspecting that Marty was supposed to go back, but he came back from the future. It's a absolute classic, and I would recommend watching this, especially on TV, or on the trilogy set on DVD (Which I have, but unfortunately, I only have the full frame version, I don't have the widescreen version of this, sorry) But it doesn't matter, you get the movie anyway.

A major hit when it first came out which I think had more to do with how well it was marketed then how good of a movie it was.  Michael J. Fox carries the film with his charm and his ability to do physical comedy.  The story jumps back and forth from serious to silly which keeps us giggling and the good guys win in the end which usually makes for a winner at the box office. The focus of most of the comedy has to do with Michael trying to get his parents together despite his unexpected intervention into their lives and being his mom's flame for awhile putting a damper on his real mom and dad getting together.

For a movie that had such a rocky start from the production point of view and whose very creators didn't have much faith in, it sure made box office waves all around the world and made it one of the most fondly remembered and classical movies of the 80s. It catapulted Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd to stardom and turned one of the biggest automobile failures of the 80s into an iconic vehicle.
Everything seemed to fall into place for this one. Not only the screenplay, but the acting, directing, production design, visual effects, editing and cinematography. It's an extremely tightly edited movie, not a moment wasted, it moves along like lightning, and after all this years, its 80s look hasn't aged it one bit. This is one of the most entertaining cinematographic experiences ever and if you still haven't seen it; What are you waiting for?. Let's go back in time!!""",
360,22 January 2019,nirome,10, The perfect script,"When you're reviewing a film that you love, it's hard sometimes to describe all the things that you love about it. Which is the greatest challenge I have in reviewing this. I'll try not to go into too much detail, but I will also try to go in as deep as possible as to why I love the film. When the film opens we're introduced to the Character of Marty McFly. He's a typical 80's teen, but also good natured at heart. Marty has dreams and aspirations of being a rock star, but is too unsure of himself to pursue them. He is best friends with the eccentric but lovable, Dr. Emmett Brown. We don't know how Marty and Doc became friends, but we can understand why they are. Doc is always guiding Marty to do what is right, and indirectly showing him to never give up. Their relationship in the film is one I really love, Because Doc is not just a mentor to Marty, he's also a somewhat surrogate parent. The plot is simply this: Doc calls Marty up, and asks him to come help him with his new invention: A Delorean time machine. Things go wrong, and Marty ends up sending himself back in time to 1955. Shortly afterward, Marty accidentally interferes with his parents meeting. So Marty must now try to repair the damage he caused, while Doc tries to find a way to send Marty back home. So, what do I love about the film? To begin with, everything! I love the film's concept: If I knew my parents in high school, would I be friends with them? When you're a kid, the only way to find out how your parents acted when they were your age was to ask a grandparent or relative, but think how different and exciting it would be to actually see it! I love the film's message: ""Never give up, and never stop trying."" I love the performances that all the actors give, and I love the re-creation of the '50's atmosphere. (I'm a big fan of '50's movies, music, and TV shows.) I just love the film all around. Would I recommend this to someone who hasn't seen it? YES, absolutely! Back to the future is one of those movies that you can watch multiple times, and with each time, it still holds as much magic as the first.",
361,11 April 2014,Eightiesjunkie,10," ""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.""","I grew up loving this movie. I have surely been watching this movie some hundred times. The first time I was watching this movie was surely when I was about six years old. I knew Michael J. Fox - I just didn't know his name. I recognized him overall - in Spin City, The Frighteners etc. I had no good understanding of this movie when I was six years old, but hey, I was fascinated. Some five years later, I watched this again. With full understanding of this movie, I was not only fascinated - I completely loved it.

I had never seen a more enjoyable and witty movie in my life till then. About the time I was a teenager, thinking about what I would not do to go back in time and change things in the past!!! The 'time travel' trilogy is, I think the best that is, though not scientifically accurate. Robert Zemickis' shots of the DeLorean were amazing and well cut (though somebody reported seeing black gloves on some remote-controlled shots of the DeLorean! - frankly I could not make out the gloves. OK, maybe I am blind!). Michael J. Fox as the young ambitious Marty McFly and his 'Someday Jeniffer, Someday!' remain embedded in my mind. I think Fox plays the teenager to utmost perfection. I have never seen a teenager like that in my entire life!!! Doc Brown remains the most memorable scientists ever played in Hollywood! Christopher Loydd was impeccable, amazing!!! Kudos to Robert Zemickis for creating one of Hollywoods greatest characters in comedy! Amazing performances by Thomas Wilson (Biff Tannen) and Crispin Glover who plays the wimpy 'dad'.

The setting and years that the film took place I suppose could've been better, I think I would've preferred there to have been scenes involving 3 different years in this movie but just having 1955 and 1985 worked very well with the complex entertaining plot this film gives us. 1950's and 1980's USA are certainly not my favourite historical periods but they are both definitely interesting history periods so overall I really liked it and loved seeing the contrast and changes of the various buildings in Hill Valley in 1955 and 1985. It would've only made small difference in years in the film's time setting but I would've preferred Marty to have gone back to 1960 or the late 1950's instead of 1955 and had pretty much the same story with his parents except it would be 4 or 5 years later and that way they'd be more of a Rock n Roll, greaser and rocker culture in the past setting of this film, but that's just my personal preference.",

375,13 October 1998,RMeijer,10, Best movie ever seen,"This was one of my favorite movies from the time I was little. Even though my parents rarely let me watch it because ""it had to much cussing"". But I still loved it. Greatest time travel movie ever. (Even if the time travel makes no sense)
What is about this movie that makes it superior to almost ever other movie I have ever watched.
The defining feature of this movie is the humor and it is really quotable. ""I'm Darth Vader from the planet Volcon"" ""You're my density"" "" So you're tellin' me that you built a time machine, out of a dalorine"" ""Hello its your cousin Marvin, Marvin Berry. You know that new sound you've been looking for, well listen to this.
It is without a doubt the best movie about a kid going back in time for his mom to have the hots for him. ""So you're tellin' that my mom has the hots for me, whoa this is heavy"".
You could nit pick this movie all day. Yes! it is a plot convenience that all the these important events happen within a week together in 1955. Though it makes perfect sense that they were all brought up in the future. Why does Marty slowly disappear instead of instantly. Though these are both worthy sacrifices for the story.
This movie is so funny and I could go through the whole movie and pick out something every 10 seconds. Though to be a highly regarded classic there needs to be more than just humor. Marty is an average kid living in 1985 with the exception that he hangs around with a crazy scientist. Marty has a girlfriend and seems to be annoyed by the faults of his family, rightfully. Trough out his journey into the past he holds in his mind that Doc has been shot dead when he leaves. He tries to tell him the whole movie about the future, but he does not want to hear. But Doc thought ""What the hell"" . (Which the motivation does not make a whole lot of sense, though he did have 30 years.) Though it is rewarding and heart warming when you see Doc listen and stay alive.
Doc is mostly funny, but also misunderstood for because he is actually a genius, he made a time machine. ""Great Scott!"" ""1.21 gigawatts"" ""The fulx copasitor this is what makes time travel possible""
The mom is funny, just by the fact she is into her son, but in the end she realizes it. ""When I kiss you it feels like I'm kissing my brother."" ""I have never seen anyone wear purple underwear before.""
The best character with the most growth is George McFly. He never stands up to anyone, but Marty is successful in getting him to stand up against Biff (Even better than the original plan). ""Hey you get your dam hands off of her"". The music and the score is great. And even better his guitar performance at the end.
Biff is terrible and the worst and that is what is great about him, when Marty stand up to him you love it, when manure is dumped on him you love it, and best of all is when George punches him.
The movie is not really about character growth, except for George and for Marty it was just ""Educational"". The movie is really held together by the race against time to send Marty back to the future, and of course every thing goes wrong until it doesn't. It is thrilling and rewarding as the movie drags you along as the music invokes one of the strongest senses of nostalgia.
This movie is superior to both the sequels, even though they are just as much apart of one of the greatest trilogies ever. This movie is timeless and always delightful. It is in my top 10 favorite movies. 10/10.

I found that part a little messed up, but also arousing. Although Biff was a complete jerk towards George McFly and acted like a creep to Lea Thompson's character. I found the part amazing and scary when George McFly had the balls to fight off Biff from him almost raping Lea Thompson.

What is it about this film that makes it endlessly watchable? The main character is a kid i wanted to be. I even tried to copy his famous skateboard trick on a number of occasions- each time managing to hurt my shin in the process. The film centres around Marty Mcfly played by Michael J. Fox. He is accidentally transported back in time to the year 1955 where he inadvertently prevents his parents from falling in love-hence threatening his very existence. It may sound complicated but the genius of the film is the simplicity of the script. In short, Marty just wants to get back home. To assist him in his quest is the man who helped him get there in the first place (you still with me? good). Doc Brown is as eccentric as they come but Christopher Lloyd makes him lovable with his great performance. The chemistry between Michael J. Fox and the afore mentioned Lloyd is the key to the entire movie. It works a treat, making the film come to life. Watching Marty and Doc struggle to put their well thought out plan into action at the film's climax is as exciting as anything seen. The scale of this movie is not huge. It's not a big special effects film. Yes it does involve time travel and yes it's a big adventure. However, it's the characters-not a big budget- that make this film special. The score makes the film jump out of the screen.. The Back To The Future main theme is one of the most recognised in cinema. Only very special films tap into popular culture and this movie sits proudly alongside the Star Wars' and Indiana Jones'of this world.. The phrase 'Back to The Future' will be with us forever- just as this classic movie will be. 'Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads'",

413,7 August 2002,TheMan3051,10, AWESOME!!!!,"""Back to the Future"" was one of my all-time favorite movies when I was a teenager. It's a funny, exciting sci-fi/fantasy/comedy that today is still perfect for all ages. Michael J. Fox stars in his best film role as a teenager in 1985 who goes back in time 30 years earlier to 1955 in a DeLorean time machine and in the process meets his parents (Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover) while they're teenagers. He also catches up with his mad scientist friend (Christopher Lloyd) who built the time machine and tries to help Fox find a way to get him back to the present day. Director Robert Zemeckis made ""Back to the Future"" a winning film all the way around. Fox is terrific here. So are Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover. The writing (by Zemeckis and Bob Gale) is fresh and original, the directing outstanding, and the technical elements (ranging from the terrific production design to the rousing music score to the superb special effects) are dazzling. ""Back to the Future"" was a great '80s movie, and one of the decades biggest smash hits. Also a big asset, an awesome soundtrack featuring two great songs sung by Huey Lewis just for this movie (""Back in Time"" and the Oscar-nominated ""Power of Love""). The two sequels that followed simultaneously in 1989 and 1990 failed to live up to this one. In this trilogy, the original ""Back to the Future"" is the only one worth seeing.",

417,13 January 2020,dimas_abd,9, Great Scott! What a Movie!,"Before yesterday, 03 July 2008, I haven't seen this Robert Zemeckis picture since long time ago, I think actually since I was a kid, when this was one of the regular pictures showed on National TV together with the part II and the part III. I think saw the Back to the Future trilogy at least two or three times yet right now I don't remember a lot of things from part II and III just like before yesterday of part I. So right now I'm glad I saw this one after so many years; Back to the Future is the quintessential movie entertainment with two memorable characters, one memorable car and, of course, a magnificent time travel story full of fun and romance but not in a near or far future but in 1955. Well in the film is 1985 and Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is in high school, loves to play guitar with his band, is ready to spend more time with his girlfriend Jennifer (Claudia Wells) and the scientist and inventor Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is his friend. Here we also meet Marty's parents, George (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine (Lea Thompson), and also the abusive boss of George, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson). But is the Doc the one who is going to change everything for Marty with his latest invention that could be his own masterpiece: a De Lorean that works as a time machine.",

After countless (upwards of two dozen) viewings, I am convinced that it is flawless and in my opinion, the most enjoyable movie ever made. The movie's premise is teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) goes back in time and screws up his parents' first meeting. What separates this from any other sci-fi movie is the constant humor and more than anything, the fun that everyone so clearly had in making it. The actors are all great and perfectly cast, and the movie is never boring; literally every moment is enjoyable. And it seems to get better with every viewing. From the opening song ""The Power of Love"" to the fantastic climactic ""Enchantment Under the Sea"" Dance, Back to the Future will captivate you. My favorite movie of all time is a timeless classic that will never get old and gets better every time I watch it. A perfect 10/10!",

426,7 January 2021,aislinn-23017,9, A classic movie,"Marty McFly (Fox) is the average American kid who loves skate- boarding, chasing girls and getting late to school. His father keeps getting bullied by his supervisor, Biff (Wilson), his mother is an alcoholic and his elder siblings don't seem to have any aim in life. He has be-friended the local crazy scientist, Dr. Brown (Lloyd) whom the entire town considers to be mentally unstable. Dr. Brown has managed to create a time machine by modifying a DeLorean which needs a speed of 88 mph before it can travel through time and which also uses Plutonium. Dr. Brown had stolen the Plutonium from the Libyans and whilst showing Marty the functioning of the device, the Libyans attack Dr. Brown and Marty manages to escape back in time to the year 1955. Since he was out of Plutonium, Marty could not go back to the actual year and hence needed to find the younger Dr. Brown and take his help in going back to the future. 1955 was the year when Marty's father George (Glover) fell in love with his mother Lorraine (Thompson) but sadly, Lorraine takes a liking towards Marty himself. Marty realises that if he comes in the way of his parents, he might alter the future altogether to the point that he himself would seize to exist. The movie is a hardcore science-fiction movie that is a complete entertainment package. Although the story and developments might come across as being clichéd, the movie has some very good twists and a gripping climax to make this movie a wonderful watch. Many sci-fi movies end up looking too cheesy because of bad execution of the 'futuristic technology' but this movie seems to pull it off with ease which looks believable even 27 years later. A brilliant movie and a must-watch.",

The film has all the major genres drama, adventure, fantasy, and comedy. Boy was I right Back To The Future continues to get numerous broadcast on cable networks especially TBS, I have probably watched Back To The Future 100 times and I own a VHS copy. The reasons I find the film so entertaining are first the wonderful acting of Michael J. Fox and Lea Thompson, Michael J. Fox is always entertaining to watch due to his wit and comedic ability. Lea Thompson is eye catching she has underrated beauty. Second I first saw Back To The Future only by chance, I was going to see a minor league baseball game, but due to a rain storm that caused the game to be canceled me my father and uncle made a trip to the theater, despite being a couple of minutes late, we still watched a delightful movie. Hey just as in time travel things don't always go as planned. Hint: Back To The Future. Finally Back To The Future is a tribute to any history buff, if your like myself and enjoy the past it would be a dream come true to travel back in time, especially to see your parents fall in love, see the shape of a community and how it changed to the present, but to already know the outcomes. Finally you must have drama and conflict in the past so you can really enjoy your present state example: Marty's struggle to get his parents to meet and fall in love and to get back to the future, and remember you can't take the place of your father in the past it could be disastrous Quote: of Dr. Brown.

They aren't part of the same family like in Rick and Morty and they aren't close neighbors. Doc isn't a teacher at Marty's school and he's not a tutor for Marty. How does an average high schooler know a random insane scientist? I think they should've started the film with a flashback explaining it, but it's not that big of an issue.

And that's the slant - it feels like it was formulaicly designed to have as much mass-audience appeal as possible. Much like Indiana Jones or the MCU, this tries to take you back to those Saturday Morning Cartoons - hip young teen and his mad scientist friend and their time-travelling rock'n'roll misadventures. Oh, watch out, they have to jump-start Doc's time-machine Delorean (in earlier drafts it was a refrigerator) just in the knick of time as lightning strikes the clock tower in the town square. This movie basically demands that you watch it in your pajamas while eating cereal. The production, direction, and pace are all fine. Michael J. Fox is hilariously bad and Christopher Lloyd is clearly having fun in his over-the-top madcap role. It's a serviceable diversion, but the problem with pop-culture is that it's elevated this movie way too far above its lot.",

To my surprise I found it quite entertaining, even despite the absurdity of it all, and how corny it actually is. I even began sensing a similarity to Its A Wonderful Life, if not exactly in its plot, certainly in its warm hearted fantasy, and its use of time alteration, as the means of conveying a story. Unfortunately, I found the ending a little too drawn out. It seemed to attempt too much, and would have been better off with less ambition. Instead, it seems rather sloppy.

Something goes wrong and somehow Marty alters time and possibly destroy his future life.",
447,21 May 2002,SMLA11,10, Awesome movie,"This movie has everything, romance, action, and, best of all, science.It's a movie for everyone. Especially the people who don't like science fiction, because they'll learn to like it. It's great, the geek gets the girl, the bully is taken down, there's a crazy doctor and the kid fixes his parents' past. It's pretty amazing. The characters themselves were true to the setting and represented the 1980's and the 1950's perfectly. The DeLorean was the coolest time machine ever. If I learned anything from this movie, it's that you have to ride in style. It had a great plot, good camera work, some scientific accuracy, and a smooth ending. While I loved all of those things, there are a few things I would change. There were a few questions that weren't answered. What happened between 1955 and 1985 that made things the way they are? There are too many things that happened in those thirty years that weren't explained. Biff, George, and Loraine still had lives and their stories weren't explained. And then, on top of that, unless you see ""Back to the Future Part II"", the ending is just a huge cliffhanger. Why does the DeLorean suddenly fly? Who what's wrong with Marty's kids? What does Doc mean ""Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads!""? I guess ending it that way was a good move because then, you want to see Part II, you NEED to see Part II, or else you'll be left with a million questions that are left unanswered. It was the greatest, strangest, and most confusing two minutes of the entire movie, but that's what makes it so great. All in all, it was a great movie and definitely a science-fiction classic. I loved and I would recommend this movie to every one. If you're not a science-fiction fan, you will be, after experiencing the magic of ""Back to the Future"".",
448,1 December 2014,makayla4401,8," If you're not a sci-fi fan, you will be","I don't really see this movie as science fiction at all. Science fantasy, maybe. How does this time machine work? Marty asks. Well it's the good old flux capacitor, Dr. Brown ""explains."" In the original ""Time Machine"" movie, scientific explanations are even lamer. How does it work? Push the lever forward you go into the future; push it back and you go into the past! Why, thank you! It's perfectly clear now. No, no. There is no real science in ""Back to the Future."" The technological premise is a mere excuse to ruminate on the vicissitudes of fate and the possibility of doing something very difficult but crucial: changing your history. Marty learns that, maybe--just maybe--if you go beyond yourself and do something beyond what you think you can, beyond what you have seemingly been set up by fate to do, then you can change history--fate--not only for your self but for others as well, for your progeny, your family. Thus the real hero of this morality tale is not Marty but the old man. With Marty's help, he eventually stands up to Biff, something he never did the first time around and everything changes! The family is now hip and smart, classy, loving and cool! When I first saw that last scene (and when I still see it today), a tear of humanistic joy comes to my eye. The whole family is redeemed for at least a generation, because George learns a Hemingway lesson: a coward dies a thousand deaths, but a brave man only one. If Biff had killed him in the parking lot, then, at least, it would have been ""The Short, Happy Life of George McFly."" Sweet, sweet, sweet redemption. I love it!",

451,15 December 2015,kyle_dever,10, Incredible,"The secret of Back To The Future is its madcap pace. Any film about time travel must be like that, because any pause will expose the implausibility of it all, and that’s disastrous. The first Terminator couldn’t afford to stop anywhere because if it did the plot becomes laughable. Non-stop action is easier to handle than comedy, because with comedy you are always mired in the time-travel ramifications, instead of side-stepping it as they do in an action flick. It’s even more difficult for Back To The Future because it takes those ramifications head on. The hero has to save himself from non-existence after he has accidentally stopped his parents from meeting each other. So it’s not just pace that makes this film work, but also ingenuity. The plot is devilishly ingenious, and ingenuity keeps popping up in other forms too throughout the film, in cross-cultural references, in incestuous asides, in time travel in-jokes etc. it’s all helped by perfect casting and great performances, particularly Christopher Lloyd as the mad scientist Doc Brown, also good were Michael J. Fox, Lea Thomson and Crispin Glover. The cinematography is excellent too. Walking back in time appears palpable. The ending is lame, however. There was no need to have a significantly altered present when Marty comes back home. The whole point was not to change the present, so the film loses a lot of credibility here. But it doesn’t take away from the joyous ride of the last 2 hours. This film became one of the most popular films of all time, and it’s on the strength of its quality alone.",
452,21 October 2010,s_daad,8, The definitive time travel adventure,"The hero of the film is named Marty McFly, though his mother insists, when he ventures back in time 30 years, on calling him Calvin Klein. The film's observation that, in those days, a name sewn onto the back of one's pants was probably one's own is only one of the shrewd, rueful contrasts it draws between 1955 and the present day. Once Marty (played winningly by Michael J. Fox) steps into the specially equipped DeLorean owned by a mad scientist friend of his and floors the accelerator, he finds himself in a much simpler world. The neighborhood where he will someday live hasn't even been built. The local soda jerk thinks anyone who orders a Pepsi Free (''If you want a Pepsi you gotta pay for it!'') is being a wise guy. The town's movie theater is playing a Ronald Reagan film, and when Marty announces that Mr. Reagan will be President some day, he is met with a stare of disbelief and a sarcastic remark about Vice President Jerry Lewis. One of the things all teenagers believe is that their parents were never teenagers. Their parents were, perhaps, children once. They are undeniably adults now. but how could they have ever been teenagers, and yet not understand their own children? This teenagers by being one. But ""Back to the Future"" is even more hopeful: It argues that you can travel back in time to the years when your parents were teenagers, and straighten them out right at the moment when they needed help the most. Great movie!!! Absolutely to watch!",

Fox is accidentally sent 30 years back in time, he needs to make sure his teenage parents fall in love in order to save his own existence. When you go back in time where you were not supposed to be at all, you actions can change the course of your own future. This concept creates lot of hilarious situations and full credit goes to writer-director Robert Zemeckis and his team for consistently imaginative screenplay, excellent music and back ground score, witty dialogs and emotional connect between characters. All supporting actors have done a pretty decent job especially Christopher Lloyd playing the crazy scientist and Crispin Glover playing Marty's timid father. Don't miss this cult sci-fi classic.

The second part was very good too and I loved the laces coming long ago, yet it is mainly small but still enjoy the movie when I hear or see a good bit of Power Of Love Music. However, the third part. Infolog should then was good but unfortunately he became weak and boring in my opinion. If you do not want to have to get more money out of scratch it then do not go straight for one year it was sold out of the third one. But even which well animated movie beats. What is the worth of a good animation is a good CGI is an action movie when the story was rich does not tie up the man.

It was a huge hit in 1985 and I caught it on video soon after, it was the most entertaining and feel good movie I had seen up to that point. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd got the roles of their life in this film and Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson are great too. The whole time travel concept is brilliantly realised, the great thing about time travel is that it gives the film-makers many oppurtunities to insert some clever in jokes into the movie and they do that a lot in BTTF. They promised follow up at the end of the movie arrived four years later, which interestingly was filmed at the same time as Part III.

Practically every movie set for release in the summer had Blockbuster written all over it, and many of them ended up becoming franchises with sequels and product promotion, ultimately becoming collectors items not only for toys and gadgets sold in the stores, but video tapes and later video discs. Some of them have even ended up being adapted for the stage, and indeed, ""Back to the Future"" would ultimately become a musical spectacular.",

By that I mean that you can test the logic defined by the rules set in the film, and it stands up from all angles. Most time travel movies break their rules somewhere. Sometimes it's forgivable, sometimes it's not. But Back to the Future (and its sequels) is as close as I've seen to the perfect logic in a time travel movie. The writers clearly thought this through from all aspects. They defined the rules of time travel that they were going to use (of which there are several to choose from) and they wrote the story around those rules, rather than just making a time travel movie and not thinking through the ramifications of what the characters do.",
477,25 March 2007,jdavidbakr,10, The time travel film that all time travel films are measured by,"When it comes to not only incredible storytelling yet a truly great example of what a film should be, this and the entire trilogy define an undeniably 'timeless' experience that are forever lasting. Few times does a story introduce characters the way in which this does while at the same time delicately setting up what will become larger plot points. At every turn, there's another little surprise that lures the viewer in more and more. I think what's most profound here as opposed to other films similar to the genre is that although it's about time travel, it's moreover about people and relationships over anything else. Somehow, the writers prevent the story from getting bogged down in technical jargon and instead have smartly allowed the story of these characters to be present above all else. In summation, constantly entertaining and forever remarkable.",
478,26 April 2016,adammblutt,10, Perfection,"I know I've seen this movie before but I couldn't remember when or what happened. I kept getting it confused with Flight of the Navigator, a very similar movie in which a 12 year old boy disappears for eight years and suddenly comes back having not aged at all. Set in very similar time periods, it was easy to get them confused. Both are about time travel. One goes to the past and almost messes up history. One goes to the future after being gone for an extended period of time. Neither character look like they've aged. Marty is only in the past for a week, so you can't really age that much anyway.
When Marty McFly travels back in time to 1955 and spends that week with inventor Dr Emmett Brown who he knew in 1985. When Marty saves his father's life and gets hit by his grandfather's car, he has to figure out a way to get his parents together so that he'll still exist in the future. His father, once a poor businessman who gets bullied by his boss, becomes a wealthy author whose childhood bully becomes an employee and has to wax his cars.
After reading some of the Goofs on this site, I learned that there were quite a few historical errors, mostly relating to when a particular thing was first introduced to society. Silly things like a Pepsi thermometer in the soda shop that wasn't introduced to society until a couple years later. Or the type on a poster that wasn't around that year. Or the vibrato thing on Marty's guitar when he's playing at the dance. I've seen Flight of the Navigator a movie that takes place in 1986, a little more than a year after this movie.
Christopher Lloyd as an actor is awesome. He's played many roles in many different movies and TV shows. He voices the Hacker in the children's series Cyberchase. He's the criminal guy in Dennis the Menace. He plays as Doctor Emmett Brown in all the Back to the Future movies. He's the professor in the second season of the BYUtv series Granite Flats. He voices Rasputin in Disney's version of Anastasia. Those are just the movies and tv shows I can think of off the top of my head. How many movies has this guy played in? He plays all of his roles beautifully and I would definitely watch other movies that he's in. He's a great actor. He seems to get a lot of roles for villains and crazy old people, but he plays them well.",

There were some cheesy sci-fi moves, a lot of teen movies(the most popular ones were made by John Hughes), there were movies made specifically for the special effects, and there were plenty of raunchy comedies like the classic Risky Business and Revenge of the Nerds. During the time of its release, many movie companies weren't predicting Back To The Future to do as well since it didn't have anything raunchy in it, and it was different from a lot of other movies.

It starts off when Marty McFly gets into a lot of trouble. Including with his girlfriend and school (are you surprised?!). But then Marty realizes, his best friend, a scientist who he calls 'doc', just invented a time machine... and guess what? It actually works! But then something happens. When he is about to go to the year 1955, doc is shot by Libyain terrorists from whom he stole plutonium, the liquid that makes the time machine work. Without any choices, Marty scrambles into the car and... finds himself in the year 1955. But the story doesn't end there. Marty accidentally stops his parents (who were teenagers then) from meeting and falling in love with each other, and puts his life at risk. Because if his parents never met, that means that they never had any children. And if Marty doesn't get to get his parents to meet each other.. it means that him and his brothers will simply disappear off the face of the earth. Also, Marty and the young doc encounter another problem. Marty needs to get back to the future, and he can't as plutonium was barely known in the 1950s. So how will he do it? See and find out! This movie is simply cool. Not only is it funny, it also has an excellent script and dialog. I like the cast and the characters and I also liked the set decoration. Nearly everything about this movie is good. However, you have to pay full attention at the start to understand what happens later. But that doesn't spoil it. Rating: 7.5/10",

This movie really makes you pay attention to detail and takes you into the realization that Marty is hanging out with his parents when they were kids, and they play off that whole not fitting in with the time with his clothes and making the film funny by talking about him, his family, and the future.

This, however, would only make Back To The Future a great film. What makes it a REALLY GREAT film, however, is the ""buddy film"" aspect, or the amazingly close friendship that Marty and Doc have.

Very memorable and unforgettable film that makes you wish time travel were real!","'Back To The Future (1985)' might just be my favourite film of all time. It's an absolute classic, endlessly rewatchable and utterly brilliant. Its story really is timeless, less focused upon its sci-fi concept than you might expect. Even though the past is recreated with a lavish contrast, the piece doesn't tend to revel in its part period setting. Instead, it keeps its focus firmly on its characters and the dilemma in which they find themselves. Marty and Doc are as iconic a pairing as there's ever been, each written to perfection and performed just as well. Fox is fittingly flustered, as relatable as you can get, and Lloyd is like a living cartoon, lighting up the screen whenever he appears. The rest of the cast are all great, too; almost everyone has a distinct and memorable personality. After a lengthy but necessary set up, the flick absolutely flies by. Its amazing finale is comprised of a series of satisfying climaxes; everything pays off in some major way. The affair is incredibly efficient in that regard, as it only shows things that are vital to the story. It squeezes as much tension from its set-pieces as possible - I mean, I still squirm with suspense during its clock-tower clambering sequence even after a dozen viewings. The movie is phenomenally well-made in general. Frankly, it's a masterpiece. It puts a big, beaming smile on my face and keeps it there right through to the end of its credits.

But what makes this movie special is, that it seems to have aged a lot less than the other movies of its time - which is a tremendous achievement keeping in mind that this movie somewhat ""boasted"" with its time-travel special effects. The trick is, effects shouldn't manipulate the movie. Zemeckis was a genius ahead of his time, too many directors haven't learnt this lesson even yet. Why don't they make movies LIKE THIS anymore? Just set a likeable character (college kids seem to work well) in a predicemen, and let him work and stumble - the balance is essential; needs to be comedic, but not a farce - his way out of it through a 1000 minor and major situations and setbacks. All right, this guy ""grows up to be"" an unlikely hero, but do NOT reward him too much in the end (yeah, yeah, ""rolemodels for the kids"", blah blah. There is a surplus of ""educational"" movies, no need to to be ramming it down everybodys' throats every possible chance!). And do NOT forget the darker issues, even a little grown-up material.

In case you're one of the few people that have been living in 1955 all your life and have only just arrived in our year courtesy of a time machine, you may need to know that 'Back to the Future' is about time travelling. Marty McFly, played by the ever youthful Michael J Fox, gets caught up in eccentric inventor, Doc Brown's, latest scheme to build a time machine out of a DeLorean car. Naturally, things don't go smoothly as he inadvertently ends up in 1955 and accidentally interferes with the very moment his parents got together, therefore possibly preventing him from every being conceived.

Just something I thought I should mention. Anyway, for the movie. Marty McFly is the first character you see (well his feet). He hooks a guitar up to an app and blow's him away. Then he get's a call from the Doc telling him about his new invention. Even if you only know the plot and this is your first time watching the movie, you basically know what the invention is. You get some back story about Marty, his family and his town, Hill Valley. When you get to see Doc, you sorta know what's coming next. But then he get's killed by terrorists who chase Marty around the JC Penny's parking lot. After that where in 1955. You get to see George McFly in Lou's café and I will let you see the rest.

The story is a bit hackneyed, but we forgive the plot because the characters are entertaining. The ridiculous situations cooked up by the writers work in some instances, and not in others; it is a bit uneven.

513,19 January 2006,hdsink,10," Hold onto your seats, your going for a ride!","Seriously, I haven't written a review on this film. Well I better watch it again and rectify that. I love this film, it is literally a classic from the Eighties. In fact not only is it a classic from the Eighties, and takes me back to my childhood, but it also takes our parents back to their childhood by going back in time to 1955. Okay, this film does have the potential to mess with your head, but it is still great.
 I'm not sure if I even need to run through the synopsis since I assume that everybody actually knows the plot, but then again I'm sure there are people that have basically been living in a rabbit hole who may not know anything about this film. Basically, it is about a teenage kid, Marty McFly (Micheal J Fox) who watches his friend the Mad Scientist Doc Brown get killed by Libyan terrorists (namely because they gave him some plutonium to build a bomb and instead he uses it to power the time machine) and to escape them Marty jumps into the DeLorean and inadvertently goes back in time to 1955.
 Well, you have to admit that that DeLorean is just so cool. In fact, this film is so much apart of our collective consciousness that I actually wonder whether anybody can look at a DeLorean and think of a time machine. Actually, I wonder if anybody actually went out and purchased a DeLorean with the hope that if they drove up to 88 mph they would end up going back in time? Then again, I suspect that there are some authorities that may have had a thing or two so say about that.
 Actually, there are a couple of things that baffle me, including the fact that when Marty got back to 1985 he pretty much leaves the DeLorean unlocked and parked in the middle of the road. I'm sure that there would have been people who may have wanted to take a free DeLorean with them. Then again, if it wasn't running at the time then it probably isn't much of an issue. However, at least he was smart enough to hide the DeLorean behind some bushes when he was in 1955, though there is always the suggestion that things were a lot safer, and crime a lot less back them.
 However, Hill Valley in 1985 really didn't seem to be one of those places that would be all that fun to live in. You know, the town square looks pretty shocking, and it is interesting that the old cinema has been turned into a church. Then again, a lot of churches meet in cinemas - it sort of works rather well, and the sound is also pretty good, or at least the wiring. However, I also noticed that the place next door was an adults only entertainment complex - right next to a church. Gee, I'm sure the church is happy about that.
 This is basically one of those lets go back in time and change everything, inadvertently of course, so that the rather dreary life back home actually becomes quite good, even if it really came down to a single punch. Then again, Biff Tanner really did have it coming to him, and it clearly goes to show that the guy is all talk and no action. Well not quite, but it is quite convenient that they moved all of his thugs away just as George McFly inadvertently came up to the car, expecting Marty to be in there. Of course, punching Biff really does a lot to George's self esteem.
 Oh, and then there is the principle, going around calling everybody slackers. I'm sure there is a law against that. Oh, that's right, it's 1985 and teachers could get away with demonising students. Then again, what did George do wrong? Why had he earnt the enmity of the headmaster? This guy certainly seems to have it in for him, or was it that he pretty much had it in for all of his students. Surely he knew what Biff was like anyway. Actually, the interesting thing is how the guy never actually seems to age. Okay, Marty does comment on the fact that he has never had any hair, but still, we can't quite fault the movie for having the principle look the same. However what was it, thirty years in the same job. That's literally his entire career.
 Oh, and there is another thing that I find somewhat curious. If Doc Brown is now aware that he sends Marty back in time, where does Marty go when he flees the Libyan terrorists. Honestly, I wonder if Doc Brown actually realises that the time line has already been changed with Marty going back the first time, so if Marty goes back a second time, it isn't as if he is going to keep the timeline consistent. In fact the second Marty who goes back is likely to make some more changes, and inevitably he is going to muck up the time line even more. As I come to think of it, it seems as if Doc Brown doesn't fully understand the fifth dimension, so most likely he will set the timer to the exact time that Marty comes back, which will mean that there will be two DeLoreans arriving at the same time, and Marty will meet, well, Marty.
 Anyway, this is a great movie, and it certainly brings back a lot of childhood memories. Actually, I have no idea how many times I have watched this, though I will have to say that the guy that walks around wearing 3D glasses looks pretty cool, even if he happens to be one of Biff's thugs. Then again, they do eventually get whats coming for them when they end up picking on the wrong people.",
514,24 June 2018,The-Sarkologist,9, A Childhood Classic,"Back to the Future is one of the time travel movies that does things right. The story of the film is basically Marty Mcfly(played by Michael J.Fox) is living in 1985 and his friend Doc Brown(played by Christopher Lloyd) ,who is a mad scientist shows off his new invention: the time machine. Something crazy happens that causes Marty to go back to 1955 in Doc's time machine and is stuck in 1955, and to make matters worse, the time machine is broken! On top of that, he stupidly alters his future and prevents HIS OWN BIRTH! Crazy huh? But, its up to Marty and Doc(played by Christopher Lloyd) to not only get Marty back to his present time, but to also fix the wrongs he has caused to his future! I will not spoil this movie because you must go see this magnificent piece of film-making! The performances in this movie were all fantastic! Especially the best villain in that movie: Biff. He is a mean bully that picks on everyone and has the most hilarious lines in this movie!""Well look at what we have here."" Robert Zemeckis did a superb job in establishing the characters and the plot-line.Not to mention, its a blend of other genres besides time-travel. There is romance, high school, sci-fi and action all in one movie!WOW! Hoow did they manage to do that you may ask? Well, it just works because the script cleverly sets the movie up. Plus, the story runs very smoothly during transitions of scenes. Usually, when time travel is involved as a premise to a story, it would fall completely apart. But, thankfully they didn't do that! The story is actually not as complicated as people think. But, it does make your head spin of all the things going on in the movie! Its very consistent on switching to those scenes. Plus, the special effects were jaw-dropping back in the 80's but today it kind of looks outdated. However, this film has a charm that makes this film a spectacle in the time-travel genre. Now, what I liked about this film was the way the story was presented and the hilarious interactions between the characters:""Oh what are you looking at butt head?"" Oh and the special effects! ""If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 mph, you're gonna see some serious s**t!"" See I'm already quoting the movie, thats how good it is! That line always makes me think of BTF so much! But anyway, there is really nothing wrong with this film. Now, its not my favorite of the series.(OMG HOW DARE HE! HOW DARE HE SAY BTF IS NOT HIS FAVORITE!!!! TROLOLOLOLOLOLOOLOLOLOLLOL) Yes, it is not my favorite IN MY OPINION! However, this is a fantastic piece of work from Robert Zemeckis! As Doc Brown says:""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."" I have lived with that quote in my head in my entire life to never give up on what you fight for! Overall, I think this is a fantastic film in the time-travel genre and deserves to be on the IMDb Top 250 List! ""So, why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here!""",

516,5 June 2020,cruise01,9, A lot of fun,"This is one of those movies, you can watch anytime! It's funny the first time, it's even funnier the second time, and the third time it's still very funny, but you notice the small details in the movie. Examples: In the first movie, when Marty goes to see the Time machine for the first time, he drives (on a skateboard) by a sign that says ""Twin pine mall"". When he escapes from Old Man Peabody in the car, he hits on of Peabody's Pines, (there where 2 of them) - and when we see the mall later on in the film (when he has come back to the future), the sign says ""Single Pine Mall"" Another is in third movie. At first the ravine is called ""Shonash Ravine"", and in the future (before Doc and Marty arrived) it's called Clayton Ravine, because Clara Clayton should have fallen in it. But because they save Clayton and Marty, who's known as Clint Eastwood back then, falls in it instead. Well of course he does not fall in, it's just the train, but Doc must have said to the people in Hill Valley, as an excuse. So they name the Ravine after Clint Eastwood (Marty), so it's called Eastwood Ravine. And there's a lot of these funny small things in the movies, and that's just a fraction of the reason why this film is one of the best ever made!",

Things like unrealistic decisions by the characters are plentiful all throughout the movie, which spoils the immersion quite a bit. The acting also isn't great and several scenes had me cringing at the voice lines. The implementation of time-travel and the 'butterfly effect' that the time-travel has which is shown in the movie is also flawed and unrealistic, though they undoubtedly chose this flawed version of time-travel in order to create some false drama and suspense, so I guess it can be somewhat excused. The movie also has little-to-no humor or comedy in it... I didn't laugh a single time throughout the entire movie, and it's not like comedy movies from the 1980's can't make me laugh, in-fact, I laughed several times at 'Good morning Vietnam' and 'Airplane!' and 'Police Academy' and 'Ghostbusters', so it's really just that 'Back to the Future' has no discernible comedy in it to be honest.",

546,5 March 2014,Just-Being-Me,9, A must see.,"Time travel movies make people have headaches, so Robert Zemeckis wisely added another layer to his movie, Back To the Future. The central question of Back To the Future is not what would it be like to go back in time, but rather, a bigger question: ""What were my parents like as teenagers?"" As teenagers, we always heard our parents give us rules about what we could and could not do, and we never thought maybe our parents were telling us what not to do because they did that stupid stuff themselves, we just assumed they always knew best. But what would it really be like to see what kind of awful things our parents did while young. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), for better or for worse, finds out in Back To the Future. While trying to outrun Libyan terrorists in a modified DeLorian, McFly is transported back to October 27, 1955, 30 years in the past for this 1985 film. Doc Brown (a manic Christopher Lloyd) invents the process to time travel and put it all together in the DeLorian, and is a young scientist when McFly looks him up in 1955. Not believing the story of ""Future Boy,"" especially after he says Ronald Reagan was president in 1985, but is eventually convinced and tries to help the young man out. While trying to get back to 1985, McFly accidentally ruins the moment that his father (Crispin Glover) meets his mother (Lea Thompson), possibly ending his own life. Parents don't meet, they don't have babies, and don't have Marty. Worse, Marty's mother starts to fall for him, so he needs to get his father and mother back together. Seeing his parents back in their teenage days is enlightening and will serve as a surprise at the end of the movie. There are several jokes about time and space, how Twin Pines Mall becomes Single Pine Mall is amusing and other changes to the town from the beginning of the movie to the end is interesting. But most of all, what would your parents to be like if you visited them 30 years ago? A great question, though do you really want it answered?",

The young Doc's incredulity on hearing of actor Ronald Reagan's next job – ""Who's Vice-President? Jerry Lewis?"" – spoke for the world, and Marty's means of returning to 1985 is a stroke of narrative genius. Scheduling clashes very nearly led to Marty's being played by Eric Stoltz, but (with all respect to the very capable Stoltz) thank heavens a solution was found, as the film would have been immeasurably the poorer without Fox's uniquely energetic charm. It's particularly cruel that so physically nimble a performer should since have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, but he continues to approach it with a hero's grace and humour, and has become a major figure in increasing awareness for the disease.",

I have yet to see such a brilliant and clever script since. Examples are: Marty's mom berating the behavior she herself was guilty of as a teenager; Marty creating a makeshift skateboard, which he is shown to be very adept at riding in the present, out of an old time scooter in 1955; George Mcfly punching out Biff turns George into a confident, successful writer and Biff into a stumbling oaf; and, of course, Marty inventing rock n roll.

646,13 July 2020,baileycrawly,9, What's Not to Love?,"This has got to be one of the coolest movies ever made and the pinnacle of 80's popcorn cinema! High school teenager Marty McFly is sent back to 1955 through a DeLorean time machine invented by his friend, nutty scientist Doc Emmett Brown. Once there, he inadvertently changes the course of time. He must now do everything he can in order to bring his parents back together or he and his siblings will be erased from existence. He must also fight off school bully Biff Tannen and ultimately get back to the future. Director and co-writer Robert Zemeckis gives us pure solid entertainment with excellent pacing, likable characters, and a cleverly-written screenplay. The special effects are also exceptional. Twenty years later, they still look fresh and new. Zemeckis also succeeds in bringing to life an idealized and nostalgic 1950's look. Furthermore, the movie is filled with great performances. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are superb and have great chemistry together. Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, and Thomas F. Wilson are also splendid in their underrated performances. Alan Silvetri's musical score and a couple of songs from Huey Lewis and the News are also enjoyable and serve their purpose to heighten the excitement. This is such a great movie for people of all ages. It personally holds a special place in my heart because of the fond memories it brings. I've seen it countless times since I was a kid and it never gets tiring. A must see for all!",

I don't really like sci-fi films but this appeals to people on so many levels and genres that things like that don't really matter. Christopher Lloyd plays Doc Brown to absolute perfection when he swans around as if conducting an orchestra. Michael J Fox is the star of the movie but the supporting roles are cast so well that all of the characters are stars in their own right. I particularly like Thomas F Wilson as Biff and the way that he gets more manic and vicious as the trilogy unfolds. The combination of excellent special effects, brilliant directing and the true skill of the actors means that this is one of the few mainstream cult classics. It's a film for the whole family without being patronising or babyish. Ace!",

It doesn't take long before Marty finds him self traveling from 1985 back to the 1950. Marty's adventure to get back to his time is entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The film is also very humorous. Throughout the whole film it never really seems to drag except for one point in the middle.,

The problem is that the mom and the dad are not getting married. They are actors.The special effects are awesome. I recommend it for 6 or more years old. There are 3 parts 1st Marty goes to the past second they both go to the future. On the third part they go to the past. My favorite part was when Marty uses photo to see how much time they have together as a family.the good thing is it is easy to make predichens about the next part. It is 100% awesome.,

652,3 November 2020,noelhernandez,10, One of my favorite trilogies of all time.,"July 3rd, 1985.  My all time fave is released and although I know most everybody knows about the film, I must recap it one more time.  Fox is Marty McFly, a cool, confident teen who plays a mean guitar, rides a skateboard like nobodys business, and has a sweet, pretty girlfriend.  One night in a mall parking lot his life is disrupted while helping his older friend, Dr. Brown (Lloyd, in a truly memorable performance).  The Doc is gunned down and Martys only escape from his own demise is to take off in Lloyds newly created time machine, an awesome looking DeLorean.  He ends up in 1955, when his parents were his age and oops, he interferes with their first meeting. And double oops, his mom has a crush on him!  Yuck!  The core of the film is his attempts to get them to fall for each other so that he'll exist in the future, while avoiding run-ins with a bully named Biff (what else?). The film is packed with one terrific scene after another; the skateboard chase, Johnny B. Goode, George standing up to Biff, the clocktower sequence, I could go on.  Two great songs from Huey Lewis and an exciting score from Alan Silvestri add to the films greatness.  Fox, replacing the fired Eric Stolz as Marty, is great, Lloyd is perfectly manic, Thompson is cute, Glover is a crack up, and Wilson's bully is right on target.  Two sequels followed, one in 89 one in 90, also an ok cartoon series and a lousy video game. Though most might not be with me that this is the best ever, youd be hard pressed to find anyone whod say this isnt one of the greats to come along.",

The only close competition for durability would be the Shawshank Redemption. This is one of those movies that I would see at the theater again, if they were to show it on the big screen!

I can understand its pioneering qualities, but now it seems dilluted, when put alongside other good works on same general topic. Spielberg had his magic, but after a while, got repetitive. Looking back, it seems clear that he tried to recapture the nostalgia of his childhood, the things those kids dreamt and imagined, which is fine in itself, but gets you only so far. The standard small town, people, relationships (popular kids, loner, bullying, lifelong archenemies) somehow feel museum like today. Without the drop of nostalgia, the movie is more like a framework of childish memories of times that are no longer and feels... Boring. A milestone, but one of a past that isn't connected to our days.",

The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time traveling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways.",

The actors were perfect for their roles... save maybe the girlfriend who was replaced in 2 and 3 (also very awesome.) The music was even better. Top notch. There are too many iconic moments to count in this movie. Tell me you cannot laugh when Fox says ""You made a time machine... out of a Delorean?!"" And Doc answers ""If you're gonna time travel, may as well do it in style."" I might be paraphrasing, but you get my point. Doc is absolutely hilarious and Christopher Lloyd plays him perfectly. I could never see a better team for this movie than Fox and Lloyd. Choose you side characters: Biff, George, the principal, they all scream perfect casting. The intro scenes are awesomely nerdy, hilarious, and thought out. And the ending...""Roads... where we're going, we don't need roads!"" leads well into the next movie. I am so glad they did a trilogy.",

This specific trilogy is proof that most sequels are always worse than the original (although the sequels of it are quite enjoyable but perform far from the ""classic status"" of the original).",
695,9 April 2005,lazarou789,10, A classic tale that everyone will like to live: to go back in time to live the time your parents met,I see Back to the Future has grossed $350 million. I wonder how much it would have made if I had directed it?,
696,27 July 2011,dimplet,8, Succeeds despite the over-acting,"Imagine if you could go back in time and meet your parents when they were the same age as you? What would you think of them? Would you hang out with them? What if the parent of the opposite sex developed a crush on you? This is the inspired premise behind a movie that will live on forever in my heart, the best film I have ever seen out of thousands of films. Back to the Future received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Screenplay and numerous technical awards. It was the biggest box office hit of 1985. None of that explains what makes the film so perfect. What makes it perfect is the way it hooks you with it's premise and then carries it out in a manner that will entertain and enlighten you. It's a film that expertly blends so many genres. It's a comedy, a drama, a rip roaring thrill ride, sci fi action adventure, and love story. No movie I've seen pulls off all these genres at the same time. The movie transports you back in time and teaches us how our lives are connected and the significance of your family roots. If you're an adult, you marvel at the recreation of the 50s and the knowing jokes, such as the disbelief of realizing that the actor Ronald Reagan was going to become president. As a child, you realize that yes, your parents were young once and they were even like you in many ways. These are just some of the issues the film deals with. You care about the characters and live through their strengths and flaws. It's hard to imagine anyone other than Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly but as fate would have it, he was the replacement for Eric Stoltz (a terrific actor who apparently was considered too intense for the role.)  This bold decision by the producers to scrap several weeks of filming and replace the lead actor was a risk that paid off beyond their wildest dreams. Fox dissolves into the role so easily that his acting talent sometimes gets overlooked because he makes it look so effortless. As for Christopher Lloyd, no need to replace him. This is the role he will always be remembered for. Who else could handle the rapid fire delivery and sheer energy that his Doc Brown called for? He has a lot of the best lines. Hats off to Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson, who each endured makeup allowing them to play 17 and 47. Their joy in playing these characters comes through. All the roles down to the smallest were wonderfully cast. The marvelous sets, costumes, editing, music, sound effects, etc. And of course, hats off to Director Robert Zemeckis, who went on to make Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Forrest Gump. This remains his masterpiece. He also did both of the good but inferior sequels. This is the movie to put into the time capsule (Delorean). Can't wait for the re-release.",

Fox does a fantastic job as Marty Mc.Fly. and Christopher Lloyd does a fantastic job as Doc. Brown. SPOILER ALERT: the plot is that Doc.Brown invented a time machine out of a car. he then gets shot. Marty then mistakenly goes back in time to 1955. he meets his father and mother. his mom falls in love with him instead of his father. now he has to get them to fall in love or else he won't exist. and he still needs to get back to his time. the theme song is fantastic. everything about this movie is fantastic. none of my friends saw it. so if you've been looking for a good sc-fi action comedy look no further. that's about all i have to say.,

This movie is rich in content, and we got to know a lot of different characters. I think the story was quite alright, and I appreciate when stories include time as a topic, which I think was well used in this one. Time travel is always interesting, and it rarely disappoints me. The story was kind of simple, but I think it was the interaction between the characters that made up for most of it. I think the actors were mostly good, but my attention goes to Crispin Glover (as George McFly). He played such a unique character, and his performance was great! This movie is definitely recommending!",

703,15 December 2013,sumitjindal07,10, the best trilogy ever,"It is said that the director originally wanted to shoot a scene of a nuclear explosion, the company did not give Monty, so the story can only be placed in a small town. There is no nuclear explosion, no laser sword, the director and screenwriter must only attract the audience from the details. Wearing ck underwear, the protagonists of the Nike canvas shoes returned to1995, and he simple changed his name to Calvin Klein, pretending to be an alien and scaring his dad to a dad to dance with this mother. Holding a Gibson casino guitar at the graduation ball of his parents and playing a Johnny bgoode, and finally came a fan brother's hands to string, making the 55-year high school students stunned, the protagonist said: your kids gonna love it. And the guitarist with an injured hand called his cousin chuck berry to let him listen to the song, and rock music was born.
Skateboard chasing this classic bridge must have originated from this movie. The protagonist was in the west in 1885, the director paid tribute to Clint Eastwood. I don't know if Fukuoka Fukui has seen this movie. The hero in Doraemon has also set a talent for precise shooting. I remember in a long story, Nobita also became a cowboy and rescued the beauty. When the person selling the Clot pistol asked the protagonist: Where did you learn this hand. Seven eleven convenience store, the protagonist replied. And we already know the protagonist's skills on the game console in 2015.
The first dog of the doctor was Copernicus, and the dog in 1985 was already Einstein. You can imagine how many dogs the doctor has raised. After reading it, I knew how much the movie Westward Journey and the 90s used to return to the future. Even if the classic sentence in Journey to the West is in heaven, I think it is not as good as that of the doctor: she is one of a million, one of a billion, one of a googleplex. She is my dream, and I lost her for all time.",
704,7 April 2020,krational66,8, Classic sections and details.,"""Back to the Future"" is one of my all-time favorite films. It is one that the whole family can sit down and watch, but isn't one of those stupid childish animations that comes under ""family"" but is actually just for kids 2-8. It is one of the few films I never get tired of watching, and by now I must have seen it at least 50 times (no joke!). I've never gotten tired of this film as it is so original in the way it is presented. I've never seen another film where a DeLorean is a time machine, or one where a son is hit on by his mother for that matter... Anyway, this film is timeless, as it is so funny, clever, and you never know what is coming round the corner. The film is based in 1955, although it does start off in 1985. Marty McFly, one of the main characters, travels back in time and runs into his parents (George and Loraine), which starts off the whole story, involving a time machine, some messing with history, and pretty awesome music.

708,1 December 2011,werdreuab317,10, Words can not Describe.,"'Back to the Future' was hugely successful, mainly with teens and mainly because it ties in to their hang-ups, angst, and fantasies. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) deals with them all as teens only wish they could, jumping on a skateboard when things get too sticky, outsmarting the bully, and zipping through time in a REALLY souped-up Delorean. Fox doesn't so much act as hyperventilate his way through the film; he is constantly on the move, frenetic and frantic, forever running to or from one thing or the other, and shouting ""Doc!"" a lot. His energy level is admirable, even though I got tired just watching him. This is precisely what teenagers, particularly teen boys, empathize with so deeply in this movie. The best solution to any problem is to not stand still. Run like hell and maybe something will come to you. The film's script is clever and in keeping with Fox's performance, really over-the-top and unashamedly silly at times. With the help of Christopher Lloyd's goofily eccentric Doc Brown, he travels back in time to 1955 and meets his own parents, before they were married. There are a number of nifty twists and turns in the time-travel plot, and the other characters are very well-cast. Crispin Glover does a great job as Marty's dim-bulb father George as does Lea Thompson, portraying Lorraine, his mother. Lorraine develops a crush on Marty back in the '50s (obviously not knowing who he is, or will be) and one of several problems Marty faces is making sure that she and George end up together. Glover and Thompson, along with Thomas F. Wilson as Biff, the bully, actually outshine Fox's breathless portrayal and Lloyd's incessant mugging. The gags and situations are sometimes obvious but have a good batting average; upon learning from Marty that the president in 1985 is Ronald Reagan, the 1955 Doc Brown says, quite understandably, ""Ronald Reagan? The actor? Who's the vice-president... Jerry Lewis?"" There is also an entertaining sequence at a high school dance where Marty and a back-up band perform a freaked-out, almost 'metal' version of 'Johnny B. Goode.' The film even takes it a step further, having Marvin Berry (Chuck's cousin) call him in the middle of the performance to let him listen, making the almost blasphemous suggestion that this is what gave Chuck Berry the impetus to create rock and roll! 'Back to the Future' is so good-natured, though, that it gets away with this as well as Lorraine's flirtation with Marty. Fox and the film are sufficiently likable that it all seems harmless, which it is. Two popular sequels followed, but they lack the charm and upbeat feeling of the first movie, a frenzied fun-ride through time.",
709,16 April 2008,HelloTexas11,7, fast blast back to the '50s,"Back To The Future (1985) The comedy, action and sci-fi classic that is, Back to the Future (1985, starring Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson. Is about a young high school student, named Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), living in Hill Valley, who is friends with the, genius with a little bit of crazy, scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who to travels back from the year 1985, to November 5th 1955, in a time travelling DeLorean. He gets stuck in 1955 and runs into his future parents when they were in high school, the only way for Marty to find a way back to 1985 is with the help of his friend Dr. Brown. First thing that came to my mind after I had watched the movie was the fact that the whole McFly family's lives got better after the crazy adventure Marty had been through in 1955. In the beginning you see how Biff (Wilson), basically bullies and dominates over, Marty's father, George (Glover). Then when Marty goes back to the future he tries to encourage his father to stand up for himself and ask Marty's mother, Lorraine (Thompson), out, even though she's in love with Marty. In the end Marty and George make a plan to make her fall in love with George instead of Marty. The plan is that Marty parks with Lorraine, he argues with her, then George comes and ""fights"" Marty to show that he can stand up for himself. Then it ends up by Biff being in the car grabbing Lorraine and trying to seduce her, while Marty is carried away, then George goes to the car opens up the door, and gets two options, either he really stands up for himself and saves Lorraine from Biff, or he just walks away like nothing happened. George chooses to stand up for Lorraine, and punches Biff in the face and he goes right down on the ground. This broke the whole pattern that had lead George to get held back by bad self-confidence and spent time doing Biff's homework for him and being bullied by him. So not only does personal life and his children's lives get improved, by them getting better jobs, but also his career takes off and he publishes a book on science fiction stories that he's been writing since high school.",

This paradox is a supposed impediment for time travel: If a young man goes back in time and makes his grandmother fall in love, then, his grandfather cannot marry her, therefore, his father is never born and he is never born and can never go back in time to make his grandmother fall in love with him.

One of those where not only can't you imagine changing a single significant actor, but you can't imagine changing a single scene or (almost) a line of dialogue. It also provides a good lesson about what science fiction should and shouldn't do, a lesson that its painful sequels fail. The original is about the characters and the times. The (absurdist) time-travel mechanism is a memorable device, and its inventiveness certainly contributes to the film's greatness. But the sci-fi takes a back seat to the things we really care about: Marty adjusting to 1955, George's self esteem, Marty's relationship with Doc. In the sequels, we get a whole lot of junk about the metaphysics of time (which as a philosopher I instinctively pick apart), but all of the new characters feel like props, and I don't really care what happens to anyone.  This is a classic example of sequels profaning an original.  ""Part I"": 10/10.  II and III, 3/10.",

Fox delivers what is quite possibly one of his best performances ever, as well as Christopher Llyod. (who I believe deserved an Oscar nomination) The Script is highly original and inventive making the most of its time travel related story.

Lloyd is perfect as Doc, and Wilson's Biff is one of the great villains that mixes gormlessness with genuine menace. Glover nearly steals the film, and his absence in the two sequels is sorely missed upon rewatching the original. But this is Fox's film. He is so effortlessly charming and funny (and convincingly tough for a man of his stature) that he dominates every scene among hugely talented character actors. Make no mistake, this guy was a superstar and BTTF launched his career 10/10.",

727,4 April 2022,dkgupta493,10, Movie is more than perfect,"Robert Zemeckis is one of the better directors out there, and you can say what you want to about the movies he has done, but ""Back to the Future"" was his most memorable. This movie was done with style, and will always be the best sci-fi movie around. The acting is remarkable; Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) are the standouts in the film. Fox does a wonderful job portraying the average 80s teenager, while Lloyd made his voice heard in his career best performance. As for Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson, they add another ring to the story, and give it comedy, a rare occurance in science fiction. There are several things that I could note telling how good this movie was. The concept of traveling through time has never exactly done well in the theatres before, but ""Back to the Future"" worked, as did its sequels. The small things also made this movie what it is today, like how realistic the 1950s were. During those scenes, you can imagine it being a 50s movie done in color. Also, the usage of the Delorean seemed like the perfect car for the time machine. To sum things up, I quote Doc, talking about the Delorean used for the time machine. ""If you're gonna make a time machine, why not do it with some style?"" And that's exactly how Zemeckis made this fantastic movie, with style.",

739,9 August 2013,TheResponderUno,10, The greatest film of all time,"Synchronize your watches! If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 mph, you're gonna see some serious s***. Directed & written by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Steven Spielberg, this movie will forever remind me of what good-feel movie is supposed to be. The movie is about a teenager from 1985, Marty McFly (Micheal J. Fox) whom is sent back in time to 1955. While he was there, he meets his future parents in high school and accidentally becomes his mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson)'s romantic interest, causing a time-rip. Marty must repair the damage to history by trying to get his parents to fall in love, and with the help of scientists Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd), while, also finding a way to return to 1985. I love the fish-out-of-water history time-travel comedy, with the high-skates action scenes. It was very entertaining. I love how the film has its running gags, and inside jokes of historical pop culture events; of Robert Zemeckik's work, and what was happening in the 1980's at the time. The movie has everything for every audience member, at the time. While, most movies were risque and adult-aimed at the time; the movie balance it, enough to make it watchable for both family and single house-hold settings. Parents went to go see it for nostalgia reasons. While the movie is mostly set in 1950's, it's truly a mark of the 1980's. I have to give the movie props with its controversial movie dilemma, with the relationship with his younger mother. In any other movie, this might be tasteless, and turn people off, but Back to the Future made it work. I can also buy that, teenager Marty McFly would be friends with an older mad scientist, Doc Brown without it being creepy. Both have this father/son relationship that I love for this film. High praise to Christopher Lloyd for creating this character for his own. I can't see, anybody besides him. The production was indeed challenging. There were some changes that help the film, a lot. First off, is the title of the film, the film was almost called, 'Spaceman from Pluto'. Gladly, somebody came to their senses, and went back to the title, Back to the Future. Another is that, Micheal J Fox was the best choice to play Marty McFly, but he was committed to the show Family Ties. So they hired Scott Stoltz. I wouldn't say, Eric Stoltz would be awful in the movie, but indeed, Micheal J Fox was the best choice for the film and they waited on production, until Fox's schedule opened up. The supporting cast is well-acted. Crispin Glover that played George McFly got all George's nerdy mannerisms, right. Lea Thompson is just amazing, and beautiful actress to play Lorraine. Thomas F. Wilson as the bully, Biff Tannen was just hilarious. Every scene with him, made the film, so much better. You'll love to hate him.",

Still, until that day arrives, we have Back to the Future to reminiscent off of.  Back to the Future was a great movie.  The teen style McFly mixed with a doc inventing everything from anything.  Going into the past was so cool.  Everyone wishes they could visit their heritage, so this movie did it for us.  Robert Zemeckis did a wonderful job on this flick.  My only con, is that they didn't explore more avenues.  For example, jumping into the Roman times, or even the Egyptian times.  Although, to be fair, they didn't actually get the chance according to the storyline, so it's really nobody's fault.  I gave this movie a rating of 9/10.",

744,18 February 2021,js-25331,8, It's good... BUT!!!!!!!!,"An 80's classic that still holds up tremendously well, Back to the Future is iconic from start to finish. This truly is a masterpiece in setup and payoff. Whilst some might find the exposition towards the beginning tiresome, it kept me engaged as I knew that the payoff was coming in the second half. The humour really is second to none, and the characters are genuinely great. They could have ended up being stereotypical, but they ended up working really well. The score is another fantastic element - it's one of the most iconic scores of all time. Michael J Fox is obviously iconic as Marty, and his delivery is really good aswell. The effects mostly hold up well, but they don't need to because of how strong the story is. It really is one of the most simple yet enjoyable films of all time. My only tiny gripe is the final scene with Doc Brown returning and taking them to the future. I think it restricted what they could do in the sequel, and feels quite tacked on and annoying. I know it is an iconic scene, I just don't think it really works at all. Still, this isn't a big enough issue for me to not give this the 5 star rating it thoroughly deserves. It's a truly timeless film (Get it? Because time travel) and I'd definitely recommend it.",

Back to the Future brings all the 80's kitsch and combines it with all the fantasy that you want out of a movie that makes you a happier person after watching it. The casting in this movie is iconic. I couldn't imagine Eric Stoltz as Marty McFly, because of Fox's performance, but now I would like to see it just to know. I truly think that BTTF can change people's lives and impact their outlooks.

753,14 October 2019,AKIFABUASSI,9, v good movie,"This is a fraud movie, the most effective one I know of; everyone in the '80s liked it. Spielberg said the ""studios weren't ready for Bob's movies, even though he was ready to make them"" or something (it's on Zemeckis's Wikipedia page), but really, I think this was a question of the Spielbergian élan that he can't confer to others but imagines (might be) there ... of all the follow-ups and rip-offs to 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' the Lucas Star Wars films, 'E. T.,' 'Close Encounters,' and 'Jaws', it's this one that sticks ... not ""Young Sherlock Holmes,"" ""Tales of the Gold Monkey,"" ""King Solomon's Mines,"" ""Battle Beyond the Stars,"" or Spielberg's own ""Amazing Stories"" and ""Twilight Zone"" revivals (I'm omitting ""Gremlins,"" but Joe Dante has a vision and style of his own, so bear with me). Zemeckis, later to give us ""Forrest Gump"" and having already given us ""Used Cars"" (not a hit, but considered a cult classic, and subversive) and ""Romancing the Stone"" (funnily enough, one of the biggest hits of the year and everyone was fond of it at the time, though it sticks in no-one's craw *now*; Kathleen Turner had trouble finding movie roles after 'Body Heat,' no-one wanted a husky-voiced Bacall like they wanted a sarcastic Jack Nicholson in Christian Slater, makes have it easier!), once said ""he never saw why people disparaged TV so much ... I learned a *lot* from TV!"" or something. (Which is where we get ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" which holds up badly now -- or at least weakly, like water dripping through a sieve. It's not just who cares about these characters now -- or, not to be unkind, but Bob Hoskins either, but let's get real -- but who cares about these *pretenses* now? WB cartoons may come up in ""The Shining"" but that's about it. I used to watch Saturday morning cartoons every week until I grew out of them, but I'm as little fond of them even as a memory as I am of sugar-coated breakfast cereals, which was supposed to make up for eggs and bacon, much less the breakfast scrambled everyone eats in Portland, where I live, now. I used to be Boba Fett and Yoda for Halloween, get me? Who *cares* about Saturday Morning Cartoons -- at least I *remember* those costumes, those experiences, etc.) Which -- the TV-watching I mean -- makes him like David Mamet. ""I grew up during the golden age of television!"" he says, or something close to it (I'm quoting from memory), in his relatively-recent book about realizing he's a ""conservative."" And David Mamet was considered one of the pre-eminent playwrights of our time, certainly when I was in college in the early '90s and Madonna's choosing to do ""Speed the Plow"" on Broadway was supposed to be significant and ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" was being made into an all-male, ""Reservoir Dogs""-like allstar combatant zone by the Jim Thompson adapter, ""After Dark, My Sweet's"" James Foley (still the only Mamet, aside from ""House of Games,"" worth seeing, and at that, only once -- who cares about ""Heist?"" He's too full of himself). Talk about high and low culture! All of a sudden it looks like we're being duped, because we're too shy to construct our own narratives, and can't tell people confident enough to string scenes together with sugary-coated TV motives and direct them into life from ""Love's Labor Lost."" I say phooey on this movie. All it teaches is contempt -- and you can tell this from the reviews on here, they're all replete with it. Crispin Glover was much better (and *memorable*!) in ""Wild at Heart"" (""I'm making my lunch!""). Who could forget *that*?",

One personal experience to this movie is sometimes I talk such long naps that I end up feeling like I slept through a couple of years. The filmmaker is telling you that you should be glad you didn't go to school with your parents. They are also telling you that when your mom is hitting on you things can get a little weird. I knew in this part if history that women wore dresses. I also new they didn't have super nice cars. Something that is similar to this time in history is that people are still super clingy in relationships. I have not seen movies by this director. I think this was a good movie. I wouldn't mind seeing other movies by these people. I think the actors did a really good job. I liked the camera angles they were different from what you normally see. I don't think this is a movie I would watch outside of school. If I were to recommend this movie to someone it would be to my parents.,

I don't want to tell too much of the storyline, (because if you haven't seen it yet, you really should) but it starts off with Marty McFly, a standard '80's teenager (the setting is 1985) with a goofy, nerdy dad, an alcoholic mom, a fast-food working older brother, and older sister who doesn't really do much at all. Marty's best friend is a scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown (""Doc""), who calls him and invites him to the mall parking lot at 1:15 in the morning the next day. So he goes, and Doc reveals what he has in fact spent the last 30 years inventing: a time machine. Unlike the past versions of what time machines would look like (generally a little room), Doc's time machine is in the form of a DeLorean (""the way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine out of a car, why not do it with some style!""). It has to go 88 MPH to work (along with a few other details I won't reveal now). After a series of surprises, Marty finds himself transported back in time to the year 1955. Right after he gets there, he accidentally runs into his parents (30 years younger; Marty's age now), and VERY accidentally, interferes with the event of his parents falling in love for the first time. Not thinking much of it at the time, he goes around town, looking for the one man who can help him: Doc Brown, 30 years younger. After he finds him, Doc realizes that Marty's interfering with his parents' first meeting could have VERY bad consequences. As I said, ""Back to the Future"" is not the best movie ever made.

It is also the unique insight it offers into a situation which we could never hope to experience, that of seeing our parents as teenagers.

Even though I was born in 1984 I am a huge fan of this movie. Michael J. Fox was perfect for the role. You just gotta love Marty McFly. Christopher Lloyd was perfectly cast as Doc and Lea Thompson was great as Marty's mother. But I think my favorite performance from this film was Crispin Glover, who played Michael J. Fox's father. I found it interesting that when the movie was made, Michael J. Fox was actually three years older than Crispin Glover. And they're playing father and son! Michael J. Fox was 24 and Crispin Glover was 21. Interesting fact! Anyway, Crispin Glover was the perfect nerd. You just had to love George McFly! And you just had to feel sorry for him for getting picked on by Biff all the time. I loved all of Marty's attempts to get his parents together before he was erased from existence while he was back in 1955. I loved how you got to see a perfect depiction of the era of the 1950s, from the cars to the high school to the ice cream shop and then you saw how it looked in the present day 1985. There's even a DeLorean in the film! The cinematography was excellent and the direction was on key and you just loved all the characters. The storyline was interesting too.

831,29 March 2020,k-09931,9, A quality classic film that everyone must watch at least once.,"This movie has seemingly battled time. And won!
I love this movie so much. The movie bring a funny and heartwarming side to the usually bleak time-travel. Most time travel movies are too caught up on the technical science side, which personally I love a factually correct movie, but it usually can hinder the writing and narrative if this is the case. Look no further than Tenet. I enjoyed Tenet but it does not give our protagonist enough development. Time travel is a means to an end in Back to the Future, so it does not get bogged down in the science of it all, even using that as comical device.
The heartwarming nature is derived from the theme of free will and how our actions can impact and affect those around us in more drastic ways than just on the surface.
Christopher Lloyd (Dr. Emmett Brown) has a natural flare for comedic timing and delivery. Couple that with his excellent acting overall and you get the full performance perfect for the supporting character.
Michael J. Fox (Marty McFly) has a brilliant performance in this, creating a natural chemistry between him and his parents, his girlfriend and most of all Doc. The Doctor and Marty bounce off each so well combining in a terrific all round movie.
Multiple questions of predestination and control of our future are asked through out keeping the movie fresh in your mind for days to come.
A full movie in any right. It could just as easily work a drama, sci-fi or romance, even without the comedy aspect.
There's a true sense if suspense and fear therough the final act, brining that true sense of cinema that can't be witness in very movie and even rarer in a comedy.
The death at the start, this is me not trying to give too much away, is powerful. In spite of not knowing the character and just having met him a few moments ago, through the acting writing and directing, you really connect to this character.
Probably the best comedy ever, it certainly is in my opinion",

The subtle contrast between the past and the future is a good aspect of the film, scattered with interest in the occasional flash of the plot, rather than the bomb-like arrangement.

It is invented by Marty's friend Doctor Emmett Brown(Doc). But the accident happenes. Marty privents his father and mother's first meeting accidentally. Then he has to get them back together before he changes time forever, and destroys his own existence. In addition, there is one more accident in 1985. It happens to Doc!! DeLorean uses plutonium as fuel so Doc steals plutonium from Libyan fringe group then they shoot him to death. So Marty has to tell Doc about this accident too in 1955. Will he able to solve all...or...!? This movie is enjoyable for men and women of all ages I think. It is thrilling and dramatic with happy ending. I recommend you to watch it and sequels(2,3).",

In 1985, Marty McFly (Michel J. fox) is a 17-year-old living in Hill Valley, California and his eccentric friend, scientist Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Loyd) who invents a time-machine, DeLorean are heroes of this story. One night, the terrorists find doc, and kill him because he steals plutonium for fuel of DeLorean. Accidentally Marty gets sent back to 1955, when Marty's parents are in their teens.

842,18 June 2008,mari_britain_1029,10, Best of sci fi movie!!!!,"Doc Brown, local character & mad-scientist, gets mixed up with Lybian terrorists who vow to murder him. All the old guy wants to do is to perfect time-travel for his own enjoyment...he wants to witness the birth of Christ and the signing of the Declaration of Independence, etc. Brown's only friend is a typical teenager, Marty McFly, who ain't yet sophisticated enough to know trouble when he encounters it. With Doc Brown seriously-wounded, but the Doc's plutonium-driven time-machine-cum-Delorean-sportscar very functional, 17-year-old Marty scrambles to escape murder himself...in fleeing, he goes back to the teen world of the 1950's and finds himself an unadmirable pal, who's actually his dad at age 18. Young ""dad"" is a pushover for bullyboys, he's a clumsy peeping-tom and a depressed, whining escapist who'll probably never amount to anything but a small-town failure. Marty tries to help his future-dad and ends up making matters worse for awhile. Our hero's in an almost-impossible situation and makes us laugh at his misfortune. I'll always stop and watch this almost-great movie whenever it rears it's head on the boob-tube. It's wonderful fun, from the faulty Rube Goldberg mechanics in the first scene, right through development of Doc Brown's hilarious self, then into Marty's frantic sexual unease when his own mother throws herself at him (quite innocently!). I'd thought all time-travel plot possibilities had been exhausted before this movie hit the big screen, but it proved me wrong with all kinds of clever elements, such as no one in the 1950's knowing what TV reruns were, how odd the clothing of 1983 would look to people 30 years back ""What's with the life-preserver, kid? Ya just jump ship?"", or the unfabulous treatment of blacks back in the fabulous 50's. We see an element or two of the future smartly interplayed with the time-travel plot, such as when Marty finds his 19-year-old brother's head missing from an 1980's wallet-photo he carries of his family, foretelling doom to the unborn if Marty doesn't fix what he just screwed up in the past. In 1953, Marty pleads with a much-younger Doc Brown to save his own life, but the ethical scientist refuses. So, we're now mighty sure that Marty is stuck in '53 and that he'll meet himself as a boy when he reaches middle age, or end up in some wild Oedipel-time-warp sexual life of sin. Even that comes off as funny. Naturally, in an adventure-comedy, everything turns out right (almost) in the end. The movie has a message for us, in the last scene. And, unblessedly, the message is a shallow, modern piece of Me-Generation horsedump. It tells us that parents can be ""with it"" if they encourage sexual-immorality in their teenagers, that the accumulation of material wealth and popularity are what matters and that worship of self is the ultimate guarantor of ""success"". But, the blessings of the DVD player are upon me, and I can ffwd the action from when Marty wakes up, fully-dressed, safely back in his 1983 bedroom, through to the closing credits!!",

He, and the rest of the movie, has a quirky, nerdy charisma to it. The movie has a very light pace and script that doesn't particularly harden the movie into a particular genre. The movie has extremely funny moments that show the contrast between a retro schoolhouse past and the eccentric and advanced present and the advantages taken because of it.

The writers (Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale) cooperated really well. When this movie came out in 1985, it was a huge blockbuster. It was the initial movie in the series of three. It covers many genres. This film wasn't adapted from a book. It was actually written in the writers' own words. Here's how I found out about it: I was at Universal Studios and I went on a ride called ""Back to the Future."" Then, after the ride, my parents told me about this picture.

A perfect blend of adventure, time travel and comedy that has the added bonus of a sparkling cast and a great 1950's backdrop. Christopher Lloyd is excellent as the wide eyed, white haired Doc Brown and Crispin Glover delivers a memorable performance as Marty McFly's nerdish father. This film made Michael J Fox a movie star and watching his energetic and adorable performance its easy to see why. Fox gives Marty charm and he has the rare and under appreciated gift of making characters seem likeable, this role fits him like a glove. Pratically rushed out to buy the trilogy on DVD when it was released and i know its a film that i will never tire of watching.

856,8 October 2003,starcollector73,10, The perfect movie package....,"When this movie came out in 1985, it changed the world of film making forever. Zemeckis' well-crafted movie was a critical and box-office success and for good reason. I cannot even begin to describe the effect this movie had on myself and all of my friends. We literally watched it every single day during the course of a summer vacation and still could not get enough. So many elements of this movie are wonderful and should be used more in other films. The script is excellent and the direction is even better. The opening with the clocks was magnificent and Christopher Lloyd's acting was superb. The DeLorean time machine was a real gas and real horror show! Michael J. Fox really hit it big with this one and his character was one many people could relate to. Hill Valley was a great imaginary little town somewhere in California and Marty's girlfriend was pretty hot, too. It was hilarious when he gets hit by the car and is forced to stay in his mom's and grandparents house for the night. Much of the content in this movie was highly ironic and coincidental, but still managed to stay far away from becoming corny. I'm surprised it did not win as much awards as it did. Everything from Biff to George McFly was great and all the sets were awesome. The final scenes were pretty heart warming and the prom scenes were cool, too. I also enjoyed the scene where Biff crashes his car into the manure truck. Can we get any funnier? I own part 2 also, but have still not been able to get myself to purchase part 3. It is missing something that the first 2 had. I really loved part 2 because it was much darker than the first. The whole ""Hell Valley"" thing was pretty scary and also with the Libyan's in the first one. Wow! This movie is amazing. I can't get enough of it. It supplies everything a person needs for a night of watching movies with some friends. So like, anyone not like this movie? I cannot imagine a person rating this film any less than a 9. I saw the sets at Universal Studios a while back and that was a great experience that I will never, ever forget. I obviously recommend this movie to everyone who likes movies and I'm sure it will pass the test of time in every sense. I wonder what people in other countries think about this. Hopefully, everyone around he world enjoys it. Stars: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas something, Crispin Glover and other people. Rated PG-13 (I think) for some violence and adult content. I give it a 9.5/10 just because it got a little boring during some scenes.",

This movie was done with style, and will always be the best sci-fi movie around. The acting is remarkable; Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) are the standouts in the film. Fox does a wonderful job portraying the average 80s teenager, while Lloyd made his voice heard in his career best performance. As for Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson, they add another ring to the story, and give it comedy, a rare occurrence in science fiction. There are several things that I could note telling how good this movie was. The concept of traveling through time has never exactly done well in the theaters before, but ""Back to the Future"" worked, as did its sequels. The small things also made this movie what it is today, like how realistic the 1950s were. During those scenes, you can imagine it being a 50s movie done in color. Also, the usage of the Delorean seemed like the perfect car for the time machine. To sum things up, I quote Doc, talking about the Delorean used for the time machine. ""If you're gonna make a time machine, why not do it with some style?"" And that's exactly how Zemeckis made this fantastic movie, with style.",

For good or bad, time puts things in their place. The current blockbuster happens to be an empty entertainment without much interest in delving into the issues that sometimes proposes. Back to the future is an example of this evolution to the current blockbuster. The themes of the film are developing roughly and put on the table interesting points but stays on the surface. The simplistic universe that proposes a priori annoying to take the movie as a serious thing but plays a lot in their favor to take it as a simple metacomedia of the time in retrospect.
BUT there are also good things, the script of the film is a masterpiece that nowadays is studied because it is so round. Its importance lies in giving coherence to science fiction that until then was left in second place.
The characters despite not being super complex are charismatic and work wonders even if they are medium interpretations.

It turned out to be a time machine in a Delorean. doc gets shot by some terrorists who doc tricked. Marty gets in the Delorean and drives for his life. when the car reaches 88 miles per hour he goes back to 1955. The people back then got freaked out when they saw him. he found his dad first, found out he was a peeping tom, then saves him from being hit by a car. That was a big mistake. he was awakened by his mom who was attracted to him. He finds doc from 1955. Thats when he realizes that his mom is in love with him instead of his dad. he must fix that while he finds out how to get back to 1985. he makes his dad develop courage and punch the bully who has bullied him for his entire life. then doc figures out that when lightning strikes the clock tower.

This film is without a doubt the best 'Back to the future' film ever made. What makes this film different from the other sequels is how it maintains its sense of fun and excitement all the way through the film. What I mean, is that although (Part 2 and 3) were good films, they didn't maintain its on-going thrill like the first film did. All three films had a sequence in which Martys mother/great-great grandmother had recovered Marty in either the McFly home, Baines home or at Biff Tannens home at the casino hotel until he woke up some hours later. In sequels 2 and 3 these films were good up until those scenes and then went completely down-hill after. In part 1, this film never went down-hill from beginning to end. The only aspect of this film that I didn't understand that I'm sure many viewers have noticed are the contradictions this film made (ie. Why George/Loraine McFly didn't remember Marty in 1985, from 30 years before - even though Doc Brown remembered him) which included even more contradictions in parts 2 and 3. Also the scene when the Doc was trying to send Marty back to 1985(via. The Clock tower) when the Doc was up the Clock Tower connecting cables, for that scene completely dragged-on. Other than this, this film was perfect in every way; The acting was good (especially by Biff Tannen/Thomas Wilson) it had an original storyline, perfect soundtrack, had great stuntwork and had a good dialogue. If you haven't seen this film, I suggest you do, as it suites viewers of all ages, classes and cultures.",

Hey I'm talking to you McFly you Irish bug!,"It is said that the director originally wanted to shoot a scene of a nuclear explosion, the company did not give money, so the story can only be placed in a small town. There is no nuclear explosion, no laser sword, the director and screenwriter must only attract the audience from the details.
Wearing the ck underwear, the protagonist of the Nike canvas shoes returned to 1955, simply changed the name to calvin klein, and pretended to be an alien to scare his father to a dance with his mother with a Van Helen tape. At the graduation ball of his parents, he played a gibson casino guitar and played a johnny b goode, and finally came a fan brother's hands to string, making the 55-year high school students stunned, the protagonist said: ""your kids gonna love it. ""And the guitarist with an injured hand called his cousin chuck berry to let him listen to the song, and rock music was born.
Skateboard chasing this classic bridge must have originated from this movie. The protagonist was in the west in 1885, the director paid tribute to clint eastwood. I do n't know if Fujiko Fujio has seen this movie. The hero in Doraemon has also set a talent for precise shooting. I remember in a long story, Nobita also became a cowboy and rescued the beauty. When the person selling the Colt pistol asked the protagonist: Where did you learn this hand. Seven eleven convenience store, the protagonist replied. And we already know the protagonist's skills on the game console in 2015.
The first dog of the doctor was Copernicus, and the dog in 1985 was already Einstein. I can imagine how many dogs the doctor has raised.
After reading it, I knew how much the movie Westward Journey and the 90s used to return to the future. Even if the classic sentence in the Journey to the West is in heaven, I think it is not as good as that of the doctor: She is one of a million, one of a billion, one of a googleplex. She is my dream, and I lost her for all time. """,

Chris plays the crazy Doc. who invented the time machine and made a mess in the first place! (Stealing some... well better not spoil it for you all). And the make this deal worth all your cash is there is three in the series and personally I think the first is the best the second and third is just as good, funny, and action packed!!

It's a must watch for anyone at any age, I'm 16 and I love it and this film definitely has a long shelf life. As for the storyline,it's fantastic and Michael J. fox and Chris Lloyd have such a great friendship and they really do make the film. The fact they chose the Delorean as the time machine is even better. This is my favourite Spielsberg film by far and truly is one of my favourite films of all time. Also this film really manages to overcome the big loopholes which are very common in time travel films, but this film addresses these issues and discusses the ways of a paradox and how it's dangerous to change the past as it may cause danger in the future.

The casting was intense with the hilarious Christoper Lloyd playing the eccentric Dr. Brown, and Michael J. Fox as the typical 80's teenager Marty McFly. I won't give the movie away, but Marty must get back from 1955 to his era of 1985 AND make sure that his parents fall in love. Otherwise, he and his siblings will never be born! The next 2 movies may have been less than amazing, but this movie starts it all.

Released in 1985 the film proved to be the sleeper hit of 1985 and redefined the time travel genre in terms of story and characterizations. The film's soundtrack is awesome with modern hits from Huey Lewis and the News, Lindsey Buckingham, Eric Clapton, composer Alan Silvestri and classic hits from Etta James and Marvin Berry(Harry Waters Jr.) and the Starlighters with special guest Marty McFly(Fox).  Lastly, the greatest time travel adventure to date with imaginative special effects and heart pounding excitement.",
890,24 December 2001,jeffreyrobillard,10, Quintessential movie of the 80s,"I do really like this film and it is from an era when I was a teenager. It definitely captures the mood of the eighties and also the nostalgia for the fifties which was prevalent in the seventies and eighties. I'm not really one for picking holes in movies as the whole point of going to the cinema is that you are entering a fantasy realm. However when watching BTTF recently I noticed a serious plot hole. There has to be a suspension of logic when time travel is involved but usually time travel films make their own internal cock eyed sense if you accept that time travel is possible. In BTTF though there is a lack of internal consistency which I will explain. When Marty travels back in time he alters history and returns to his own time to discover things have changed. This means though that there are in effect two Marty's. The one who we follow through out the film and the one who grew up in the history in which his father punched biff and lives a much better life. When Marty returns at the end he see's ""himself"", a different Marty, being chased by the terrorists and going back in time. The problem is, what happens to this Marty? Where does he go? The Marty at the end is the same one who grew up in the original history where his Father was run over by the car. If the second Marty went back to 1955 he would find the other Marty there with him. Also when the musician calls Chuck Berry to let him hear Marty playing Chuck Berry on the guitar we are supposed to accept that this is a case of effect before cause. But even in this context it doesn't make sense because Marty grew up in a different history in which Chuck Berry hadn't heard him play guitar and so wouldn't have developed that sound. Anyway, it's a fantastic film despite this or perhaps even because of this crazy paradoxical plot.",

I think this is much better than what Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest, where too many stories are unfinished. The story line in Back to the Future is very thrilling.

He however has a rather unusual family with his father (Crispin Glover) being a wimp, mother (Lea Thompson) an alcoholic, and brother and sister perhaps the most weird of the lot. We also find out that Marty has a rather unusual friend, Docter Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) who has been working on a time travel mechanism for the past 30 years. We are not shown Doc Brown until about 15 minutes into the film, however he is referred to as a 'real nut case who is very dangerous' by his Principle Mr Strickland who simply hates Marty's guts. We are soon shown how the device works by the Doc and Marty accidentally transports himself back to 1955 when a group of terrorists arrive to ruin both their days. Marty finds his parents are of the same age and destroys the way they are supposed to meet and suddenly it is an uphill battle from there, but with the help of the Doc who is 30 years younger, they come up with a plan that could help get Marty home (probably should've mentioned the time machine runs off plutonium).",

I actually found myself surprised that I actually liked the film. I did find a few flaws in it but they were pretty minor. The script was solid; The acting was right on point; the characters were very well thought out and the storyline was very rich. Now I will say that this film could have used a little improvement but other then that it was very entertaining. To be honest I am not a very big fan of time traveling films but this one caught me by surprise. Not a perfect film but no film is.

992,9 May 2012,BelmaresJodene,8, a smart and funny time traveling film,"The second movie is my favorite, where the gang goes into the future and experiences a world quite different from the mid 80's. I was a child from the 80's, and remember these movies well, and I also remember back in the day everyone thinking that the future would be exactly like this movie portrayed it to be like. It wasn't, at least not *yet* in the year 2007 (in the movie, they go to the year 2015, so unless some major changes happen in the next eight years, all those flying vehicles and life-like television screens will probably not be happening in our reality any time soon). It was just a lot of fun to sit there and think that back in the 80's, people really thought our world was going to change THAT drastically. Lots of fun scenes. Anyway, I haven't seen the second movie in quite a long time, and was surprised that the quality of the storytelling has held up extremely well through the years, and the movie doesn't look like your typical 80's film either (you know, with lots of dated-sounding loud saxophone playing, yuck!) I was also surprised that the characters actually went back to the year 1955 for quite a long time. Talk about telling a story with lots of twists and turns. Awesome! These are seriously some of the most exciting movies that have ever existed. The first movie is a classic, and the third one is really good as well, even though many people point to the third movie as being the obvious weakpoint in the series. Maybe, maybe not.

The history part of this movie that interest me is that it shows the differences between the two time periods, such in clothing, cars, places, buildings. My favorite part was when Martys' mom found him attractive. Overall I really enjoyed this movie, I would definitely watch it again .",
1001,6 February 2019,dianmart,8, Back to the future,"This movie is a classic and one of my favorites. I used to watch it when I was little and it has always been a family favorite. It has a fun story line and a very interesting concept. It has many great scenes. One of the best scenes in the movie is when Marty, the main character, realizes that he is in 1955 instead of 1985 and he meets his dad and Biff.
This movie is about Marty, a high school student, and his friend, Dr. Brown, a scientist, who creates a time machine in the form of a car. Marty gets transported from 1985 to the past in 1955. He meets his parents who are then in high school and he has to get his mom to fall in love with his dad so that he will still exist in the future.
The history in this movie is interesting because it kind of compares the 50's era with the 80's era. I knew about both eras before; mostly what the styles in clothing were. I really like the way they compared the two eras using the contrast between Marty who was from the 80's and his parents who were from the 50's and how they interacted with each other. It made me wonder what it would be like if I went to the past and met my parents.
The director of this movie is Robert Zemeckis. I have seen a couple of the movies he has made and thought that they were well made. The main actors are Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, and Crispin Glover. I haven't seen any other movies that I know of with these actors in it, but I am familiar with the actors Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. I enjoyed all of these actors in this show and thought they did a great acting job. My favorite scene from this movie was when Marty gets hit by his grandpa's car and meets his mom for the first time as a teenager. It was a well done scene because it set up the problem that Marty had to fix.
I just overall love this movie. It brings back great memories from when I was young. It is fun to follow and it has a different plot that really makes you think about what it would be like if something similar happened to you. I would recommend this to people who like science fiction and who just want a good laugh and fun movie to watch.",

It has something for everyone - romance, action, comedy, adventure, drama, suspense. It does not lag! Science fiction is not my first pick for a movie, unless it's REALLY GOOD SCIENCE FICTION, like the Star Trek movies or any of the THREE Back To The Future movies. In this movie, our hero (Michael J.

1012,30 March 2005,butNOOOO,10, 80's Movie Magic!,"Back to the future is a movie about a teenage boy, Marty McFly, who travels back in time to the 50's using scientist Doc Brown's experiment time machine. He travels through time in a modified DeLorean car. Things go wrong when he finds his parents back in the 50's. He had to make them fall in love with one another so the future goes as planned and he's born. If his parents don't fall in love, he won't exist.
A Lot of the movies made back then that were about teens, look like they've been set in between the 50's-70's. The clothing the people wore back in the movie portraying 50's clothing was, I think, fairly accurate. The clothing style was kind of like bowling meets disco (somewhere in between the two.) Robert Zemeckis was the director of back to the future. He's directed a ton of other movies. I've seen a few of the movies directed by him, but not a lot. I've seen A Christmas Carol, The Polar Express, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and lastly Forrest Gump. They were all super great movies and all so popular, as well as back to the future is. Forrest Gump is easily the best movie i've watched that was directed by Robert. It's more into the genre that I preferably watch whereas all the other ones are more kiddie movies (except for back to the future, that one's kinda for just about anybody, lol). What I liked about this movie was the clothing they wore in the time setting. I love movies with clothing from the 50's all the way to the 2000's really. I love to see the way clothing's changed throughout the years. I would recommend this movie to friends if they have yet to watch it. I loved the movie, always have, always will.",
1013,20 March 2019,karlgarc,10, Such a fun movie to watch!,"This is one of my favorite movies, as it is hits all of my interests. Like engineering, time travel/ conspiracies, action, and humor.
The plot of the story is great. I love how Marty goes back to his parents prime time in high school. The plot can also explain how one little effect can create a bigger problem.
History in the movie i feel like it is correct. The team to make this movie did a really good job of making one feel like they are in those two time periods that take place. The style of talk and dress looks to be accurate to that time period. Spielberg is a great director, other movies that I enjoyed watching from him include monster house, polar express, and my second favorite from him real steel. Micheal j Fox did a really good job playing the role of Marty Micfly. I don't beilive I have seen other movies from him.
My favorite part of the whole movie was the story. Time travel is so interesting to me. I also love the character of doc brown. As he is very optimistic and smart.",
1014,8 February 2019,martinruiz-35369,9, Back to the film,"Inventive, powerful, and wildly good fun, Back to the Future (BTTF) is an amazing film. Pulling off fun jokes and exciting set pieces with ease, BTTF follows the adventures of Marty McFly, as he travels back in time to 1955 to try and get his parents to fall in love. Christopher Lloyd is suitable manic as the off centre Doc Brown, the inventor of the sleek time machine, and Crispin Glover is an absolute standout as the nerdy George McFly. Lea Thompson is memorable as Marty's mom who falls in love with Marty in 1955 (leading to some great gags) and writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale ensure the film goes at full speed, and Huey Lewis provides a great anthem in the form of 'The Power of Love.' The sequels never matched the whimsy on display here, and for anyone who enjoys rollicking sci-fi, BTTF is the ultimate good time.",

I loved the pastel colors that they had. The filmmaker is telling you that they thought you could time travel and that there would be flying cars in the future. I also think the filmmaker is telling us that we dint want to be in high school with our parents. I already knew some of the music in this part of history and the cars they drove and the things they wore. Yes I have seen other movies in this part of history. Something that is similar is that we both have cars. Yes I have seen all of the back to the futures. I think that this is a good movie and I would watch movies with these actors before. I liked how it showed us the 1950's and the 1980's. I didn't like how the mom and the son had a weird relationship back in the 50's.

1029,25 December 2018,angusk-95091,10, Fantastic Film One of the very best,"Back to the Future and its two following parts take the time travel genre from HG Wells social criticism to social satire and beyond. While chock-full of '80s cues (the dress, designer labels/celebrities and Pepsi Free-remember that?), the film still manages to be eerily prescient. In 2015 you may buy a ""Mr. Fusion"" portable reactor that produces at least 1.2 gigawatts, but your flying car still runs on gas pumped at the Texaco station. What does that say about EV cars in the next few years? OK, there are no hover boards...but flat-panel TVs have all but erased tubes from memory, there's Major League baseball in Miami (or will be shortly) and the social decline of ""traditional"" white, middle-class suburbia is already widespread. And unlike those ""other"" depictions of the '50s, it wasn't all bobby-socks and sax; there was sex (and rape) too. The third episode is pure fun-the railroad sequence borrowing heavily from the Marx Bros-and I still get a hoot from the ""beard band"" playing Doubleback on the fiddle. A great romp through time.",

This film contains very dynamic characters (Marty and Doc) along with a few static ones (Biff). Spielberg's writing hits its mark once again by making a story with wonder but one that we can all connect with on personal levels. This movie it very fitting of being label as a classic that everyone sees.
While this movie is great, there is a few flaws. There is that classic 1980s super close up face shots that I cannot stand. Another problem with the movie is again an issue I have with a lot of 80s era movies, which is bad sound design. The super loud sound effects with a lot of the movie consisting of yelling.",

One of my favorite scenes is when Marty-main character- plays the guitar. It starts out with the blues but morphs into rock. The main plot of the story is that a kid goes back in time and accidentally messes up a few things. Which he then later has to fix or his life will be all messed up. The movie was set in the 80's then changed to the 50's when Marty goes back in time. What was interesting to me about the history was one, their clothes, and two their day to day life. I have seen a lot of movies set in the 50's and few are my personal favorite. Obviously a lot has changed when it comes to our daily life, but a few things have stayed consistent. Like high school for example had almost stayed the same. The director of the film is Robert Zemeckis, I have not seen any other movies that have been directed by him. I know two actors that are in this film, Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox. Christopher Lloyd was Doc Brown and Michael J Fox was Marty, I have seen both of them in other movies. I love both of these actors and I think that they do an amazing job in this movie as well as others. Another favorite scene of mine is the Marty on skateboard vs Bif and truck scene.

There are over 50 different plants and payoffs in this movie and what seems like half of them happen in the first 30 second of the film. Just in that opening title sequence we have all the clocks, the hanging of the man on one of them, the synchronization the song playing. And so many more. These plants are all paid off in full and can be seen meticulously curated throughout the film. Like the Lone Pine Mall pay off that took the entirety of the movie to come full circle. Or the main resolution to the problem that the flyer Marty decided to keep with the lightning. Another example of this is the audition to play in the band for prom and the ability for Marty to play the guitar and not being confident about it just like his dad with his writing and then when it comes to helping hos dad a lot of what the bully says and those is paid off in full with what goes on with Marty. Another aspect of this movie that is great is the visual symmetry found throughout and the character idealism. The two are very much center around the same truth and story line sop there are several parallelisms that make the film funny yet joint. Essentially this togetherness is what makes us laugh and enjoy it. This film is a great study piece for any film maker.",

1046,1 May 2001,TimeCruiserMike,10, Three Words Great friggin' Movie.,"35 years ago this week, one of the best blockbusters (and movies period) was released. This is my top 3 favorite movies (whenever someone ask what my favorite movie is I always say empire strikes back, raiders of the lost ark and this film) this movie follows 1985 high schooler Marty Mcfly (played by Michael J Fox) who has hopes and dreams of being in a band and having a better life but his family life sucks, his parents don't like each other and it's invaded by Biff (one of the best movie villains played by Thomas F Wilson) and a friend of Marty's, a scientist named Doc Brown (played MASTERFULLY by Christopher Lloyd) shows him his time machine he made out of a DeLorean (the best movie car ever) he ends up getting in it and accidentally gets stuck in 1955 (where he accidentally interrupts his parents meeting and his mom has a crush on him 😬) and he has to meet younger doc brown to try to fix his parents marriage and get back home to 1985 and we have one of the best movies ever (movies like this are honestly not around anymore) first off, the characters are iconic (the chemistry and friendship between Marty and Doc and is heart of this entire trilogy) and something people don't talk as much about this the technical side of the film (it's masterfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, it's shot beautifully with shots that give me chills, it's has one of the best movie themes ever by Alan Silvestri) and this is a masterfully written film (it's a script that scene to scene is full of amazing ideas that are executed to perfection) and of course, this movie is just a BLAST to watch (it's never boring, its funny, it's exciting and it's a movie I can watch any day, any time. In fact, I watch this movie at least once or twice a year ever since I saw it when I was 6) in the end, such original and inspiring movies like this aren't made anymore (this is one of the main films that made me want to make movies and this movie changed my life) with iconic characters, amazing writing, a perfectly made film and just fun and has inspired generations of film lovers and filmmakers (including the guys writing this review) because it did actually that great.",

Back to the Future has been a timeless film in my opinion. 1 that even if ya happen to catch it while flipping thru the channels you end up staying w/it. Character development is Supreme, plot is fantastic, comedy is added by a number of characters throughout the entire movie while still keeping just enough forward drama to not forget the point of ""I GOTTA GET BACK TO THE 80's.""

The time machine here is cooler, stranger, and more unique than any other. Instead of standing in a machine and getting dissolved, electrified, etc., the only way to travel through time, is to speed! Couple that with an original storyline, a weird and wacky duo (Michael J. Fox & Christopher Lloyd), and a (warning: spoiler ahead) suspenseful ending (don't worry, I won't ruin it for first-time viewers), you have a science-fiction-comedy that never seems to decline in quality. Definately the best time-travel movie ever!",
1058,29 March 2001,DC7,10, Best time-travel movie ever!,I have watched this movie many times and will continue to watch it many more times. this is my favorite time travel comedy movie and will continue to be. this movie did a really great job portraying the 80s from its language to its sets. the other Back to the Futures where also as good as this one. there was nothing not to like about the movie it was so great overall. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that has or hasn't seen it.,
1059,13 February 2019,samumemm,9, Great classic movie,This was a really good movie. I loved how you separated the two different time periods. The differences you put in there like their clothes and inventions that were created. I loved the excitement in the film with what he is going to do with his mom in high school and how he supposed to get his mom and dad together again. I also love how things changed with the littlest changes in the past. This was an exciting film all together.,
1060,4 February 2019,kasslundart,10, Love this,"Back To The Future is my favorite movie. I saw it for the first time when I was 10 years old back in elementary school days.
It is a movie about time traveling. Time traveling has always been exciting and fun. It's 1985 and Marty McFly is a typical teenager who doesn't like his parents and who has some problems at school. His best friend is Doc Brown, a weird inventor of useless machines. Their acting is awesome. I think this is not only because they are talented, but also because the director wrote a great screenplay, which showed how the acting should be in the film.
Also this movie has great ups and downs, which keep the audience's attention. Overall, I strongly recommend that you see this movie.",
1061,1 March 2019,b-20302,10, Best movie,"Back to the future is a funny and action packet movie which is a perfect family sit down. A 17 year old teenager called Marty Mcfly goes back in time to 1955 and has to find away to get back to his year 1987. The movie is great for all ages since its a action comedy has no swearing,and no physical violence.I don't recommend it for kids that are under 6 years old cause they might get a bit confused, but what is great is that for some older people they might connect with a few things that happens to Marty in 1955 that will seem weird to the new generation which is all normal back then, but anyway the movie still is great it has great acting and voice play with the main characters being Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd who is also in Star Treck. The director Robert Zemeckis has done a great job in explaining the characters so you can build a bond between you and them. I really recommend this movie.",

1063,31 January 2022,turkuaz-88197,10, Amazing,"The plot of the picture is quite simple: teenager Marty McFly, with the help of a time machine created by his friend Doc Brown, gets from his 1985 to the distant 1955. There Marty meets with his future parents, still teenagers, and a young friend, a professor. Marty violates the natural course of events of the past and is forced to put a lot of effort into making his future father and mother fall in love with each other. It's very interesting to watch all this. The brightest contrast of the two epochs and the way they interact with each other works best in the film. It seems as if a counterculture is being born before our eyes in the assembly hall of the Hill Valley school to the song of Johnny B. Goode. Schoolchildren of the 50s sat on the bench drinking chocolate milkshake - a little more and bourbon will pour into the punch, and rock and roll will sound on the radio. In such a subcultural explosion, Marty is like a superman who realized the change of epochs on his own skin. And let the parents continue to talk about chastity to their son. That's just worth Delorean to rush into the past, and the schoolgirl Lorraine will drink whiskey on the sly, and George in puberty - peeping at naked girls, sitting with binoculars in a tree. It's cool that people still watch this movie and admire it. You can see what the world looked like before and what it was. A very interesting film that makes you think, I advise you.",

I have always been fascinated by time travel and this movie demonstrates it to the full. If you're interested in time travel you will not get bored of this film!

1065,9 October 2006,Queeg500,10," A Cracking Film, One for the family","The creative and entertaining science fiction content in this film certainly is a draw. Aside from that, this film satisfies an urge most of us have to know and experience what our parents were like when they were young and falling in love, and to understand what it was life to live in those times. The film's depiction of the contrasts between the world of the 1950s and the 1980s gives viewers food for thought about how our culture evolved, and what we've gained and lost in the process. Performances are universally credible, sometimes brilliant, and advance the plot nicely. Another point in this film's favor is amid all the attractive technoflash, the director wasn't afraid to limn characters who have real feelings.",
1066,29 July 2005,cineaste1939,9, Science fiction with a psychological slant,"I watched this movie for the first time when I was like 7 or 8 years old, and it captured med instantly. The home-made ""garage-build"" high tech time-machine, that is in fact build into a DeLorean - a cool legendary sports-car of the 1980's, are simply stunningly awesome for young people, and if you are not young any more, well then you will be during the movie. The great story, the action-packed adventure, and most important; the extreme caution of following rules of time-travel and the creativity of the countless details in the three movies - along with the great cast of sympathetic and funny actors - simply makes this trilogy a must see adventure for people of all ages. I am now 27 years old, and I still watch the movies at least once or twice a year, and I still find myself observing new details that I haven't noticed before. This really need a re-release on the big screen in my opinion! (maybe with some remastering)",
1067,11 November 2006,Kaare-15,10, First chapter of a genius trilogy,"""Damn....damn!""
This movie takes place in the past, present, and future. A 17 year old boy gets sent 30 years to the past.
I think that it was really interesting the differences that there were in the different time periods. In the 50's segregation was still going on. African Americans were the waiters and didn't have any rights. In the 80's segregation was over and there was more acceptance. There was even a African American elected as mayor.
The director is Robert Zemeckis and some main characters are Lea Thompson, Micheal J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispín Glover. I haven't seen them in any other movies but I've heard about them.
I really liked the movies lines and plot. They had really funny sayings and the actors weren't that bad. I would watch this movie in my own home and recommend it to some friends even. Overall it was a good movie with very funny dialogue. And a interesting plot.",
1068,30 January 2019,leslvare,9, Review,"I will be judging the movie according to the date of this review. So for example: Even if the special effects are good for its time, they are above average for today. A gripping screenplay, sympathetic characters, iconic soundtrack, we can praise this movie until the morning, so I'm going to count the bad points because the rest is already very good. Even though I don't think there are too many bad things about the movie, there was one detail that caught my eye: Some of the chance events in the movie always seemed to happen in favor of our main character. I think this randomness undermines the credibility of the story, and even if it wasn't a bad thing, I wish we could have seen a scene about how Marty and Doc met (I know Bob Zemeckis explained it). I would like to thank everyone who worked on this movie for presenting us such a work of art and pay my respects.",

However, while scrolling down on the honor list I did not find Back to the Future included (Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back were there nonetheless and in my very humble opinion both films are space-epic rather than genetically pure Sci-Fi).",

A guy that happens to be a scientist's assistant falls in the limo of bad consequences leading him to traveling into the past (that car is invented by the same scientist who actually wanted to show the boy an achievement of his lifetime). Boy fled back to the history where he had to search for the doc to get back to his time, but he bumps into his parents causing disruption in nature's time continuum. He finds scientist and convinces him to make the boy travel back to his time, but scientist says firstly fix the disruption you caused or else you will falsify your own existence. Movie is a whole quest of boy in fixing time machine and getting things settled in order to avoid his own disintegration.

I haven't seen a lot of ""classics"" or old movies. I have seen Jaws, E.T and Clueless. I really didn't care about them. They were ""okay"" but nothing more.
But this movie is something else! The story is great! A lot of things happens, but not to many. I don't think, that anything is rushed over, which is one of the biggest fails in movies! It's a incredible idea! Where jaws is a great white shark, and that's basically it, this got so much more!
But the thing that amazed my the most was the acting! I really love the acting! From everyone! It's really insane how good these actors are!
And can we talk about that ending?!
So all in all, a MUST see movie!",

The characters are brilliant, the plot involves time travel and feels more realistic than most films nowadays. The nostalgia, references and perfect plot will have you hooked within a few minutes of Marty, Dic and co.",
1075,29 January 2019,mrayye,10, In my personal top 3,"The first part of the ""Back to the Future trilogy"" was published in 1985. The director Robert Zemeckis and the actors, especially Michael J. Fox (Marty Mc Fly) and Christopher Lloyd (Doctor Emett Brown) as the main characters created a fantastic film with an exciting storyline. The filmography is to be assigned to the science-fiction and comedy sector with the mixture of action and a lot of jokes.
The crazy professor Emett Brown develops a time machine included a special invention - the ""Flux capacitor"". He installed the device in a Delorean, which runs because of the high energy demand with plutonium - a high energetic and radioactive element. When doctor Emett wants to present his new invention to Marty - a boy from the neighbourhood - he was shot down by lybian terrorists, from whom he had stolen the plutonium earlier. To escape the dangerous situation Marty must use the time machine. Before he could do anything Marty lands in the year 1955 where he must save the professor and not at least himself and his whole family.
In the first part and also in the two others of the ""Back to the future trilogy"" there is a classic fight between the good and the evil. Biff Tannen and his gang are the bullies in Hill Valley, the setting of the film, which looks older or more futuristic due to the change to different time zones. In the future Biffs son and in the past Biffs dad are the troublemakers Marty has to deal with.
In my opinion the movie is one of amazing film works I ever saw. The acting skills of the single characters are wonderful and very satisfying. In addition to that the film effects and the soundtrack is wonderful although the film was made 35 years ago. I like the vibe of the whole movie, which always has a surprise in store. if you want to see for yourself, you absolutely have to watch the film. You will definitely not regret it.",

1) Doc keeps refusing to let Marty tell him about getting shot that night because it will ""endanger my own existence."" This makes no sense and comes off as blatant Screenwriting 101 in plain view as the story tries to create an inner conflict for Marty. Doc already knows about building the time machine and Marty getting sent through time, and he sees the video and it's pretty obvious what is about to happen.

Fox is in his best kind of character (teenage complicated guy) and if you're a Rob Zemeckis fan, you should watch it. I recommend it.",
1103,1 January 2003,Gustavo_Assano,7, Just for fun,"This film is fantastic, my no1 of all time and surely a film can never quite match the sumptuous mix of *actually funny* comedy, great sci-fi brilliance and a top plot?! Michael J Fox as Marty McFly has got to be one of the coolest characters in a film ever, and rewatching this classic never fails to amaze! Brilliant 5 * unbeatable!",
1104,19 October 2002,stokefan,10, Fantastic - age proof sci-fi action/comedy!,"Marty McFly is a teenager with a lot of problems. His best friend is a mad scientist. His dad is a wimp who gets picked on by the bully Biff. His mom smokes and drinks too much. His uncle is in prison. And he can't get his band into the Battle of the Bands because they're called the Pinheads and Huey Lewis doesn't like them. He comes home to find that Biff wrecked his dad's car, and he was planning on taking his girlfriend Jennifer to the lake. His friend Doc Brown calls him and says to meet him at the mall in the middle of the night so he can check out his sweet DeLorean. When Marty gets there, Doc Brown makes his dog Einstein drive the car and then he gets assassinated by Libyan terrorists. Marty drives the car and hides it in the bushes. Then he walks back into town to read the paper. He goes into a coffee shop and rips pages out of the phone book. He tries to order a soft drink but the soda clerk is confused. He is surprised to find his dad eating breakfast there. Biff comes in and yells at both of them. Marty's dad leaves to climb a tree and stare at Marty's mom with binoculars. Marty's grandpa runs over him. Marty's mom helps him get well after being run over and falls in love with him. Marty leaves his grandparents' house and runs to Doc Brown's house to tell him his mom wants him. Doc Brown wants to know who the President is, doesn't believe Marty. Marty shows him the sweet DeLorean. Doc Brown is impressed. Doc Brown wants Marty to go to school with his parents, and convince his dad that his mom is hot. His dad writes science fiction stories, and Biff doesn't want him going to the coffee shop, so Marty makes him listen to Van Halen, then makes Biff fill his car with horse manure. Marty's mom asks him to the dance. He says yes. He tells his dad to punch him in the face. He takes his mom to the dance, where Biff throws him in the trunk and tries to rape his mom. His dad shows up and punches Biff in the face. Chuck Berry's cousin lets him out of the trunk if he'll play with him. Marty's parents kiss, and Marty goes to find Doc Brown to tell him. Doc Brown is doing a science experiment with lightning. Marty drives the sweet DeLorean to the mall where Doc Brown is assassinated by Libyan terrorists. Marty is upset, but Doc Brown is alive. Marty goes home to sleep. When he wakes up, his family is rich, has better jobs, and plays tennis. Biff gives him the keys to the truck so he can go to the lake with Jennifer. Doc Brown shows up and says something will be wrong with their kids, so he drives them to go see them in a time machine he made out of the sweet DeLorean.",
1105,11 March 2010,johnwoody,9, Where we're going we don't need roads,"The first of the Back To The Future trilogy, and this one delivers. As a family movie it offers satisfaction on every front. Michael J Fox is perfectly cast as Marty McFly, the typical American teenager, falling in love and falling into the adventure of his life. His wild and whacky friend Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd, builds a time machine, out of a Delorean, and soon Marty is back in 1955, where he disrupts his parents first meeting and falling in love. The ensuing romp is amusing and engaging on all levels. You hate the bad guy for all the right reasons and cheer Marty on as he struggles to set things right so his parents will fall in love and he can get back to the future. You would have to be a cold hearted cynic not to enjoy this one. If you haven't seen it yet, DO!! 10/10",
1106,20 December 2002,haardwire,10, A feel good movie that has it all!!,"I love this movie. Since child. This film is very good, Michael J. Fox, was perfect for the role of Marty. The characters are unforgettable, Dr. Brown with his crazy ideas, a plot that makes you want to keep watching until the end. some amusing scenes, others that became classics. The best science fiction movie of the 80s. My 9 year old nephew loves this trilogy. I'm only 23, but I grew up watching this film, my favorite is the second. It is impossible to watch and not like. I think it's cool how everything connects this film. Marty is a cool character, like me and perhaps you, is an ordinary guy. It is the dream of every human being, able to travel in time, and we have fun when we see it in a movie. My score for this film is: very cool, best science fiction movie of the 80s. Never get tired of watching",
1107,23 March 2014,tx_t1000,10, Great Movie,This movie is one of the most unique and great movies of all-time.  Even though it got no oscar nods.  It has to be the greatest movie of the 1980's and close to the greatest of all-time.  From the beginning till the end it takes you on a roller coaster ride.,

The best scene is the skating scene in 1955 and the bit where Doc comes back at the end is just brilliant. Best film ever 10/10, 100%, 100/100",
1114,28 June 2003,danx64,10," Back up to the future, past, and present.","This movie is an unbelievable adventure of the imagination and the characters are brilliant. Doc the mad scientist, Marty the guy everyone wants to be but also has the anger of a small man lol. Biff the bully who everyone loves to hate.

1119,14 February 2004,eeyores_number1,10, fantastic!,The first part of one of the best trilogies ever. Pieces of this movie are constantly drawn up in the latter parts of the trilogy. All three movies are brilliantly united. One movie effects on another one and they are more like a one big story.  One of the best movies concerning the possibilities and difficulties of time travel. If you've only seen this one you should see the pt.II and III too.,

I cannot count how many times I've seen this movie. It's that good. A mix of sci-fi and comedy is overdone nowadays, but this movie NAILS it. Great characters, great plot, Amazing atmosphere.

1123,14 October 2018,mcjoakimplay,9, Most Entertaining.,"The most well thought out and put together movie, no movies, ever created. The characters are unforgettable and the plot is filled with 'edge of your seat' entertainment. Christopher Loyd is the perfect crazy scientist that I have ever seen and no one else can play that part. I am extremely happy they went with Michael J. Fox because the first guy just didn't fit Marty like he does. The ""Delorean®"" fit the time look perfect to. The effect of getting to see your parents young was a charming experience, But no matter what Doc. Brown stayed the same. The movie was made with real craftsmanship and it turned out almost perfect. I gave this movie a ten. A great movie for everyone.",

If you haven't seen any of them, sorry, didn't mean to ruin it for you. If you ever wonder what it might be like to travel in time, watch this, because it might just be pretty accurate (yeah, right). Anyone who hasn't seen this movie ought to.",
1128,20 January 2004,UnderDog387,10, Great Movie. Especially for a DeLorean fan...,"""Hello McFly"", weirdly enough is one of my favourite sayings.  This movie is just simply amazing.  Its one of my favourites.  The movie is extremely underrated by film critics just because its a sci-fi.  Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly, a teenager who accidently goes thirty years into the past in a time machine built by Dr. Emmitt Brown (Christopher Lloyd).  If you havent seen this movie yet, your missing out on a legacy.",

1132,7 August 2019,jamesdw-66657,8, The best film of the 1980s,"Since the beginning of time we have wondered, what it would be like to rewind time, and undo those things we either did not intend to do, or to do something we should have done in the past. This could alter our lives, in the present or future as we know it. The movie Back to the Future (1985), allowed me to live this fantasy. Although, the plot was based on a realistic scientific possibility, I know it to be just a fantasy in realization.",
1133,19 October 2012,JasmondGipson,7, Mankind Vs Time,"The minute I saw Michael J. Fox in Doc's house putting in wires here and there connecting to the large speaker and then it blasts-I was laughing away! I have hardly seen any movie that starts of funny! The making of the car is brilliant and I thinks that with so little special effects it is really the best! Many movies have this thing about wishes, they wish for it and ta da it happens-but hello how did it happen?! This car thing is really good for imagination and really persuades people to enjoy and let their fantasies fly with the characters in the movie. The best part I liked-I was snickering, when Michael-'Marty' is hit and found by Lorraine who is actually his mother brings him into her house and she has some feelings for him and 'wants him'-he freaks out! That was really funny, like I never thought of such a case when he is to see his parents in high school. It was really cool! The imagination is so rich that you feel like you are in the movie and enjoying the humor and the tensions that Marty has! There was one thing that bothered me-by the end of the movie when Marty wakes up and he walks by the dining room he stops and sees something really weird, there are different furniture and he spots his brother in his business suit and is unaware what it is, then he sees his parents and then collapses how did he end up here when his parents look older and there is new furniture which he wasn't familiar with and he ended up having a jeep? Plus when Doc turns up he has a new way of making gas It's confusing! But it didn't really matter because the movie was the greatest! I wouldn't mind if they make a newer version of these series of Back to the Future, with more visual effects and more action!",
