0,10 November 2017,classicsoncall,9," ""That's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen.""","If you're ever in the mood for just a flat out entertaining flick, you can't go wrong with 'Curse of the Black Pearl"". I wasn't writing these reviews when this movie first came out, didn't even know there was such a thing as IMDb. So I'm finally getting back to it this many years later and even though I'd forgotten a lot about the story, I was blown away all over again by the outrageous antics of Captain Jack Sparrow and those transition scenes where the skeleton pirates manifest in the moonlight. In fact, the story itself might be incidental to the special effects and physical stunts that highlight the action in the film. Johnny Depp of course makes the movie with his swish-buckling (yeah, I misspelled it on purpose) approach to the character, and you couldn't ask for a more fetching lady in distress than Keira Knightley, although she managed to hold her own against most of those menacing pirates quite nicely. Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush round out the rest of the principal cast, and each did a superb job. I've never gotten beyond this movie's sequel, 'Dead Man's Chest', but watching this one again inspires me to go forward and check out all the rest.",/
1,16 November 2020,mark.waltz,9," ""You better start believing in ghost stories. You're in one.""","What a great line to describe probably the greatest pirate movie ever. Certainly, it isn't perfect, a bit over the top, yet filled with characters that you love to hate or you can't resist rooting for. Thanks to the performance of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, this has become a long-lasting franchise of Disney car and love the many sequels that followed up aren't as good, Jack has remained consistently strong in the ones where he was given a great opportunity to show off his huge talents.",r
2,29 September 2005,MaxBorg89,9, Terrific!,"You will always remember this as the movie that made Johnny Depp a superstar and almost got him an Oscar.The fact that he didn't win isn't a problem,since thanks to him this is the best pirate film ever made.",e
3,13 May 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10, Phenomenal!,"If there was a minor quibble with the movie, it is that it is a little overlong. Putting that aside, this is a truly wonderful film, that is definitely one of the highlights of 2003. The whole film is a wonder to look at, with splendid costumes and very realistic sets. The script is just a gem, with classic and original lines like ""Stop blowing holes in my ship,"" that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate, especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming, likable rogue, and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role, sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas, because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off, I want to mention another aspect of the film, the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers, like James Horner(American Tail, Titanic), John Williams(ET, Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend, The Shadow) All in all, a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox.",v
4,24 April 2004,claudio_carvalho,10, One of the Most Delightful Pirates Adventure Ever,"When the daughter of the governor of a Caribbean island, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), is proposed by Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), she faints, fells into the sea and is rescued and saved by the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) but he is arrested and sentenced to death for piracy. Meanwhile, the town is attacked by the ship Black Pearl, commanded by the former first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who leaded a mutiny against Captain Jack Sparrow years ago. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth, and the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who loves her, releases Jack Sparrow and they steal the fastest vessel of the navy to follow the Black Pearl, Will trying to save Elizabeth, and Jack trying to retrieve his ship. Along their journey, many secrets are disclosed about the course of the Black Pearl and her crew.",i
5,4 September 2004,Brad2002,8, Surprisingly Good,"Although I had expectations ( from watching the trailers ) that this might be a good movie, I was still surprised that it's as good as it is. The story is actually more complex than I had expected, involving cursed pirates and their quest to rid themselves of the curse. I won't say more than that so as not to spoil it if you haven't seen it.",e

Anyways this movie is amazing. It is original, full of twists and turns, fun, funny... It deserves 9 stars. However considering the fact i had to lower criteria for 'modern' movies made in the past decade, i have to give this a maxumum rating because compared to them it should get 15/10 stars.",w
7,23 November 2003,Igenlode Wordsmith,8," Finally, a real swashbuckling film to make me laugh","""Even I love Johnny Depp, and I'm male,"" a previous reviewer declares, tongue in cheek. Well, I wouldn't go quite that far, but there's no doubt whatsoever that when I lost my heart to this film, Johnny Depp's outrageous Cap'n Jack Sparrow had almost everything to do with it. I don't normally review 'current' films, so the very fact that I'm writing this highlights an almost unprecedented event - after endless failures, Hollywood has finally rediscovered the spirit of the classic swashbuckler movie.",/

Even if it's only the first scene with Johnny Depp as Cpt. Jack Sparrow! While many/some have dismissed Johnnys performance here as being gay, I do think his intentions were others! That's not only because he himself said so in an interview (his inspiration being Keith Richards as he said), but also because I saw him as crazy, but genius guy, who was different.",r

Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots.

Was it a good economic decision yes, yes it was....but who cares? Certainly not me for this film is brilliant, in every single way. Acting: Flawless. Music: Perfect. Writing/Plot/Story: Exquisite.

14,11 May 2009,tburke85,10, Pirates A Terrific Adventure Film,"Pirates Of The Caribbean Curse Of The Black Pearl is a terrific adventure film with action, drama, suspense, some romance, and humor. Johnny Depp is amazing as Captain Jack Sparrow and he's clearly having a lot of fun with this character. The rest of the supporting cast are great in their roles including Geoffrey Rush as the villain Captain Barbossa, Orland Bloom as Will Turner a blacksmith, and Kiera Knightely as Elizabeth Swann. Gore Verbinksi does a fantastic job of bringing this movie to the big screen. From the action, to the drama, to the humor and adventure this film has something in it for everyone who's looking for an entertaining movie to watch. It really is that good and The Curse Of The Black Pearl is now one of the my favorite movies. With two possible sequels on the way lets just hope they can be just as good or even better than this one. Go see it you won't be disappointed even with a running time of 2 hours and 23 minutes the movie is fast paced and action packed. With plenty of humor thrown in that balances well between the drama, suspense, and action.",0

18,10 July 2003,rising_star-42,9, Bloody Brilliant!,"Pirates of the Caribbean is a well-written, well-made, and well-acted film. Do not expect a simple action film; it is humourous and creepy, fascinating and thrilling.  Like most films, there are a couple of holes here and there in the fabric of the story; but this film wasn't made for the Oscars, it's meant to entertain and it succeeds in full at that.  It's a jolly good time with some good actors (and great Academy Award Winner Geoffrey Rush) and high adventure on the high seas.  Not to be missed!",?
19,5 December 2013,connork97,9, This is a true classic,"There are two few action-adventure movies now a days that delivers such original characters, played by a truly incredible cast.

My only flaw of this film is that I wish it showed our sexy island during the film, but the Caribbean for a faraway foreign land was surprisingly quite pleasant in terms of looks, it did make me sweat just by looking at it though and I'd never go there for fear of burning my lovely white skin under the scorching Caribbean sun. So overall the setting wasn't brilliant but it was ok. Moving on, the acting was brilliant as were the characters, they were all so complex and therefore gave me a lot of food for thought. All the characters accents were also very nice and pleasing to the ear.",t

31,18 January 2021,alexpeychev,10, Johnny Depp is fantastic!,"Awesome action and swashbuckling adventure, great music from the likes of Hans Zimmer, good visuals and Johnny Depp's hilarious improvisational performance as Captain Jack Sparrow (the other performances are good as well but Depp's the highlight and you damn well know it) make the first Pirates of the Caribbean adventure a fun action flick that's not only a great first non-Touchstone/Hollywood Pictures/pre-2006 Miramax & Dimension PG-13 Disney movie but also a much better movie than a movie based off of a THEME PARK RIDE has the right to be.",

But we all went on the ride at Disneyland LA in summer 2016. Jack Sparrow is the consummate anti-hero, and modern (or at least, early modern) Odysseus, who is beloved despite his always questionable behavior, and always seems to end up on the right side, accomplishing good things (or at least preventing bad things), especially because his governmental antagonists or worse than he is. While not particularly powerful, this roguish pirate can win a fight, and seems always to cheat death. Most of all, he commands the respect of other (low lifes). He's CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow. And my kiddos love him.",

35,9 September 2004,jtindahouse,10, Johnny Depp Perfect!!!,"Magnificent! I will start off with the one problem so that I can end by thrashing it with compliments: Too long. If they had just cut out all the crap in the scenes which made this movie so long it would've gotten a perfect 10 from me (I gave it a 9). But anyway, no movie is perfect. To the compliments, Jack Sparrows (Johnny Depp) was out of this world. His performance was just outstanding. No one in my opinion could have done the role better and I could probably find a better person for the role of just about every main role in a movie except this one. The way he says things are the kind of jokes that make you laugh in your head and think about what and outstanding movie it is without laughing out loud. It's like when you go a movie with someone and you don't hear them laugh once but when they come out they say it was the funniest movie they've ever seen it's because the jokes are the kind that if you laugh out loud you're going to sound crazy. That's what all comedies look for and this one got it right with Johnny Depp.",
36,17 March 2009,jburtroald95,10," Pure pirate perfection, to see this film once is worth all the gold and silver in the world!","The idea of plucking a long-time neglected genre out of the dark, combining it with concepts introduced by a theme park ride and throwing the varied combination of Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley does seem bizarre and risky. Admittedly director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer had no idea what they had created when they first released this spectacle into the theatres, and certainly weren't prepared for its instant monumental success. Though one must remember that nowadays twentieth century pirate adventure flicks are considered predictable and shallow light entertainment that really only haven't been criticised because of when they were made. Indeed, you might say that it is a miracle that this film was even accepted by today's audience and its creators were very fortunate not to be insulted over and over by thousands of cynical and terribly displeased critics. But no it definitely wasn't fortune that got this over the line and beyond, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of The Black Pearl' differs greatly from the others in many ways. The major one being Depp's exceptional performance as the film's central character: notorious, elusive, sly and unpredictable rogue Captain Jack Sparrow. His unique portrayal turns what could have been yet another classic specimen of a famous stereotype into a character that is hilarious, charming, poignant and perplexing.",
37,10 July 2003,xer0derm,10, A movie to be enjoyed for all ages and years to come,"The film was filled with extreme comedy and great action scenes.  Much of Depp's acting was reminiscent of his work in Fear and Loathing, but it was hillarious and well worth the nine dollars.  The action scenes were packed with entertainment, and were very frequent. All ages can enjoy this movie, and most likely will.  If you have the ability to get to a theatre, go to one, and see this movie.",

It's a wild ride that keeps you laughing and thrilled from beginning to end. Johnny Depp is incredibly funny and incredibly sexy, and since potc I have become a JD addict, which is costing me a fortune on Ebay. The special effects are perfect - the pirates are very funny and not overdone at all. It is fun for all the family, and I can't think of anybody who isn't a complete kill joy, who wouldn't enjoy this film. It's always worth a watch when you need cheering up.

42,26 July 2006,Torgo_Approves,5," Fun movie, but doesn't deserve such high praise","Yes, Johnny Depp is one of today's greatest actors and it's amazing that he'd dedicate so much time and effort to a character in a flavour-of-the-month fad movie like this one. But really, that's all there is to this film. If another actor entirely had played Jack Sparrow, this movie would get a 5 from me, tops. It is simply an extremely forgettable film. In 20 years, who will even remember who played Will Turner or Elizabeth Swann? Knightly and Bloom are good to look at, but they'll soon be past their expiration date and, let's face it, no one watches their movies for their acting.",

44,19 January 2021,turnerw-28359,10, This one doesn't need any introduction,Wow. I gotta say this movie is one of the best 2 hrs and 23 min I spent my money on and it was well worth it too. This is above Disney vault and I'm glad that Disney didn't keep any of them locked in it's vault where you can not get to them even when youngsters wanted to see it. We got Johnny Depp humorous performance as Jack Sparrow but it's once again the action sequences that kept me hooked. I'm not really a fan of Geoffrey Rush but the other two main ones also did a wonderful job as Turner and Swann played by Bloom and Knightley known for her period movies. We also got to worry about the British too but they don't matter. It's not boring and doesn't jump around either. Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer keep making those they will have a place on the great movies hit. 10 out of 10 for this one.,

After all, the title did give a cheesy feel to the whole thing. However, I must say that within 10 minutes of the film I was completely spellbound by the film, characters, and plot. The fight scenes where well done and not over dramatized, the animation of the skeletons was smoothly done, and the acting was incredible. ",
49,20 August 2008,Ross16,9, Great Movie,"This is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. Each actor did a great job. But the one that really stands out it is good old Johnny D not to mention he's hot but he has a lot of talent. his portrayol of capt. jack sparrow is what makes this such a great movie to watch he's funny charming and witty. my suggestion is to go out and buy the DVD. it has a whole CD of special fetures that are just as good as the film. I rate this movie 9/10. The extras on DVD are fantasticE to get it, it will be WELL worth the money, you will not be disappointed one bit. I have seen it MANY MANY times and I still find it funny, it REALLY is a must see film. The only problem with this movie is Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley. Too much screen time for such unimportant story lines. Pirates should have just been more on Captain Jack Sparrow and less on the sickly love birds. It doesn't add much to the story.",
50,24 August 2008,Rockford_6,9, Masterpiece,"As everyone here can see, many of the comments about this movie is positive. The Writing was excellent and i can give it a 9/10 for just its writing. There are tricks and twists in this story. Hence, for those who have not vote, watch this movie again and concentrate with their actors and the script. I am sure that, you are going to enjoy this movie for the next round. I think there will be another movie coming out for this, hence i encourage everyone of you to watch it. Although not a classic piece of film-making, the movie was never intended to be such and did exactly what it intended to do - entertain. The make-up and costumes for the pirates were very well done and most of those same pirates were very well played. The town of Tortuga and the ships were also quite impressive. Geoffrey Rush was very good in his role as Barbossa, although perhaps he should have been more evil. Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce were very good in their roles as Commander Norrington and Governor Swann. However, as already mentioned a million times, Johnny Depp completely steals the show with his wacky performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. This character should have been pretty one-dimensional but instead he's larger than life. Sparrow is a very memorable character. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley had perhaps the two worst performances in this movie. Their characters were so flat that one truly doesn't care what happens to them. Looking handsome or pretty just doesn't cut it. Another complaint is the extended scenes involving fights with skeletons. Although the CGI pirates were impressive, the fight sequences near the end go on far too long. That said, the movie is still surprisingly good and very entertaining.",
51,17 April 2005,mOVIemAN56,3, Another Jerry Bruckheimer Piece of Trash,The first thing I realized when I saw this film was that Disney is running out of ideas for good films. I never thought they would be resorted to base their films of rides in their amusement parks. It's a pirate film with some good acting but Orlando Bloom proves yet again that he can't act. ,
52,17 May 2022,CoopertheBeagle,9, Modern classic action adventure film,Rewatching in 2022 and it still holds up well. The score is especially good.

55,3 December 2003,=G=,8, The worst pirate movie ever.,"Just kidding. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" is an extravagant and sumptuous feast albeit an awful lot of talking...and we all know pirates were long on plunder and short on words. It's politically correct Disney all the way with this watered down and convoluted family fun fare which has delighted the critics and public alike. However, there was no black eye patch, no peg leg, no hanging from a yard arm, no pieces of eight or dubloons, and its common knowledge that planks were always walked blindfolded which was a big part of pirate fun. Also, what's up with sword fighting someone you can't kill? Good stuff even if it was an encyclopedia version pirating as opposed to the more real good ol' Hollywood version of the buccaneer. (B+)",
56,14 December 2003,Theo Robertson,8, I Liked This A Lot,I never believed I was going to enjoy CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL as I stuck it in the DVD player . After all it was produced by Jerry Brukheimer who's only real critically acclaimed film BLACK HAWK DOWN is down more to director Ridley Scott rather than producer Bruckheimer and let's not forget he also produced Armageddon and PEARL HARBOR two of the most obscene wastes of money Hollywood has come up with in recent years . In fact I would have paid good money NOT to have seen either of these films ,

If you think about it, this was Disney's first PG-13 film; thus, if ""Pirates"" had flopped, Disney likely wouldn't have continued to make PG-13 movies and, for better or worse, likely wouldn't have acquired more mature properties like Star Wars or Marvel Superheroes.",

Mr. Depp is able to completely submerge in whatever character he plays and he does so amazingly in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow. A pirate with a heart of gold! Oh, the movie is great, too!

I was pleasantly surprised by how the movie started. I was actually riveted, by the funny action and the amazing performance of Depp. Like I said, I'm not a Depp fan and I usually can't stand him in anything but as Jack Sparrow, Depp is totally amazing. Depp created a real character here, no matter how campy he is. Unfortunately, once the pirates invade the port and the story concentrated on them, the film became really tedious and I didn't care about anything. The film should have concentrated more on Sparrow and the two other characters. The pirates, or ghosts, are devices and it's almost impossible to care for them. The story became sillier and sillier and Depp, who's the ONLY good thing in this movie, went missing for long periods of time. Bloom and the actress were pretty much flat.

Johnny Depp really did his best in this one, and I was not even the smallest surprised that he did an amazing job in this movie.

68,16 April 2004,jhmb2003,4, Another childish flick,"This movie, as 99% of Hollywood's productions, was made for kids and teens, or people who think they are still kids. I don´t want to say it's bad or stupid, it's just...like a floppy, disposable, toy. As an adult, I felt a waste of time sitting down and trying to watch this kind of material, even with one of my kids besides me, enjoying it. Saying this, if you take this movie seriously you can point out the following: 1. It lacks of historical accuracy or even the remotest realism (pirates were bandits blessed by the Queen who used to attack Spanish vessels, I guess, or someone told me that). 2. All the characters are caricatures from a comic strip 3. The plot is 0, nil, nought, zero. 3. The formula: Maximum adventure with Minimum suspense (poor Hitch!) 5. Avalanche of FX to keep the children amused. 6. No dialogs, no conflicts, no real life. But, who wants these things today?",
69,20 February 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,3, Just bad,"When I sat down to watch this movie, I was expecting to see a movie that was decent at best. I was very surprised to find how unbelievably bad it was. The plot is non-sensical jibberish. The characters are all one-dimensional, either good-to-the-heart, or bad-to-the-bone, with absolutely no variations. The acting is horrendous, Johnny Depp is like a washed-up rock-star, heavily drugged and very drunk, the entire time. Orlando Bloom is nothing but a simple rehash of the knight in shining armor, if only a bit more easily tolerated. Keira Knightley is just a damsel in distress, pure and simple, nothing else. Something I found ridiculous, was that every other character, even minor characters, mastered sword fighting. The humor is unbelievably childish, at several times it was on the level of the newer Simpsons episodes, which made me cringe more than I believed was possible. All of the CGI effects were very bland, most looked like they could easily have been made at the same mediocre quality several years ago. Why so many people claim this is a great film eludes me. If you ever even consider to sit down and watch this, make sure you keep your expectations very low. Very overrated. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, as it is simply too long, too boring, too bland and too cringe-worthy to be the least bit enjoyable. 3/10",
70,9 May 2004,Superunknovvn,6," Good but overrated, too.","8.0 is a much too high rating for this good but not great movie. I like the fact that a movie finally does justice to pirate stories. It's strange that this genre, which sure holds a few adventures in store, hasn't been too successful until ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" hit the screen. Anyway, ""Pirates..."" is just that, a funny adventure in the tradition of ""Indiana Jones"" and ""The Mummy"". It's got everything: ghost pirates, abandoned islands, a beautiful governor's daughter and a brave young hero (or two heroes that is). The dialog is witty although I feel that it could be even wittier. The direction and the special effects were not too special (nothing compared to Gore Verbinski's great job for 'The Ring'). It was funny to see Steve from ""Coupling"" and Gareth from ""The Office"" on the big screen for the first time. They should have brought Jeff in as well! All in all ""Pirates..."" is a fine popcorn movie and surely the summer's best Blockbuster. I hope that maybe after the success of this movie, Hollywood thinks about turning ""Monkey Island"" (the classic adventure game by LucasArts) into a movie. Just a thought.",

To go in more detail would take hours because, unfortunately the plot's long-winded and has more twists and turns than one can keep up with in one sitting. Nevertheless, while Pirates veers into the basic formulas and clichés of any other pirate movie, it does so with purpose and style, to make a quality ride out of a familiar outing.

76,28 December 2006,thinker1691,8, The Celluloid Pirate,"In the eighteen century, in the West Indies of the Caribbean Sea, there roamed a magnificent seafaring group of individuals who prided themselves in not only creating an adventurous and certainly idealistic way of life, but enamored a secondary generation to emulate their deeds centuries after their demise. They became known as The Pirates of the Caribbean. Today, the Disney group is satisfying the demand of the visual interpretation of said pirates. Reflecting and certainly echoing their traditional exploits is Disney's film version of the same name. In this film, Johnny Depp, is fabulous as Captain Jack Sparrow. This individual is a small package filled with more excitement than a barrel of gunpowder. Throughout this film he consistently invites the viewer to follow him from multiple escapes, duels with sword makers, damsels in distress and British Soldiers from the port-cities and market towns, in search of a cursed ship called The Black Pearl. Strewn throughout this adventure are Depps' fellow actors which include, Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, Orlando Bloom who is superb as Will Turner, Jack Davenport as Norrington and Keira Knightley, as Elizabeth Swann whom seems at times incongruous and out of place as the precursor of a modern feminist. Despite the awesome, incredible, often ideal locations and speculator scenery, studded with everything, but the essentials allowing the film lack to resolution for Sparrow or the viewer. Often we anticipate either, to be thrust into yet another hair-raising adventure or a ghost chasing episode which is setting itself up for a further sequel. Thus despite it's wondrous appeal, and Sparrow's ever changing destiny and demeanor, ( which by the way is a bit, effeminate, the film lacks adhesion to either traditional pirates or to their eventuality. In the end, it's a good film, which insists on re-creating itself again and again. ****",

The mix of practical effects, stunts and CGI really gave the film the dazzle of a summer tentpole. AND Depp's and Rush's characters were supporting comedic foils for the Elizabeth and Will.

The images are fairly beautiful making a pleasure for the eye, both static and action ones. The characters are sufficiently typical and convincing and the stereotyped traits of some of them are aimed at making you laugh. And what about the story? Well as you know the story in this kind of movies is always the weakest part with its usual flaws but we must tolerate it as the necessary conducting wire giving a logical sequence to all the scenes.

86,16 July 2003,Quinoa1984,7, An entertaining jumbalaya of a pirate movie,"Two reasons to see Curse of the Black Pearl (and I'm speaking more to adults, kids will see just about anything they can get into admission-wise) are the effects done on the crew of the Black Pearl, and two performances amongst those that were OK but nothing special- Geoffrey Rush as the taut, creepy captain of the Black Pearl, and especially Johnny Depp as the somewhat unconventional captain Jack Sparrow. On this site it's said that Depp patterned his character's moves and voice after Keith Richards, which I can see, however my first impression watching him was that he was basically playing Raoul Duke from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in a pirates cap and with gold fronts. This is indeed an original turn for Depp, even if we've seen him do something like this before, and it helps when a persona is this fresh in a story that counts the numbers a bit too often.",
87,2 July 2021,vithiet,9, Another classic that doesn't age!,"I have to give it to Disney: they don't always get it right but when they do, what a treat! Some movies become classics because they're overall masterpieces like The Godfather, they become a phenomenon like Star Wars, or they set a new bar like The Matrix. But sometimes, like Pirates of the Caribbean each element may just be good but the sum of it all just works resulting in greatness. When I first went to see it in theaters, I really didn't expect much from a Disney ride inspired flick; what a surprise! It has everything an epic adventure movie should have and Johnny Depps' performance is just icing on the cake. Here we are 18 years later and I still enjoy it like the first time I saw it. This is the perfect family move, which I would highly recommend introducing the younger generations to, just like Back to the Future!",

The cursed tale of a pirate ship's captain, marooned by his mutineering mates and left for dead on a desert isle. He returns with another ship, this time stolen from the Royal Navy, in order to reclaim his rightful command of the infamous Black Pearl, a ship so evil that hell itself spat back her dead. He is joined by the son of a murdered pirate ship's mate, a swordsman who's skill and craft are equal to that of Robin Hood himself.

It was one of three films announced that would be adaptations (for lack of a better word) of rides or shows at Disneyland. The first was The Country Bears, which I skipped and the third was The Haunted Mansion, which was none too impressive. Pirates of the Caribbean had probably the best cast, headlined by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, and was produced by uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer. I was still skeptical, but Pirates of the Caribbean proved to be better than it's pedigree would suggest. It is an entertaining, enjoyable romp, albeit a little overlong.",

I always looked at Johnny Depp as he is Hollywood's last ""rebel"" and seeing him in a big budget production ( like the average Bruckheimer film is) would mean we've lost him too. By ""rebel"" I mean that he chooses the roles he really WANTS to play. For himself or for his Hollywood friends ( like Tim Burton for example ) So, in that way, I'm glad to admit I was wrong.

I bought the DVD because I'd heard good things about the movie, and I've been to both Disneyland Paris, and Disneyland Florida and loved the Pirates ride at both of them. Having been on the ride, it's quite easy to spot many things in the movie that pay tribute to the ride, especially in the town scenes. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought the movie, but I definitely didn't expect to laugh so much! This movie has such a wonderful combination of excellent acting, astounding special effects, and dry humor. Johnny Depp steals practically every scene he occupies, and Geoffrey Rush is excellent and sinister in his villainous turn. It's about as high-quality fun as one might demand in a summer blockbuster, and will have you singing ""Yo ho, ho ho"" for days and days to come.

Some movies do such a good job somewhat smaller cogs that make a movie, that makes it seem so important, it leaves you wondering why this much focus isn't spent on other films. Pirates does this in many areas.
-Costume design for one. The costumes are such a strength, made even better alongside the intricately detailed props. Everything feels and looks authentic.
-The ships are also very cool! This is one film's set design I would love to visit and be a part of.
-The soundtrack has been one that has been in my head, stuck for nearly two decades. Equal to the greats like Howard Shore or Hans Zimmer. It brings so much action and joy and makes you want to move around for sure.
-Lastly the actors. Such a good cast and hard to think that this was the early breaks for Orlando and Keira, who are now pretty big deals. My most favourite role of Johnny Depp, don't really like him in anything else, but he's awesome in this!

The plot was like a thread that would be dropped for 10 minutes, then picked up again. Johnny Depp was superb. What a strange character he created. It begged the question, though, of how this goof could have lived more than 20 minutes as a pirate. Finally, and a minor spoiler. if you end up cursed for stealing Cortez's gold, didn't the governor's daughter steal the gold from the unconscious boy? Just wondering.

Sometimes they're so filled with clichés and bland characters I can't stand them, other times they surprise me with their level of quality. One example of the latter would be this movie, which I think is way better than it's given credit for, and there's multiple reasons for that. First of all is the immersion. The set, costume and sound design are all amazing and make it easy to pretend you really are in 18th century caribbean. The editing and cinematography are also both really good, and the score is practically perfect. The plot is engaging, the pacing is great and the worldbuilding is very well done. The characters are also good, Will and Elizabeth both have their struggles and weaknesses while also being pretty likeable. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley both play their roles exceptionally well. However, the movie's biggest stars are Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, each giving the best performance in their career, as Jack Sparrow and Hector Barbossa. While Sparrow is goofy, entertaining and a very likeable anti-hero, Barbossa is vicious and threatening, whole also having legitimate reason for his actions and understandable motivations. Every time one of them is on screen, it's a joy to watch. They both serve as important characters for the story while also being one-liner machines. This movie also has great continuity and lets no arc stay unfinished. This is a movie which has just grown on me as the years have passed, it's one of my all-time favorite movies and I have no problems giving it the highest rating I can.",

The introductory scene is also stunning, one of the most spell-casting experiences I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. The Interceptor creeping through a mist-shrouded sea, the umbrella floating by, the magnificent horror of seeing a burning merchant ship, and our first glimpse of the Black Pearl as it sails into the fog.

Johnny Depp's performance is universally extolled and rightfully so however for me the tour de force performance was that of Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa. Rush morphed into an 18th century pirate from the golden-age of piracy and for me his performance is the gold standard for portraying a pirate. Good performances abound in the first installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean series (it should have been the first and last but greedy studio executives had to soil a good thing for a buck) it wasn't merely the Depp and Rush performances there was also the performance of lovely and delightful femme fatale Elizabeth Swann (aka.

On the way, Will learns that the Black Pearl used to belong to Jack, who lost it after Barbosa lead a mutiny against him. But, Jack is lucky, because soon after the Pearl was stolen from him, the crew had a nasty curse put upon them. Which makes them invincible, but turns them into skeletons in the moonlight. Not only that, but the crew needs the blood of a Turner (Will Turner!) to break the curse! This movie is an exciting, swashbuckling tale that doesn't fail to entertain you with eye popping battle scenes and asurbic wit. The running time is about 2 and a half hours, a bit long for a summer flick. But it doesn't bore you at all. The entire time your into the story and being dazzled by the action (and beauty of Keira Knightley). Movies like this aren't made...ever! When was the last time you saw a pirate movie?

It conformed to a current style of film-making which sadly involves substituting boring stunts and ho-hum special effects (all of which have been seen countless times before)instead of a decent storyline and real atmosphere. This sort of treatment was fine during the 1980's when Indiana Jones and the like seemed fresh and fun but surely young cinemagoers are entitled to something more intelligent in 2003 - such as a plot that makes sense, straight acting and some semblance of historical accuracy. And another thing.. where on earth did Johnny Depp get that accent from? He sounded and looked like an inebriated Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones!",

There hasn't been a high enough level of mathematics invented yet to number the pirate cartoons made. Several of the 'immortal' classics such as 'Treasure Island' are about pirates.

172,7 April 2006,Hitchcoc,8, Too Many Rules to Follow,"I certainly enjoyed this movie. Johnny Depp's mugging and swashbuckling. His sly expressions. The conflict with the power structure which would like to see him hanged. The special effects are quite impressive. There are two problems that kept me from giving this the ultimate rating. It is way too long. I don't know if they edited anything out of this. The thing with the ghost ship was endless. Secondly, like a video game, there were all these rules we were supposed to remember. The ones that mortals are supposed to play by and the ones the ghosts must play by. I'm starting to feel that for some films, we should be given a handbook to keep it all straight. Perhaps an in-service of some kind. When this is mostly a pirate movie, it is great fun. There are battles; there is tongue in cheek commentary. There are beautiful women who can stand up to any man; you name it. When the supernatural element enters in, it is also fun. But there's something about being forced to kill people that are already dead. Just exactly is it that you must do? Again, play by the rules. Anyway, it's a wonderful romp.

175,17 August 2003,nurse_ratched,9, I'll drink to this one me hearties!,"At first glance, you can be forgiven for being sceptical about Pirates of the Caribbean. A movie title taken from a slow-moving, Disney theme park ride in a genre in which Hollywood has failed to make any real imprint onto since Errol Flynn's swashbuckling days. On closer inspection, however, Gore Verbinski's latest offering, penned from the writers of Shrek, boasts an impressive cast and a trailer showing just a glimpse of some the amazing CGI special effects that no Summer Blockbuster can do without. So, did Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean 'shiver me timbers' or did it make me want to run off the nearest plank? I am pleased to report that this film more than lives up to the preceding build-up. It looks gorgeous (helped along by the fresh faces of our disgustingly handsome hero, Orlando Bloom and his, 'bonnie lass' Keira Knightley); it has just the right mixture of romance, action and comedy and is a showcase for one of the most mesmerising and innovative performances this year (move over Errol, Mr Depp has landed.) Probably one of the most underrated and the most unconventional actors in Hollywood, Johnny Depp masters the character of Captain Jack Sparrow and creates a half-drunk, half-insane pirate, delivering the gags with almost perfect comic timing and an assortment of hilarious mannerisms. Alongside Depp, Geoffrey Rush plays the villainous Captain Barbossa, doomed to live as a cursed man because of his greed and piracy. Rush ensures that Barbossa is a genuinely creepy character whilst even managing to evoke a degree of sympathy for him as he wanders miserably through life in a desperate struggle to lift his curse.",

178,25 January 2004,kayester,3," Full of sound and fury, but signifying nothing","This is one of those movies you hate to pan, everyone on screen seems to be trying so hard to make something out of the material. Sometimes, even the best efforts can't rescue a plot thinner than the skins of the villains. And therein lies the problem. All the special effects, all the fencing, and ship to ship fighting, can't rescue this film. Given the lack of a story worth hanging a hat on, Johnny Depp does his best to give the film a center, but he is undercut. On one side is Geoffrey Rush chewing scenery faster than it can be built. I keep hoping to see him in a role that requires some subtlety, because I believe he is capable of greater things than anything I've seen him in recently. On the other side are Orlando Bloom and Kira Sedgewick gamely trying to give the film some romance. If only they were given some material to work with.

Depp plays his role brilliantly, there is not a dull moment when he's on screen and Bloom portrayed the love-sick blacksmith perfectly as well. Knightley's role was a bit modern(strong, take-charge feminist), but that also added to the movie, she was great. I could go on about the actors, but there wouldn't be any more room, they were marvelous! This movie is mysterious, every single time I watch it, I can barely pull myself away from the screen!

After the movie, you will definitely want to see the continuation of the story, and yes, we have the four sequels and the fifth one is coming next year. The sequels aren't as good as this. Must-watch definitely. Don't miss this movie",
182,13 December 2014,Horst_In_Translation,6, Good start to a long-lasting franchise,"The very first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie was a huge success at the box office and at awards ceremonies. It was no°3 at the 2003 box office behind the final ""Lord of the Rings"" chapter and ""Finding Nemo"". Also it received 5 Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor for Depp (his first nomination ever) and also an SAG Award for him. That is also why there have been 3 sequels already, no°4 is safe and number 5 looks likely too. The first one (just like 2 and 3) was directed by Gore Verbinski, who kept reuniting with Depp after his exit from the Pirates franchise. The writing team already worked together on animation classics like ""Shrek"" and ""Aladdin"". My favorite part from the script was possibly the ""saving the one shot"" storyline and the final shot was one of the highlights of the movie. I was a bit surprised the crew went according to protocol at some point as they seemed extremely loyal to Sparrow initially, but I guess it shows that you can never trust pirates. Thank God Captain Sparrow survived all these dangerous situations early on like the hail of bullets after he saved and threatened Elizabeth Swann or when he almost gets hung near the end of the film. Actually that could have been a nice ending if they hadn't done all these sequels. A bit unexpected, but somehow different.",
183,9 July 2006,friedem0n2004,8, Fun and Original,"For some time now I have been putting this movie down because it didn't seem to appealing to me when I first heard about it. Now, I know, I was so wrong to say I didn't want to see it. One reason was because I knew the sequel was on the horizon and that I felt I should see the first in order to get a sense of what Pirates was all about. I loved just about every aspect of this film. The acting was great and the story had so much to tell that I never felt like the film was long just for the sake of being long. Johnny Depp played a great pirate and so did Orlando Bloom, only in the latter part did he really shine though. The story is pretty simple but is an old tale that people of all ages will react to, for some time, as they always have. The effects were not over the top and they were done to a point where I thought I wouldn't care if I could tell the difference between live action and CG. The only thing I felt to be off balance was some of the Disney dumbness, that plagues most Disney movies and was probably put in at the request of Disney to make it more audience friendly. Overall I felt that I saw a movie and not some action flick with no backbone....ie(STORY). When I was finished, the movie gave me a sense of pride I have not had in a long time when I watch film. I have seen something I will never forget.",

""Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl"" is one of the most funny, exiting, action-filled, spectacular masterpiece of this genre! One thing over all: Johnny Depp! He is simply fantastic acting as the pirate Jack Sparrow. I consider him one of the best actors of all times because he is always perfect in almost every role (thanks to Tim Burton that discovered him!). Jack Sparrow is incredible, funny and strange, the perfect buccaneer for a movie like that. Good performance from Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley too. The photography, the sets, are perfect, and you can feel all the ""salty"" feeling of the Caribbeans in the whole movie. The story is good: a good mix of adventure and mystery, filled with action, explosions, and naval battles. The extra contents on the DVD shows how they have bought to life all that magic! The soundtrack is epic and it fit perfectly in the movie, thanks to Klaus Badelt, a real artist. In conclusion, this is an adventure masterpiece, incredibly entertaining for everyone who have a little pirate-child inside! HARRR..... where's my bottle of rum???",

186,30 November 2006,oneloveall,5, High production values do not cancel out the mostly hollow affair,"This big budget swashbuckler reinstated Hollywood's interest in pirates, reaffirmed Johhny Depp as a bankable mainstream leading man, and refocused the industry with it's surprisingly high box office performance, followed by an even more surprising (though widely regarded as inferior) net gain from it's sequel. So why did I not have half the fun as I was anticipating with The Curse of the Black Pearl? Despite having all the key ingredients at making this rousing adventure come to life, Pirates still flounders with a repetitious script, an overkill of production, and of course the general disengaged, auto-piloted mentality that one immediately associates with any massive studio release. Yes, Depp's inspired take as the woozy captain Jack Sparrow does breathe some fresh air into the stale script, though his acting, more often then not, devolves into processed caricature rather then the engaged perceptiveness we are used to seeing from an accomplished actor such as Depp. Also, the casting of uber-talented Geoffry Rush did help break up much of the monotony the time-killing script wished to parlay. Ultimately though, these elevated Hollywood performances are buried under ten tons of sheen, smoke, and explosions that could only be appropriately titled ""The Bruckheimer effect"" which finds the mega- producer, as usual, filling in any actual emotional content with a barrage of over-excessive special effects and action sequencing. Shame too, because with Depp at the helm, and the few scenes that show off the inherent humor, personality and flavor this franchise could have offered, it became obvious that this could have been so much more memorable then the hollow ride it turns out to be. As far as popcorn family entertainment goes, I can justify the massive amount of success the movie has reaped, although to elevate this movie past the point of good, into the realm of great, as many reviewers have done, seems well overrated, as I mostly spent my two and a half hours waiting for the resolution in this lackluster plot.",

Geoffrey Rush is amazing as the evil Barbosa, he was simply chilling, and I loved his accent, he also had some awesome makeup, and had one of the coolest sword fights ever with Depp, he was clearly having a ball, I loved him!. Orlando Bloom is surprisingly very good here, he was likable, had some good scenes with Depp, and didn't annoy me like usual, I dug him. Keira Knightley is incredibly gorgeous, and is amazing here as Elizabeth Swan, she adds charm to her role, had very good chemistry with Bloom, and gives one of her best performances to date!

I have eventually bought it and have watched it so many times I have lost count. I thought Johnny Depp's performance was really good and you couldn't help but love him. I also liked that the movie didn't have a lot of gore and sex in it but still kept the viewer captivated. As for T. Robertson's comment on Captain Sparrow having been under the curse too the whole time-he was not. Jack only came under the curse after having slipped a coin out of the chest after Will had been captured (You have to watch closely). That in itself was rather clever on Sparrow's part since you can't do battle with an immortal pirate and win if you are mortal. :-)This one definitely ranks in my top ten favorite movies. I hope they make another one.,

Even the visual effects are terrible and ugly to look at. And Johnny Depp's performance was bad in every way. Just because you manage to speak in a way that is hard to understand does not mean it is good acting. What was the Academy thinking have they completely lost their mind. As much as I thought Return of the King was ridiculously overrated after this abomination I am starting to respect it.

We had the strait-laced lovers, properly yearning from a distance. Then--wow--Captain Jack, and then BOOM! The Undead! Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa putting in a performance almost as wonderful as Depp's, purring his way through the delightful, witty dialogue. Jack Davenport putting in an oddly sympathetic performance as the requisite Navy stuffed-shirt (who became a full-blown heartthrob in the sequel). Kiera Knightley in the role that made her famous as the Governor's pretty young daughter, and Orlando Bloom, who hadn't yet learned how to act yet was fine as the earnest, smitten, puppyish, chivalrous, thoroughly decent and rather square Will Turner.",

199,3 August 2003,rosscinema,6, Depp adds needed ingredient,"This easily could have been your run of the mill pirate movie but thank god Johnny Depp is not only a terrific actor but one that adds real ""Character"" to his characters. Film starts out with a young boy found adrift at sea with a gold medallion around his neck and an old ship which looks like a ghost ship is spotted. Years later the boy Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is working with a blacksmith and in love with Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and she is the daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce) who would rather see his daughter marry Cmdr. Norrington (Jack Davenport). One day at port a strange sailor shows up as his small vessel sinks and he is found out to be pirate Jack Sparrow (Depp). They want to hang him but that night the town is attacked by pirates headed by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Jack has a personal beef with him. Seems as though Jack was the Captain of the ship Black Pearl but the crew performed a mutiny and left Jack on a deserted island which he escaped from. Two of the pirates grab Elizabeth because she has Will's medallion and while questioning her she says her last name is Turner. She discovers during her kidnapping that the pirates are really the walking dead and in the moonlight they appear as rotted cadavers. They think she is related to ""Boot Strap"" Turner who was a pirate that they killed and they need the blood of his offspring to become human again. Jack and Will steal a ship and go to recruit sailors so they can save Elizabeth and Jack can reap the rewards as well. This film is directed by Gore Verbinski and along with ""Mouse Hunt"" he demonstrates a real flare for lavish sets and decorum. The sets are terrific here and the special effects are pretty good as well, especially some of the underwater shots looking up at the bottom of the ships. The big problem with this film (Besides being too long) is the script. How many times did Depp get captured by either side and then have to talk his way out? And the romance between Bloom and Knightley is just so cliche. Knightley is particularly dreary. She's a fresh pretty young face but in this film her role could have been performed by any other actress and it would have been the same. She showed much more spark and left an indelible mark in the film ""Bend It Like Beckham"". Here, she's just a forgettable pretty face. What saves this film is Depp and Rush. Thankfully these two remarkable actors add so much imagination to their roles and they give the film the added flavor it badly needed. Can you imagine this film without them? Depp has stated that he played his role in the nature of a drunken Keith Richards and with the eyeliner he wears its a joy to watch him. Rush also does a good job and with that monkey on his back he seems to be having a good time. Some of the other pirates are played on a comedic level and one that stands out is the pirate with a glass eye. The film doesn't take itself seriously and this attitude works to its advantage. This film came very close to being very routine but with the performances of Depp and Rush they together save it from being predictable and stale.",

But it was one character that made this whole movie worth watching, Mr. Depp. I have to say, that without Depp, this movie would be tanking worse than Charlie's Angels 2 with an anvil attached to its foot. The eccentricities of his character Jack Sparrow provides such an energy to the film, you can't help not saying a good word about it. Every one of the characters were fairly hollow and boring, but Depp's portrayal of Sparrow provided a nexus for all of the other characters to feed off of. To say the least, this film was fairly entertaining, even if Orlando Bloom seemed completely out of his element. This is one of he few times I will say a movie was good mostly for its entertainment value. Rarely do pirate movies grace the landscape of overly expensive action movies and remakes, but this movie really hit the spot. Go to enjoy this film, because you might be surprised.",

Once again Johnny Depp does what he does so well by getting lost in the character of the infamous Jack Sparrow. Depp is sensational, this is why he's the best actor out there right now. Newcomer Kiera Knightley was a pretty face and very good in POTC and Orlando Bloom fit the bill proving his talent past Legolas of LOTR. And of course, Geoffey Rush was just so fun to hate as the grimy and nasty Barbossa, a superb villain, the summer's best villain.

This movie is a fun little ride-- not fantastic or amazing, but enjoyable.  Johnny Depp is amazing in characterizing this pirate-- is he drunk?  Is he crazy?

I've watched this movie at least a dozen times and I still can't get over how amazingly well Johnny Depp fits the part of Captain Sparrow. His gestures, facial expressions, and his script make this movie not far from a masterpiece. Honestly it took me 2 or 3 times to completely understand the plot and all the dimensions of the curse. However, watching all the extra scenes and info on the DVD made me realize how much fun the director had making the movie (when was the last time you saw a pirate movie that cool??)

He will get you through the first few viewings. Once Depp recedes, temporarily, into the background, you see the work of the good script by Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot(Aladdin, Shrek). The script gives us not one, but two pairs of bickering buffoons, a ghost story, a little romance, a little adventure, a lot of comedy, and a pirate treasure hunt. It is unpredictable. This movie might have failed without it's superbly game cast. Geoffrey Rush has almost as much fun as Depp with several good lines. Jack Davenport nails the deadpan British style of humor perfectly and is contrasted nicely by the foppish Pryce. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom are not given much to do, but they make the most of their parts. Kevin McNally makes a fine salty dog. Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Cook steal every scene they are in as a couple of silly pirate Abbott and Costello types with Agnes Burnett and Giles New as their lesser soldier counterparts.

He should have won the best Actor award for this film, but had to lose to Sean Penn, because it was a Clint Eastwood film, and it was a drama. This film would fit well for all ages both kids and parents. However, the skeleton pirates look freaky like the dead in The Lord of the Rings Part III. This film should have also won best Make-up art for Johnny Depp. The only problem with this film was some corny bits, and some parts that should have been added. This film was an out of an ordinary swas buckler than Treasure Island or any other film. The action sequences were descent, the humor was non-stoppable from Johnny Depp, Orlando bloom was the real good guy hero, Geoffrey Rush was he hateful, and slow thinking villain, and the girl was a real hotty and cuty! this film is an honesty triumph over The Lord of the Rings Part III!

The casting was perfect, the music spectacular, the special effects astounding, the story intriguing--this was as close to a perfect movie as I have seen in a long time. It's great fun, making you laugh, gasp, hold your breath, cheer, and sigh, and it appeals to all ages--I even heard grandmothers commenting on how adorable Johnny Depp was! It's not surprising that we've seen more of Keira Knightly, who gave quite a twist to the ""damsel in distress"" role. Orlando Bloom was a pleasure to look at, but his character was the only ""cardboard"" one of the lot. He did OK, and at times was great, but overall he was just overshadowed by Captain Jack, whereas the other characters seemed to hold their own. Maybe he was tired from fighting trolls (Lord of the Rings)? I've seen the movie a good two dozen times now, and it just never gets old, mostly thanks to Depp, who so deserved the Oscar for his performance. Maybe he'll manage it with one of the two sequels.

241,9 September 2003,Dockelektro,8, Arrrrrr!,"Great to see that careful planning, structuring and audience studying pay off sometimes. The audience can at times be a strange beast, and can sink pictures in the same turf where others have been glorified. But Disney couldn't allow this movie to suffer the fate of Roman Polanski's ""Pirates"" or ""Cutthroat Island"". First major rule: stick to what you know, and always trust the school of Hollywood -  thus, create a buddy-buddy formula, add the love interest, and then create a baddie, or even better, an army of baddies to go chase the heroes. The cornerstones of the typical american blockbuster are all right there, splattered on the screen, just pick them out. Second major rule: give the audience the very thing they're looking for when in the movies - exactly those things that they're not expecting. So assume the pirate theme and adapt it to the 21st century - and then come the bombastic the special effects. These two rules are usually gold, and when you tackle a movie genre that hasn't been touched for almost ten years, it isn't difficult to give people what they want to see. But this apparent ease of thought would trap Disney, so thank God for brilliant ideas - and one brilliant actor. Johnny Depp steals the show right from his unforgettable entrance, and never thinks of allowing some space for other things to provide comic relief. And neither do the filmmakers, and the public. As Jack Sparrow, the gallery of Depp-ish weirdness is complete with a full-on, iconic buckaneer, brilliantly crossing pirate stereotype with pop culture in a performance of rare dedication and method for a summer blockbuster. The result is the most memorable character of the picture, and also the entire blockbuster season. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" could be in many ways another flop, but the producers made this movie by studying everything that made the others sink to the bottom. And also did Jerry Bruckheimer, whose ""Pearl Harbor"" left more bitterness in his mouth than memories in the entire audience. A refined sense of style, bombastic CGI skelletons and a script that only feels muddled when it seeks help in some of the chapters of the ""Hollywood book of screenwriting"", make this a winner, and one of the best popcorn-munchers of the year. Expect Peter Weir's / Russell Crowe's ""Master and Commander"", expect ""Pirates of the Caribbean 2"", and most probably seafaring adventures are back into the silver screen. Ahoy!",

Johnny Depp was born to play Jack Sparrow, and the rest of the cast, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce, are perfect as well as the rest of the supporting cast. The glaring mistake is Keira Knightley, and I rated this movie a 9 instead of 10 because of her. I'm sure this is an unpopular opinion, but I think she's a terrible actress. She just looks totally out of place, and doesn't fit the part of an old-world pirate movie. She doesn't seem to embrace the character she's playing, instead it always seems like she's acting instead of living the part.

This film makes me appreciate all those Flynn, Power, Derek and Payne movies which managed to capture the period and flavor of bygone Romantic eras with much greater dispatch and lower budgets.

The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of those summer time movies which you have to be in the mood to view and many years later finally... that mood had arrived for me. On the whole I was not left disappointed as it kept me hooked through its swash- buckling antics and I can see how the angles were curbed to keep this a good family film. The plot was fairly straight forward with our anti-hero pirate trying to recover his ship back whilst taking revenge on a group of super natural foes along with the entire naval fleet and the meeting a few characters along the way . The special affects were very good , not to mention the stunts and the sword play all brilliant although its never really taken to the level I had hoped for but hey again this is a family film!!! Jhonny Depp was the man who kept me in my seat , whether it be the action or the catchy one liners he makes it very apparent why he is one of the most versatile actors to have emerged onto the big screen. Orlando Bloom although I am not a fan of his he pulled his weight through out the film very well indeed UNLIKE in Troy where he was nothing short of an annoying pep-squeak and I really enjoyed Keira Knightley's performance through out the film (not just eye candy)and every body made full use of the scenery to the brilliant make-up and costumes really made it worth while. Too conclude The Curse of The Black Pearl is one of those films which are worth a check at on summer's day with your family or worth a rental if your looking for a bit of light action/fantasy I mean I may just be a little too old for Pirates now days and the action was not taken to the level I had hoped for but instead it was saved by brilliant performances all round.

That is not the case as the poor attempts at jokes do not work. Johnny Depp probably deserved his Golden Globe nomination, not his Oscar nomination though. His character, along with everyone elses, is one-dimensional and conforms to stereotypes. Bloom plays Legolas very well to say the setting has changed. the other actors are fairly decent in their roles.

Good directing by Gore Verbinski and well done acting! This movie is recommended for all pirate lovers and other people who just like movies with loads of good actors. Johnny Depp is by far my best actor, but that does not mean that the others aren't. This movie is probably one of the best in the world and is very, very well done. The ships and battles are incredible. The ghosts are very realistic and funny (the guy with the glass eye) and a amazing sword duel to finish. Outstanding!",

262,1 May 2005,tinkerbellem,10, Get ready for a swashbuckling adventure!,"Before this film i had never heard of Johnny Depp, Keira Knightly or Geoffery Rush but i had heard of Orlando Bloom. I had never even seen the trailer to 'Pirates of the Caribbean'! My sister first saw the film and told me so much about it and told me that I really should go and see it with her... I kept on saying no because it just didn't appeal to me. I then spoke to other people about it who said it was great so i finally decided to go and see it. From start to finish i was taken on a swashbuckling adventure! It had everything that a movie should have... love, comedy, adventure, a kidnapping and cursed pirates after treasure. The film was mainly carried by the fantastic Johnny Depp... playing the slightly drunk Captain Jack Sparrow who's main mission in the film is to get back his ship 'the Black Pearl'. However, he ends up taking on board Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) a blacksmith who is in love with the Governers daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly). Elizabeth is kidnapped by Pirates and it is up to Jack and Will to save her. However the Pirates are cursed and are neither living nor dead...they must repay their blood otherwise they will be cursed forever. So as you can see there is a lot to go by on the film. Can Jack Sparrow be trusted? Will they reach Elizabeth before it is too late? Will the pirates ever be rid of the dreaded curse? Watch this film as it is perfect for anyone! This film is one of the best epics every made! Watch it...you will not be disappointed!",

He went back to basics, hired the best in the business and came up with pure escapist entertainment that works on every level. THE ROCK with an eye patch! Didn't hurt his cause either, that Johnny Depp handed in this once-in-a-career performance as Master Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow - part cockney, part Gilbert Grape, all Rock-Star - the most endearing rogue this side of the Jolly Roger! Geoffrey Rush's turn as Barbossa, a supernatural `Captain Hook' gone feral and swapping his parrot for an occasionally digitised monkey-with-attitude is given arguably his best role since Helfgott!  Bloom also does just that.Erroll Flynn coming along nicely! Meanwhile, the painfully corsetted Miss Knightley balances the film's romantic interest, Elizabeth Swann, beautifully - somewhere between Ripley and GI Jane.Toss in a truly great script that bridges the gulf so well between pirate chatter and teenage attention-span and you're looking at a seriously brilliant off the wall two and whatever hours of cornball whimsy that wouldn't put a harmful psychological dent in a five year old's psyche.",

Perhaps I should not have expected more, given that it's just a Disney SFX vehicle with a bankable lead, but I thought this fell far short of the hype.

272,25 August 2004,colonel_green,10, An epic adventure; my favourite film of 2003.,"The first time I saw ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" in theatres, in the summer of 2003, I knew that it was the first of many viewings.  I ended up seeing it four times in theatres, and I then acquired the DVD.  PotC is a truly great action-adventure film, perhaps the best pirate movie ever made (although that genre hasn't faired well of late). Johnny Depp does an iconic turn as Jack Sparrow, the bizarre anti-hero that captured the audience's imagination, and earned Depp an Oscar nomination (he should have won, if you asked me).  Sparrow is a truly unique creation, and he overshadows everything else in the film.  Doing his best to match Depp in scenery chewing is Geoffrey Rush, playing another of his memorable villains, Captain Barbossa.  Somewhat more subdued are Orlando Bloom, Jack Davenport, and the stunningly beautiful Keira Knightley (in the role that put her on the map).  Knightley is just about the only woman in the production, but she is a great screen presence; hopefully she will have a long career ahead of her. My favourite scene is the dinner scene onboard the Black Pearl, where Elizabeth sits down with Barbossa and he gives her food to eat; unable to enjoy the food himself, Barbossa draws an absurd amount of enjoyment from watching her eat and drink; he then follows it up with an excellent monologue, one of the most memorable film speeches I've ever seen. I give ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" a 10/10.",

274,14 August 2003,stamper,8, Entertaining yet slightly shallow and formulatic summer blockbuster that only surprises in the acting department,"Pirates of the Caribbean is your traditional summer blockbuster: it has good special effects, a lot of action, a few pretty faces and not too much of a story. But that is not all. It was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, which usually means that it is very high on the entertaining side and nothing more. Pirates of the Carribean fits that profile almost exactly. It is entertaining (although slightly longish when the cave is visited for the second time), that's for sure, but the makers of this film have succeeded in doing something that I had not yet seen in a summer flick of this magnitude (or maybe I have simply forgotten). They have chosen a cast, that was so superb on the one side, that it almost all of the other actors became mere puppets. Yes folks, I am talking about Johnny Depp. He is just amazing as Jack Sparrow. It is not that he is amazingly funny or something, but he just manages to surprise you over and over again. Then there is the accent and of course not to forget that strange way of movement he has throughout the film. Jack Sparrow might be quirky but he is not in your face' quirky and that is something I also liked about that character. Johnny Depp ruled as Jack Sparrow and outshone all but one of his co-stars who became mere puppets in the Jack Sparrow Show'. The exception was (of course) Geoffrey Rush, who was very solid and did a good Job as Captain Barbossa. The rest of the cast, well I've said it and I'm not sorry for telling the truth: you acted decent, but in the presence of Mr.Depp you faded into the background.",

Which is really what this movie is meant for anyway, the kids of summer looking for a good swash buckling Disney flick so they can play pretend pirates in the back yard with their friends.

I not only drool over him, his talent is true and original. How many sexy males do you know that would or could pull off a very believable rendition of a punk-rock pirate named Jack Sparrow. The plot is almost perfectly mending to all genre's and pulls anyone in by its diverse levels of movie goers. If you like action, comedy, and anything with Johnny Depp, this is the one to see.

291,2 July 2007,galensaysyes,2," The big conglomerates have pretty much driven the little guys out of business, you know?...Oh, the movie, right.","Johnny Depp must work a potent magic on his admirers: by its power he's able to communicate to them, and to them alone, the character he has it in his head that he's portraying. The rest of us have to do a good deal of guessing, since the actor goes only a little way in manifesting his purpose by means of the normal external signs, e.g. facial expressions, body language, tones of voice. Lacking these to go by, I hazard that in this movie he thinks he's impersonating a would-be buccaneer who's generally too drunk, lazy, incompetent, or good-natured to carry off his boasted predations: a role for a W. C. Fields or Wallace Beery, not a performer with the look and the aura of a spoiled altar-boy twenty years past his prime. The star's deficiency might have been compensated for in some measure by intelligent casting of the leading lady; but the one we have here is Keira Knightley, doing her usual, i.e. wanly striking poses for an imaginary photo shoot. The villain, Geoffrey Rush, supplies the color and panache the other two lack; but there's not enough of him to go around. The movie is rather at pains to present itself as a piece of good fun; but for me it was a piece of hard work, all on account of the director (the same one who bumbled up the American ""Ring""). He appears to have one virtue: shooting all the script he has, so that all the pieces are there, as they often are not in films these days. But the pieces are nearly all wrong: in the staging, the perspectives and proportions are so far off what one might imagine in reading the script (or any of its published story-izings) that one almost has to revisualize the movie as it goes to get what it's about. And the script, which is a mishmash at best, is confusing in places. The first scene ends with the pirate ship bearing down on its apparent target...and then what? Pondering this enigma distracted me from subsequent developments for a good hour or so; not that they compelled much interest in themselves. I feel a gallon of ill will toward this movie: as a product for sale, which is all it is (it's a lot farther from being a work of art than the amusement ride that inspired), it's a piece of inferior merchandise, with its seams still unfinished. Yet buyers seemed not to see that. Depp's magic at work again?",

I'm not completely sure he deserved the Oscar nomination for it but hey, he finally got the public recognition as a result so it's all good.

Johnny Depp was hilarious and portrayed a unique and lovable pirate. Geoffrey Rush played an excellent adversary who was both sinister and entertaining. Orlando Bloom played his part of a devoted lover wonderfully despite many people's opinions that he was weak and too lovey-dovey. The plot was interesting and captivating, and although I found a loophole, I think it was purposeful as they are making a sequel. Wonderful special effects and sets helped to make this movie excellent. Wonderful direction from Gore Verbinski held this movie together and an awesome score by Klaus Badelt accompanied the entire movie very well.

This movie is a must-buy. The casting, acting, direction and cinematography/choreography were all almost flawless. The special effects were well-done. Disney's getting better at the CGIs. (Hooray.)

However, Johnny Depp's rancid Captain Jack makes on long for the likes of Robert Newton, Anthony Quinn, and the pirate heroes of the 50's such as Flynn and Tyrone Power. The ""evil dead"" type special effects were an unnecessary distraction and the historical continuity was ludicrous.  Some characters were circa 16th and 17th century (Orlando Bloom with his Musketeer garb at the end) while the British troops were definitely late 18th century as in the American Revolution.

I did enjoy the boats and sets a lot. However, I did not like Orlando Bloom and found him dull and irritating. Keira Knightley was clearly just chosen as a pretty face, since she wasn't too exciting, either.  It's a shame to see someone as talented as Depp paired up with two such inadequate actors. The film itself was long and without real substance.  I did enjoy the ""cameos"" from specific parts of the WDW ride, though. ",

One that you could go on again and again and again.  Every aspect of the movie was extremely entertaining. As soon as Johnny Depp enters, you know that there's gonna be a hell of a performance. And there was.  That guy can play anything and I really wouldn't mind if he played a pirate for the rest of his life!  His ability to put on almost any accent for any role is absolutely amazing.  He doesn't slip up even for a second. Orlando Bloom looked really good, Keira Knightley looked really pretty and this role suited her well. Geoffrey Rush was amazing, as always. The direction was excellent and the dialogues were hilarious. Very highly recommended! *****/*****",

""Pirates"" (1986) by Roman Polanski enters this category, a project whose preparation was long and arduous and in the end, it was a very impersonal amount and Polanski's absolute nadir of his career with the desultory ""What?"" (1972). Then, ""Cutthroat Island"" (1995) was a contender for the genre but ended in a financial fiasco. Nearly a decade later, Gore Verbinski with whom, a good majority of cine buffs had unearthed in him palpable skills in directing with the chilling ""the Ring"" (2002) and under the command of the Disney firm embarked on a new ship. Direction: the pirate island with the well-intentioned will to restore once for all the reputation of the pirate movie. Unfortunately, he didn't arrive at the end of his trip. His ship fell through. It was a profitable blockbuster for the mighty producer Jerry Bruckheimer who once again lined his pockets. Artistically, well let's be as nice as possible and it will be hard because I had relied on the director of ""the Ring"" to rejuvenate the pirate movie and to deliver a solid entertaining film.

After dealing with her gushing over the male leads and for a few days and constant bugging by my brother to see the film I eventually went with no expectations.

Well, someday arrived tonight and I must say, I am not impressed. Nope. Not really. Johnny Depp has some funny moments but two hours of him acting like that is too much. And Captain Jack Sparrow is barely a pirate. A leader of men? Give me a break. He's pathetic. There's some good acting from Keira Knightly and Geoffrey Rush and Jack Davenport, but Depp's hammyness is borderline mental and helps ruin this movie. And what's with the CGI skeleton pirates?

Jack Sparrow placed emphases on his ship, the Black Pearl until his partner's betrayal. He is sentenced to death until a pirate raid results in the kidnapping of the Governor's daughter. They seek a medallion that can lift a curse. Directed by Gore Verbinski who previously made The Ring and The Mexican. He brings a sense of youthful enthusiasm that works. Johnny Depp delivers a hilarious scene stealing performance as Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush is fierce as his ex partner. He is the evil pirate leader seeking the medallion. Its power is never properly explained but they are seen as skeletons under the moonlight. Orlando Bloom plays a weapons manufacturer. Keira Knightley goes beyond damsel in distress as the Governor's daughter. She is involved in a mesmerizing sequence where she is hurled aimlessly from skeleton to skeleton when she realizes the horror that is upon her. It is obvious that she and Bloom will unite. Zoe Saldana plays a female pirate who joins Bloom and sets out to confront Sparrow for stealing her ship. Special effects are best when the moonlight turns normality into a skeletal frame of relentless horror. Score: 8 / 10",

Why oh why, though is this movie rated pg-13?  Seems to me it should be pg easily.  I mean pg means parental guidance and I do believe many eight year olds would love it.  Just seems the ratings board has forgotten that movies like Jaws and all the earlier James Bond movies were rated pg.  I just think they under use that rating to a ridiculous extreme these days.

There wasn't to many moments in this one when he was on screen that didn't make me at least chuckle.  He really made the film for me, though the rest of the cast was good to with Geoffrey Rush as the bad guy and Orlando Bloom doing excellent jobs as well. The female lead was great too.  This one though was just a purely fun movie to watch.  The scenery was great too on the open seas.  The only thing I had problems with are some plot points and the movie did run a bit long.  I still am not quite sure why they needed the one guys blood and there was something else that didn't quite fit together as well, like what was up with the compass, but these are minor problems I had with it and in no way do they diminish the enjoyment I had watching this one.  Great swordfights in this one as well, as I love a good sword fight in a movie.  This one is also good for the whole family, and I am still wondering why it was rated PG and not PG-13 as I think the ratings board these days is a bit crazy.

364,3 April 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, One heck of a ride.,"'Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl (2003)' is a really good time. It's a swashbuckling adventure with a pitch-perfect tone and an eclectic set of memorable characters, each as important as the last. Depp's performance is a tightrope walk and he never really wobbles, portraying his 'rock star' pirate as if it were the role he was born to play. Jack Sparrow is an interesting lead because you never know what he's thinking. He double-crosses just about everyone but remains likeable because he's just so good at talking his way out of things and, eventually, some of those double-crosses turn out to be triple-crosses. He has a moral centre, even if it's well-hidden. His adversary is similarly skilled with his silver tongue. However, Hector Barbossa doesn't seem to have a modicum of moral fibre and that's what makes him such a compelling villain. The other factor in that is Rush's fantastic portrayal; he chews the scenery like it's his last meal and he's absolutely spot-on. As is the phenomenal music, which effortlessly evokes everything you could want from a story like this. The narrative takes our heroes and villains through a compelling 'cursed gold' plot and places them in several stand-out set-pieces that are sure to put a smile on your face. That final moment between Sparrow and Barbossa is just sublime. The entire film is just a blast throughout. It's suitably pulpy yet always sincere. It's also chuckle-worthy at times and genuinely suspenseful at others. It works so brilliantly because it's all character-driven, right down to the last sword stroke. It's a hugely entertaining blockbuster. Its balance between practical and digital effects is fantastic, too. 8/10",

This young girl is Keira Knightly, (Elizabeth Swann) who notices someone is floating on a raft in the waters below and summons help to rescue him; Elizabeth then proceeds to steel a metal object from around his neck and never says a word about this incident for many years in the future. The rescued young boy was Johnny Depp (Jack Sparrow) who has a secret past relating to his father and his associations with men on the seas who had Cross Bones and a Skelton as their flag. There is plenty of sword crashing steel and creatures resembling Draculas along with things you can not even imagine. Errold Flynn would never be able to complete with Johnny Depp, but Errold was good way back in the 1930's and 40's.",

The movie as a whole is quite amusing, the action is well handled, especially the highly entertaining sword duel between Depp and Bloom and it's really pretty imaginative for something that was created just to capitalize on the success of an amusement park ride.",
371,5 November 2014,brdlybaum,1, I Can Not Believe How Many People Have Rated This Drivel So Highly!,"I can not remember the last time I saw a Disney film that was as bad as this is. Why do people who have had no acting lessons and are not fully trained actors continually get acting work at the expense of those that have been fully trained and therefore can act? Johnny Depp is proof of point of someone who has absolutely no ability to act whatsoever due to having had no lessons in how to act and is the complete opposite of fully trained and yet he keeps getting work in front of someone who is fully trained! The rest of the cast did rather well with the dreadful script, the storyline was almost non-existent, and didn't do anything remotely new. If half of The scenes where buckles were swashed and cut the rest shorter there still would have been far more than enough swash buckling to suit everyone that went to see the film. At over two hours long half an hour could have been taken out and it still would have been far too long! Johnny Depp's English accent was....well....let's just say it was obvious that it was an American trying to speak in and with an English accent, unlike Kevin Costner when he did Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves!

Way back in 2003, while on an island (San Juan Island, WA to be exact,) my then- boyfriend and I checked out the only movie theatre on the isle. Personally, I didn't want to see Pirates of the Caribbean, but it was either that or Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde since the movie theatre only had two screens.

This movie is something kids and adults can enjoy, but it doesn't excel to something more than that. The trailer for this movie was more better than the movie itself, but for going in a direction where it's watchable for the whole family. It's done pretty well for the most part, although it comes off a bit silly at times because of it and not really in a positive way either. I personally didn't really like the humor in this although some of the audience might like it. Johnny Depp has created a iconic character because of this movie, and he liked this character a lot himself. Jack Sparrow is a fun and interesting character to watch on screen and is the character that stood out the most. The other cast members did really well with their roles especially Geoffrey Rush who plays Captain Barbossa. The movie was fun a ride, however it got pretty old after it got shown in school way too many times.

In terms of how the film is constructed, the nature of his role is interesting, as there's an almost conventional story without him: a romantic lead, a beautiful, feisty heroine, a love rival and an evil villain account for most of the plot without Sparrow even getting a mention. Sparrow is more like an annoying child than anything, cropping up and getting in the way, pursuing his own ambitions and desires with childish abandon. As is often said, he really is the ""world's worst pirate"", scarcely meriting being taken seriously; but instead of just being a comic extra, he's actually the film's central character. It's hard to imagine the story working without Depp in the role, but fortunately, it doesn't have to. Sit back and smile.",

I saw it a few days after the release here in Israel, and the theater was much more populated than with the previous summer movies, and the reaction of the public was more sympathetic. I think the reason is that the film does not pretend at all to be more than it is - Disney-level entertainment. When you enter a Disney park you leave out any big cultural experience expectation, you get in childhood mood and enjoy the ride. Do the same with 'Pirates', and you may enjoy it. Backed up by some decent acting, and with special effects that will fight for the Oscar with the Terminator stuff, the film is decent entertainment - probably some of best you can expect from the US studios this summer. 7/10 on my personal scale.",

Well it wasn't a mistake and Disney knocked one out of the park with this incredible swashbuckling adventure that completely invigorates the ""Pirate"" film, not that I can think of any others at the moment. Pirates is possibly one of the greatest adventure films I've ever sat through. Completely unashamed of it's 2 1/2 hour time frame and although still to this die hyped as a kids movie it's pretty brutally violent at times with freaky undead pirates and plenty of sword play and guns blazing.

Without Depp, Pirates is just another bad summer block-buster movie with too little plot and too much special effects trying to cover it up. I'm a bit amazed that the Oscars saw fit to nominate his performance - one of the boldest, riskiest acting jobs ever allowed in a summer release. I know all the accolades went to Sean Penn's overdone performance in Mystic River. But, I'd give the nod to Depp for single-handedly pulling this movie into the enjoyable category.",
382,15 July 2019,arthur_tafero,4, good try but no cigar; Curse of the Black Pearl is a Cheap Imitation,"Let us quickly review the actors in this film, Depp, Knightley, Bloom, Price and Rush; all of which have done much better work in previous films. In this film, however, a silly pirate movie about zombies that has no logic, science or sex, so must be attached somehow to the Disney fantasy world, is , at best, mediocre eye candy. Depp plays a bisexual pirate with effeminate traits, but serious sexual dysfunction; most likely caused by his alcoholism. Knightly was almost convincing, until she didn't have sex with Depp after an all night orgy of everything else. Bloom is still stuck in his Lord of the Rings Personna, and is the weakest actor in this group, Pryce has to play the ""father"" role, and basically gets a hand job (which he eventually defeats) in this film, and Rush seems to have the best time of all, having fun playing a despicable pirate in charge of a literally skeleton crew. The film is sometimes funny in the beginning, bogs down in the middle, and is about a half hour or more too long. Strictly for children and teens high on cheap beer.",

It's such an entertaining film, I've seen it many times and I still thoroughly enjoy it every time, the story and characters are all executed very well and we are never really sure where the next scene is headed, which is great to see in a movie, you never really know what's going to happen. My only problem is that they tended to hold back on the scary moments, just when the film starts to feel like a bit of a horror and it's sending a shiver down your spine, it would make a joke or do something to completely lighten the mood of these scenes, which I do understand because it wanted to be as kid friendly as possible, but these parts would have a much better effect had they been more thrilling. The cast are of course a major part of what makes this film so great, there is excellent chemistry between Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush is unrecognizeable as his character, but the star of the show is, without a doubt, Johnny Depp, it will come as no surprise with a character as flamboyant and likable as Captain Jack Sparrow that he manages to steal every scene he's in, certainly one of the most beloved movie characters of all time, for all the right reasons.

There is the romance, there are the fight scenes, there are the ghost/horror elements, there are the cute comedy bits that all make up for a rather fun, entertaining film for everyone. Johnny Depp almost steals the show with his anti-hero antics. The movie ultimately stands up to honest scrutiny for all characters for the most part by the end, though perhaps Barbossa could have been even a more complex character making the movie even more dramatic and riveting. The climax avoids the usual melt-down to action and blustery fury, using instead a more moderate and superior ending device. Overall, Pirates rates eight stars out of ten.",

396,9 August 2013,johnnyboyz,5, Flailing the high seas.,"I suppose the fact that Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl depicts a sword fight between two immortals that lasts for several minutes is really the clincher that the film does not amount to much more than a bit of throwaway nonsense. The scene, wherein it is readily identified by both parties that the futility of their actions can be equated only to their skills in sword fighting in the first place, epitomises just how much director Gore Verbinski is enjoying himself and just how much his audience aren't. For many years, the notion of what happens when an unstoppable force meets and immovable object has befuddled physicists; it may very well have to take second stage to the conundrum of what happens when two invulnerable forces do battle to the death. Do not think there is any attempt at solving such a riddle, for the director is merely pleased with the fact he's bringing all of this spectacle to life in the first place. It falls to all the usual Hollywood mistakes and annoyances: visual and oral bombardment consisting of grandeur tracking shots put to a booming score, while the completely ill-judged decision to cut back and forth from harmless comedy to scenes of a massacre represents American event-movie directing at its very worst. Like most of its ilk, it's too long and while there is some heady adventure in there at times, the film is too bad too often to actually get too excited about.",

410,3 January 2022,GusherPop,10, Depp Owns the seas,"""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" a movie that charms the audience and then outstays its welcome. Although the ending leaves open the possibility of a sequel, the movie feels like it already includes the sequel; maybe that explains the double-barreled title. It's a good thing that Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp are on hand to jack up the acting department. Their characters, two world-class goofballs, keep us interested even during entirely pointless swordfights. Consider how boring it would have been if Depp had played the role straight, as an Errol Flynn or Douglas Fairbanks (Sr. Or Jr.) might have. To take this material seriously would make it unbearable. Capt. Sparrow's behavior is so rococo that other members of the cast actually comment on it. And yet because it is consistent and because you can never catch Depp making fun of the character, it rises to a kind of cockamamie sincerity. Geoffrey Rush is relatively subdued--but only by contrast. His Barbossa, whose teeth alone would intimidate a congregation of dentists, brings gnashing to an art form. Only the film's PG-13 rating prevents him from doing unthinkable things to the heroine, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), whose blood, it is thought, can free the captain and his crew from the Curse of the Black Pearl. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is ""based on"" the theme park ride at Disney World, which I have taken many times.

The film is based on the Disney attraction ride, and the movie does not derail from its voyage of cinematic cleverness. Johnny Depp stars as Jack Sparrow, a charismatic pirate who is on a quest to regain his old ship `The Black Pearl'. Johnny be very good with his oscar-worthy performance as Sparrow. With this work, Johnny has paid his Depps I mean debts to those critics who have condemned him for not selecting roles in more commercially appealing films. It is one of the best acting pieces of the year! Co-star Orlando Bloom is blooming into a star with his role as the Blacksmith on a quest to rescue the Governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann. Speaking of which, Keira Knightleys breakthrough performance as Elizabeth was also commendable. Geoffrey Rush as the evil pirate continues to demonstrate his scene-stealing ability to portray scoundrel antagonists. Director Gore Verbinski provided just the right touch of Goreism for it to be a Gore candidate as the best film he has directed. `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is the pirate film for me!

I'm not a big fan of Johnny Depp, but I will say that he was the correct pick for this character, I've really taken issue with how he represents characters before (Charlie and the chocolate factory), but this time I think he did a good job. His character is complicated because on one hand, he is someone we root for and someone we're amused by because of his humorous nature and personality, and then on the other hand, he's a flawed character that steals and cheats others. But it's a whole lot of fun to watch Johnny Depp plays this humorous captivating character, hence his academy award nomination. We are also introduced to Will, played by the ever handsome Orlando Bloom. Will is one of the most commendable characters you'll ever see, he's a noble charming character who everyone has no choice but to root for. And then we have Keira Knightly playing Elizabeth. She plays Blooms love interest. But what I loved about her role is that she's isn't just some female for Bloom, she is not a damsel in distress. Yes, it's great to see her and Will fall in love and to see their great romantic chemistry, but it's also awesome to see Elizabeth stand up for herself and take charge in different scenes. She played her in a very bad ass way, which makes it so much fun to watch. The plot of course revolves around pirates invading and these characters I've told you about going up against them. There's more to it than that of course but that's the basic overall plot. I really enjoy watching this now ever famous film. It deserves the positive reception it received when it came out. 8/10 for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.",
418,27 May 2020,fernandoschiavi,8," Verbinski takes the script not seriously and bets on a tone of humor and adventure, without forgetting, of course, the ""pinches"" of horror","""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was a major revolution in 2003 when it made a perfect combination of comedy and action combined with a theme in almost nothing explored until then: pirates. Obviously, this combination could only yield an excellent adventure across the seven seas in skilled hands. Based on the Pirates of the Caribbean toy from Walt Disney Parks and Resorts theme parks. Jay Wolpert developed a script based on the toy in 2001 and Stuart Beattie rewrote it in early 2002. At that time, producer Jerry Bruckheimer became involved in the project; he made Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio work on the script, adding a supernatural curse to the plot. Gore Verbinski signed on to direct Pirates of the Caribbean because he was attracted by the idea of using modern technology to resurrect a genre that had disappeared after the Golden Age of Hollywood, and by remembering his childhood memories of the toy, thinking that the film was an opportunity to pay tribute to the attraction's ""scary and fun"" tone.",

I'm not exactly sure just how, but somehow. Perhaps because it was produced by Disney. It seemed to have some of that usual Disney ""insipidness"" that tends to take the edge off of otherwise excellent movies. Some kind of pandering to an unseen and irrelevant ""political correctness"". I don't know exactly. It is  great for kids, my 10 year old just loved every second, and when you have kids, that counts for everything. I personally enjoyed it, but I wouldn't sit through it again.

When film began to become prevalent with audiences, there were also several films made that revolved around these individuals. The life of a pirate is one of that many seek to obtain even though most would deny it. Who wouldn't want to sail around the world's oceans plundering with your friends and having a good time provided no rules? It sounds like a lot of fun. Surprisingly, as dark as this particular career can get for some people, Disney is able to portray the fictitious world of pirates where it may not be all fun and games, but it still looks like a blast (pardon the pun). There isn't any element that feels out of place.",

I felt like I was watching Richard Simmons in a pirate costume!  I think I would have liked this movie better had it been more of a horror film instead of an adventure movie.  I think it would have worked scary.  I would have liked Depp's character to have been tougher.  I guess this movie is okay if you like pirate films, but it just wasn't what I wanted.  I would love to see it redone with alot of horror, but I know I'm dreaming.  So, see it for the costumes, but don't expect it to be a great film.",

However, how can you point that out when this happens to also be one featuring ghost pirates too? It goes for effect and excitement more than anything else and as far as a swashbuckling adventure goes it's as good a one you'll find. The score's terrific and the writers, director, and supporting cast are all strong, but we all know what brings this movie up from just decent is Johnny Depp. To say he's the most memorable part of the movie is an understatement-he is the movie.

Understandably, seeing as how a movie from Disney based off of a ride from their theme park didn't sound as if it'd provide the strongest foundation for a feature film. It wasn't until my girlfriend of the time convinced me to watch it that I finally agreed and I'm really glad I did. This movie was nothing close to what I was expecting, blowing away every expectation I'd set for it...it was funny, exciting, engaging, and wasn't as PC or family-friendly as your average Walt Disney film. The story follows Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) as he embarks on a quest to reclaim his ship, the Black Pearl, from his mutinous first mate, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). What Jack doesn't know is that Barbossa and his crew have since acquired a curse, giving them immortality...at a price.

I think Johnny Depp got his first Oscar nomination for it. In my opinion, he definitely deserved it. Johnny Depp is mostly the reason why I gave Pirates of the Caribbean such a high rating. Not only is it an amazing film, Johnny Depp and Geoffry Rush make it very interesting. Depp and Rush play Jack Sparrow and Captain Barbossa, two rival pirates who are still having at it after so many years. Both Rush and Depp are great. The Plot: A medallion needs the blood of William Turner, who's father put the curse on this ship. So Will teams up with the greatest pirate legend, Jack Sparrow, to save his love Elizabeth from the crew and stop the curse. I love Pirates of the Caribbean. I actually love the entire trilogy, though the third film was weakish. The original film was the best without a doubt. The film wasn't a critical success, though it was nominated for five Oscars.

443,18 August 2003,CitizenCaine,7," Good, Rollicking Fun","The film was about 2 hours and 20 minutes, which is getting rarer to see these days with all the arguing between studios and directors about which cut of films we see in theaters. The movie wisely does not ever take itself seriously, as pirate movies have been done many times before far better. The granddaddy of them all is The Sea Hawk, 1940, with Errol Flynn; there are subtle tips of the hat to this film in Pirates Of The Caribbean, such as the ""sea monkey."" The Crimson Pirate, 1952, with Burt Lancaster is a close second; there is a real nice ode to Burt Lancaster & Nick Cravat in this film. Tyrone Power in The Black Swan, 1942, is also very good. There have been very few pirate movies made in the last 20 years and those that have been made, well... which may be why audiences are welcoming this film so well this summer. Johnny Depp doesn't hurt either to get the targeted demographic into theaters. Orlando Bloom doesn't have a lot to do, playing second fiddle. Geoffrey Rush is almost choking on all that scenery he chews on. Jonathan Pryce plays his part appropriately as the really important person, who is an easily duped oaf. Keira Knightly is ravishing as the girl that needs ravishing. The funny inside joke about the corset scene is that she is extremely rail thin; I would be willing to wager the costumers had to construct a corset that had to appear to be pulled tight around her as none probably existed in real life. I thought the plot about the curse was pretty lame, but it was consistent with the overall preposterousness of the goings-on. It also served as an excuse to provide the real neat special effects, which are obligatory in any ""A"" budget film these days. The soundtrack contains a jolly good rousing score, which could rival the best of Erich Wolfgang Korngold. I suppose it's asking too much, but I would have loved to see more odes to the pirate movies of yesterday, such as those I mentioned above. For those of you that don't know what I'm referring to, see the above mentioned films. *** of 4 stars.",
444,15 December 2022,dasa108,1, Well technically but zero in originality.,"This is a film that is the sum of every possible cliché to make a film: there is an anti hero that will have to put on the right side, there are proxies who could never have had that behavior for a few centuries ago, the Villains or are silly or predictable and the general comedy tone makes this package that we have seen in a thousand films digestible. The film is well done but the big problem is that little does to offer something that has a drop of originality. And the big problem is that. You cannot insult the viewer with a design product whose only purpose is to bill while we as hostages accept as beggars what they give us. Technically it is good but as an artistic and original product it is despicable.",

The first thing which went through my head was, oh God, please not another pirate movie, especially one made for the kids during the summer holidays. My fears were confirmed when the Disney logo appeared at the end of the trailer. There was no way in hell I was going to see this movie. Then, people started telling me about a certain guy called Johnny Depp. Now, I have never seen a movie with Johnny Depp in it, so I wasn`t really moved when people told me that he was the best thing in this movie. Anyway, lately a friend and I decided to rent the movie just to see what it was like. I watched it and I must say, it IS a Disney pirate movie made for the kids for summer. However, it is also a very entertaining movie, in parts. I can see why it has done very well at the box offices around the world and why people keep going back to see it. If you haven`t seen this movie, the fact that it is a Disney movie should not discourage you, and the fact that it has pirates in it, well, in all fairness it is one of the best pirate movies I have seen, well worth a try, you won`t be disappointed.",

Oh sure, Middle Earth is another place too, but it's not exactly fun, is it. I enjoy looking at it, but do I really want to walk through the cinema screen into the battle at Helm's Deep? I think not. Escapism. Sure, Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush give the ultimate performances in it. But lots of things about this movie worked for me. The set design, the special effects, the weather...and tiny little details that you wouldn't miss if they weren't there, but which added to the movie big time. If I had to list a favourite movie of all time, I used to say The Princess Bride, or the first Matrix or whatever mood I am in.

First of all, the acting leaves you wishing you were in the shoes of a pirate yourself, whether you are on the good side or the bad. Personally, this was the performance of Johnny Depp's career, though he's had many, none were as recognizable or as fun to imitate as Captain Jack Sparrow. The cast is superb, the action is endless, and the comedy is more than funny. I feel this movie deserved to at least win ONE Academy Award.

The come upon a ship, ransacked and burned by pirates. Suddenly, Elizabeth spots an unconscious boy, Will Turner, in the water. When Will is brought onto the ship and laid upon the deck, Elizabeth spots a gold medallion around his neck. Fearing the authorities will arrest the boy as a pirate, Elizabeth steals the medallion. Years later, when Will and Elizabeth grow up, they share an adventure involving the medallion, an unearthly pirate crew and `the curse of the Black Pearl'. `All opinions are vanity ' including my own. Well, I guess I better prepare myself to be clobbered once again for trashing a movie `everybody loves'. `Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' is most illogical movie I've seen since `Lost in Space'.  `Lost in Space' at least had three shapely women in body-hugging space suits. PCCBP has Johnny Depp. Johnny has turned in some really good performances (`Edward Scissorhands,' `Ed Wood,' `Sleepy Hollow,' and, especially, `Don Juan DeMarco') but his loose, effete `Jack Sparrow' is more `Captain Morgan' than Captain Kidd. That is, the rum is doing most of the acting. WARNING: SPOILERS Well, let's see, all the crew of the Black Pearl except Jack Sparrow, BUT INCLUDING WILL'S FATHER, have been cursed for stealing Aztec gold. As part of their curse, food turns to ashes; and, while they cannot die, in the moonlight they are clearly rotting corpses. HELLO!  If they cannot die, HOW COULD THEY KILL WILL'S FATHER? If they are really rotten corpses, WHY DIDN'T THEY DIE AS SOON AS THE CURSE WAS LIFTED? I can understand why Will wasn't cursed, BUT WHY WASN'T ELIZABETH? Oh, because she did it to save Will, THEN WHY WAS JACK SPARROW CURSED? Oh, because he was Captain of the Black Pearl; DO YOU REALLY THINK A CURSE WOULD BE SO SELECTIVE? I can understand why the Black Pearl crew became rotting corpses when they were cursed. They spent a period of time suffering from starvation and thirst, but WHY DID JACK IMMEDIATELY BECOME A ROTTING CORPSE? Oh yes, I've heard, `Forget the logic and enjoy the fun.' How much fun is there in an adventure movie where the only mortals you care about are so central to the plot you KNOW they cannot be killed? I enjoyed the production values, the music and the performances, but I never forgot this is a BAD pirate movie. If you really want to have fun watching a good pirate movie, see `The Crimson Pirate' or `Swashbuckler.' If you insist on seeing a bad pirate movie, see `Cutthroat Island'. At least it makes sense.",

Jack Sparrow is a hero for the ages! brought to life by the lovely Johnny Depp. Depp gives a swashbuckling original performance. Curse of the Black Pearl is high seas adventure to the very end, barrels and barrels of fun! It's good and fun for every last second! Captain Jack's character introduction is excellent, at the very beginning when he first steps onto the docks from his sinking sail ship, I love that! It reveals Jack's sloppy and resourceful being as a pirate. Depp acts brilliantly and totally brings out the best in Sparrow. He acts like a drunkard. I can imagine how much fun this role would have been for Depp. The nomination was good but he should have brought home the Oscar. Orlando Bloom's attractive as young Will Turner. Depp and Bloom alone are plenty amusement for the ladies. Keira Knightley looks amazing as Elizabeth Swann as she's wonderful. She's just too good of an actress, better than even Rush or Depp. Geoffrey Rush is great as Barbossa, a creative and fun villain. The 1st Pirates of the Caribbean is the only one worth its weight in gold. The sequels pale in comparison. Each of the Pirates of the Caribbeans are worthy for Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack character if nothing else, but the 1st Pirates is the only one that's really well-crafted. Curse of the Black Pearl has great writing, gorgeous cinematography and sharp, learned dialogue. I love the visuals of this film! Pirates is funny and is one awesome family adventure! Pirates of the Caribbean is a great tale filled with interesting characters, pretty landscapes, and extravagant sets. It's really always a good viewing, it's harmless fun, and it never grows old!

It was his umpteenth time at Disneyland, my very first, (at age 43, yet!!!) For him, it was a revelation about seeing the Magic Kingdom through adult eyes vs. the awestruck vision of a young teenager. Even more so for me, since coming to the Magic Kingdom had been virtually all I dreamed about after seeing it so many times on ""The Wonderful World of Disney."" Needless to say, though I pretty much enjoyed myself there, a lot of the more kid-friendly attractions simply left me cold, or at the very most, lukewarm.

463,2 December 2005,russem31,7, Funny,"There is only one real reason I liked this film and can be summed up in two words - Johnny Depp. He really made the film what it is - a funny action adventure. In fact, although the the main focus seems to be around Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters (and their romance which was not very believable), Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack Sparrow was the real focus and what a riot he is! The visual effects was pretty good too. Other than that though, the story itself is okay (I thought Cutthroat Island had a better story and that's saying much) and the music was average (Hans Zimmer has done better - i.e. The Lion King). But still see this film because of Johnny Depp, actor extraordinaire!",

The film really had little to offer in terms of an original story, but if you are looking for a film that is fun and something to liven up a dull evening, this film is okay.

I know must of the lines by heart and I still thinks it's a brilliant movie even when I know the ending. Johnny Depp is a brilliant actor and even when he's not in focus he completely steals the picture.

I'm glad I did, since it's really fun, but not mind numbingly preposterous. Depp is stunning. Captain Jack just oozes charisma, and I eagerly awaited his return when he wasn't onscreen. I had no idea what this film was about, so the little twist was a complete shocker and quiet scary! I think Johnny Depp deserves the Oscar for his performance. Granted, the other guys gave powerful performances and what not. But Depp did too, and he took a lot of risks in his! None of the other nominees stole every scene of their respective movies. Also, their character portrayals were easily dictated by the script. But Depp created someone refreshing and new. The only thing I could say is that this movie is waaay too long. Three hours?

Yes, the plot requires actual concentration on the details, but that's part of the fun. The pacing is fast when it needs to be; the camera can linger, too. Depp is a wonderful pirate: cocky, self-assured, disarming, dangerous, single-minded. He flouts the rules and rulers with the aplomb one expects of an outlaw. He brings a particular zest to the role that he skews in interesting directions. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann (see Maureen O'Hara in The Black Swan) is one of the few fully-realized female characters in a genre film. Her bravery and longing for adventure are clearly shown as traits held even as a child. So it's no surprise to see her reject the proper suitor and insist on meeting the pirates personally. Orlando Bloom is pretty, but pale except in one smashing fight scene. Fun, fun movie with great outtakes on the DVD. Go see it; then rent Captain Blood, Against All Flags and the Black Swan.",

It even copies ideas like being stranded on an island and going crazy (like how herman toothrot was stranded on monkey island for so long and went mad). The idea of finding a ship and a crew. And it copies other things like not only it being set in the caribbean and having a voodoo lady, but the actual set and having to row through a swamp to get to the voodoo lady's shack, pirate towns made of broken ships and so many things just completely lifted from the game and lazily put into the film. The main villain of Pirates of the Caribbean also looks identical to the villain in Monkey Island.

Depp did his usual strong performance, but I wonder if he actually read the script before agreeing to do the movie.

Pirates attack a settlement known as Port Royal and capture the town's governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), as they believe that she is the one who can remove a curse set upon them. They lug her aboard the Black Pearl, their ominous sailing ship. In a prison in a battered garrison in Port Royal, William Turner (Orlando Bloom) makes arrangements to free Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), A captive, and some-what idiotic pirate, in exchange for his aid to rescue Miss Elizabeth Swann, the woman who William is madly in love with. Along the way, there are many sword fights, but as this movie is a pirate one, viewers will expect a major death. Sadly there are none. Most of the time it miraculously stops or those cursed pirates never die, because they're practically undead. Many of the fights are absolutely retarded and pointless, with no purpose what so ever, except just to allow this movie to be classified under a pirate theme.

This film was a grand scope of true adventure, to be at sea and fighting off cut throats at every corner of the ocean. Geoffry Rush was magnificent as the double crossing Captain Barbosa. And in the middle is William Turner (orlando Bloom) a man who is love with the lovely Miss Swan (Keira Knightly).

Jack is a maniac and gets everything by the way he twists things. The moonlight fight is very unique and interesting. Phasing in and out of the muscle and bones. Too smooth of the transition. The two pirate friends are interesting even on rewatch. Love is not something we can force upon. It will happen when you are most unaware of it. The plot is weaker for the middle. How inexperienced sailors truimph but sometimes luck favors the brave so I am giving them the benifit of doubt. Pirate code is a set of guidelines. Curse is much worse when you get to know what it is. It makes you realise not everything is in the riches of gold and money. But rather the small things we do everyday.,

513,18 July 2003,supertom-3,9," One of the years best, pure fun start to finish, Depp is on Fire!!","Adventure. Last year, I spent the summer watching TV shows about pirates, and now I decided to remember another favorite childhood series, the Pirates of the Caribbean, which will be discussed in the near future. Since I already have a review on ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"", it remains to talk about the first four parts. The picture of my childhood, which started the successful series of adventures of the tireless and extravagant pirate Jack Sparrow, forgive Captain Jack Sparrow, and again returned the word ""fashion"" to the pirates all over the world, and this is what your humble servant came across. I stared at this picture as a child, spitting from advertising, and now I am happy that I can turn on the player at any time, get a blu-ray disc, and watch this masterpiece of adventure cinema. Yes, I know, it sounds a little pathetic and completely subjective, but thunder me, it is! And here is my brief opinion - the intriguing beginning of the adventures of Captain Sparrow. I'll explain about the shortcomings of the first part, as they are and are very striking, but I will focus on the obvious advantages, which I turn to.
So here they are:
1. Atmosphere - the adventure spirit itself is in the air, filling us with marine romance of the distant past, when the leading colonial powers of Europe were afraid of sea robbers who robbed and committed other noble deeds, and the word ""pirate"" sounded with hatred and reverence at the same time. What can I say, in three parts with the atmosphere - a complete order. We are waiting for a swirling action movie in a pirate setting, with a share of mysticism, humor and filled with colorful heroes. This feeling is supported from the first to the last frame of this movie, which is quite small in timing (two hours twenty three minutes)
2. The first appearance of Jack Sparrow - that this scene became cult and spectacular at the same time, this is not a secret to anyone. She still causes nostalgic feelings among us, the children of the nineties, whose childhood fell at the beginning of the zero. And the new generation of viewers will like it. Johnny played here at the highest level, and do not argue with me about this. Yes, and the scene itself reflects the very mood of the first part, and later this technique was used. My respect to Johnny!
3. A captivating story - in addition to the main character Jack, we have here a romantic duet of William and Elizabeth, squabbles with old and new friends, an ancient curse and, of course, sword-fighting. The story itself is quite simple, but in childhood I did not care about that, and now, in principle. The turns are pretty predictable, the ending is too obvious, but you still watch this picture for the hundredth time, and enjoy it, like the very first! Is it possible about the dialogues that we all know by heart, I will not say anything? Can? Can? Thank!
4. Contractions - they are all set at the highest level. It's immediately obvious where a large part of the rather big budget went (one hundred forty million, not including advertising costs) - and it worked. Even eighteen years after the release, these moments look grandiose and the viewer receives genuine pleasure from them. The movements are polished, extras, although small, but know their business. Is it worth saying that the final fight is performed at a height and is remembered forever? Thanks again!
5. Humor - of course, the lion's share rests with Jack, but other heroes also contribute. You can laugh at these moments endlessly. There is not even vulgarity, which I am very glad to admit!
6. Music - the team of the famous composer Hans Zimmer, in particular his assistant Klaus Badelt, worked on it. They created the title topic, which we all know by heart, and even wake us up in the middle of the night, we will only give it a whistle. This theme is present in all parts of the series. But the rest of the music fits perfectly into the atmosphere.
Now about the shortcomings. There are some remarks in terms of the script and stupid moments, but against the background of the rest of the parts they simply fade, so I will not reduce the final grade. Just know that the picture is not perfect!
A little about the main characters:
1. Captain Jack Sparrow performed by Johnny Depp is a charismatic pirate whom you do not meet in the best possible way, but an impudent mind, courage, courage and resourcefulness will still make us open our mouth in surprise. In this part, he has one task - to find his ship and take revenge on a long-standing enemy. You can say anything about Johnny Depp, but in this series even you are forced to admit that he is damn good! Johnny is cool, and this is not discussed!
2. Captain Barbossa performed by Jeffrey Rush - Jack's long-standing enemy and captain of the Black Pearl, the most formidable pirate ship in the Caribbean. Devilishly charismatic, firm, even stubborn, moderately tolerant. Jeffrey was a great fit for this role, his confrontation with Jack is simply interesting to watch. They even complement each other. Jeffrey, my respect!
3. Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann performed by Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley - our couple in love, without which it is impossible to imagine any adventure. Orlando and Kira act out beautifully, between them one feels the very ""spark"", without which romance disappears without a trace.
Other heroes appeared in the picture that are worthy of a separate mention, but I will tell about this in the subsequent parts, where their characters will reveal even more.
It is amazing how from the attraction in Disneyland a whole series of adventure films could be born, which has become a landmark for so many people on our planet.
I especially want to note the Russian dubbing, which surpassed the original English track - it takes pride and happiness for the country (I know what I'm talking about, I looked in both languages)!
The fees for the first part were decent (almost seven hundred million), so we could talk about the continuation, and it started to happen .. We'll talk about sad things in my review of the fourth part, but for now imagine that it's the middle of zero, and we all look at this series in reliable and loving!
I will tell you about further adventures of your favorite heroes in a review for the second part under the heading ""Dead Man's Chest"".
As a result, we have a great start to the adventure series of childhood, with a great story, cool music, spectacular fights, charismatic heroes, great humor and great acting. Yo ho!",

This odd combination is one of the funniest screen personas ever created, adding a prideful element of egocentric status to this likable adventure. Orlando Bloom is noble as he chases the beautiful Keira Knightly, but it is Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa that adds the fairy tale element as the smart and commanding villain pirate, while the silly British army, always a step behind, adds a bit of comic belief.

Will Turner, a blacksmith trying to find his childhood friend, Elizabeth Swann, a hot heroine who certainly isn't a Damsall in Distress, and Captain Jack Sparrow, a wity, crazy pirate that can get out of any situation. There are many other characters too, but they would take too long too explain. My only problem with this film is the problem everyone seems to have with the third film, it's hard to follow. So I don't really care, I just watch the action, and effects. If you're one of the six people who haven't seen this movie, buy it on DVD, it's fun, entertaining, and is just plain great.",

526,29 December 2003,lilkid4eva,10, favorite!!!!,"This is another one of those highly over-popular films like the Lord of the rings trilogy. Of the main cast, the only two actors that I liked were Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp, but the rest, especially the over-pretty girl, all make me cringe. The people that made the film were obviously intending to make a swashbuckling classic, but instead they made a swashbuckling pile of cow diarrhoea. It is insulting in the memory of such real swashbuckling heroes of the cinema, such as Erroll Flynn. If this film had been made in the 1930s it would have been a million times better without a doubt, basically because it would be entirely different. I am going to get murdered by the entire world's population of women for saying this, but Orlando Bloom is nothing but another one of those really annoying pretty-boys, but, to be fair, that is just the opinion of an ugly teenager who has to go into school each week and watch all those bloody pretty-boys snogging whoever they want, while all the girls look at me and in disgust. But in my opinion, being ugly and being well aware of the fact isn't such a bad thing. It makes you wiser. But that has nothing to do with the film that I am reviewing so why the hell am I talking about it? Anyway this film is pointless and overlong and completely pathetic, and I am pretty sure that if pirates knew that this film was going to be made, they would have decided to become regular bank-robbers. 5/10 (I am giving it such a high score for Geoffrey Rush's sake. You rule Geoff.)",

530,22 April 2004,em_1986,10, The best film of 2003.....,"It would seem a given that an action/adventure film based on a theme ride at Disneyland would be an underwhelming disaster. However, one would be refreshingly incorrect on that score - at least as far as this film goes. An incredibly imaginative and rousing swashbuckler directed with technical finesse by Gore Verbinski and sporting a solid screenplay. The film would have been good fun on its own merits, but it has been gifted with a tremendous lead performance by Johnny Depp as the riotous Captain Jack Sparrow - a lucky pirate rogue who manages to succeed in spite of himself. The visual effects are dazzling and the film has a spirited supporting cast. Geoffrey Rush is an intimidating villain as the cursed Captain Barbossa. Keira Knightley is enchanting as the gutsy governor's daughter and secret pirate groupie accidentally caught up in the adventure. Orlando Bloom brings much of the grave beauty of a young Douglas Fairbanks to his role as the more traditional hero and provides the film much of its heart. Yet the real reason to be amazed is Depp's incredible work. Any actor can take a great role and be good in it, but only a great actor can take an iffy role and turn it into a scene-stealing delight the way that Depp does here. This is the mark of a great actor and he should have walked off with the Oscar were Oscar voters not so overly entranced with Sean Penn's tiresome Method acting from Mystic River. If the film has any weakness, it is that it sports at least one ending too many and the pacing starts to flag slightly before the credits roll, but these seem trivial compared to the achievements.",

532,6 December 2021,Christopher_Reid,7," A fun adventure, but silly and pretty shallow","Johnny Depp's withering pirate parody is probably the only reason to watch this swashbuckler update, but he's been better elsewhere and his performance is typical of the film's major problem, namely the slurred, mumbling accents that most of the cast has adopted. It makes for difficult viewing: the needlessly complicated plot is hampered by an inability to understand much of what is going on (although the basic outline is elemental to anyone who's ever seen a film of the genre); you have to strain to hear explanations for the more mystical aspects of the story. It's a very generic piece of work; the director, Gore Verbinski, doesn't seem to have the ability to create any real tension or action sequences that arouse much excitement and consistently allows the set pieces to be interrupted by long stretches of exposition (thanks to a wordy script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio that could have used a few decent jokes). Verbinski chooses to keep the focus on Depp and while Depp is always welcome whenever he's onscreen, he has trouble connecting with the rest of the cast, which, though it includes the incredibly hammy Geoffrey Rush, has nowhere near the acting bravura he has. The remainder of the cast includes Orlando Bloom (who fails to impress after `The Lord Of The Rings'), Jonathan Pryce and Keira Knightley.",

Johnny was really good as a pirate and he just looks the part for a pirate (Especially when he isn't in the movies). It was very funny and very good and brings pirates back into fashion. Keeps you busy and excited throughout the whole thing. It isn't right though that they'll make two other ones or sequels to it. I'll see them don't get me wrong but this end is just wow though. I enjoyed watching it. *Spoiler part* (Look away if you don't want me to ruin it) It is about a pirate who is not afraid of meeting people who disagree with him. He meets Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who is a blacksmith to save his girlfriend from another evil pirate who previously stole Johnny's ship. They set out to find her causing havoc everywhere. And in the end Johnny dies well not dead turns into a skeleton when fighting Barbossa and kills him. That's it really but if I didn't make it sound that good go see it anyway. End of review.

549,22 October 2005,cybermansec,8, Bril movie!,"I watched this movie with some friends at the cinemas a long time ago and I'm reviewing it now because ads on TV about the sequel jogged my memory. I can see now that Curse of the Black Pearl is very popular among IMDb members, especially among females and young people. If you are a young female you are much more likely to think you enjoyed this movie than if you are an old man. That's what the demographic breakup statistics say. I remember being very disappointed with this film and one reason why I was disappointed was because it was so long. I remembered getting up at the end of the film and because the film was so long my butt was aching as if someone had jabbed a needle in it. I am not averse to long movies but this one in particular was just not at all entertaining. The first reason for this lack of entertainment I think is the behavior of the characters. Johnny Depp's character is deliberately crazy. If one of my friends were to act like that in real life I would stare at him and after some time I would ask him, ""Man, what is wrong with you?"" In this movie, I am consistent with my behavior and badly wanted to ask Johnny Depp's character what was with the crazy behavior, but of course Depp is just acting and I obviously can't talk to the character through the theater screen, so that just left me feeling frustrated. Most of the movie is filled with humor that I didn't find funny at all, but many in the audience obviously thought it was very funny.

You know, critics don't like such kind of movies, the movies which they call blockbusters, they underestimate such kind of movies and don't give high ratings. Even the sequel can be an example. As I see, they did not like the second movie as many people did not. Firstly, I want to say that I don't categorize movies as blockbuster and non blockbuster. What I am trying to say is that Curse of the Black Pearl has nothing different or unusual that would make even critics appreciated, instead, it was engrossing, entertaining, but a so so movie. Just another adventure movie. I slightly enjoyed it, it was entertaining, but mildly entertaining, so I cannot say a lot of fun here. I had expected much more by trailer. I think that I can tell my thoughts more clear above The King Arthur. Curse of the Black Pearl is such a movie. I was entertained by The King Arthur, but just by some scenes, it was not uninteresting, it was engrossing, but no more than that. I had rented it, watched, was entertained, then gave it back. It was a so so movie, it was not a new Gladiator, it was not a new Excalibur. This first movie, Curse of the Black Pearl is such a movie, if you ask me. It is an engrossing pirate movie with ghosts who look like flesh and blood, but turn into ghost by moonlight. Cool! As for Johnny Depp, one of my all time favorite actors, Jack Sparrow is remarkable, interesting, but he cannot even touch Jack Sparrow in Dead Man's Chest. In the sequel, this character is much more interesting, eccentric, colorful and funny. However, his performance in all The Pirates of the Caribbean movies is outstanding, especially in the second movie! Jack Sparrow hides a secret, it is unfolded at the last part, but it ruins the character, it kills the humor of the character. I was just disappointed, but not so important. Before the sequel was released, I had been sure that the second movie would surpass the first movie by far on all counts and I was not mistaken about it.",

They battle together against the most treacherous pirates led by Captain Barbossa, in order to save the lovely Elizabeth, played by Keira Knightley, the love of Will's life.  They recover the lost treasure that Jack wants.  A clashing of swords between Will and Jack reminds me of milder sword fights in 30s films with Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone.

The ride first premiered at Disneyland in California in 1956. Since then, it has astounded riders with its stunning animatronics that make riders feel as if they are actually viewing real pirates. Now, in 2003, we are blessed with a film version, equally as remarkable as the ride, but far more frightening. Unlike the usual simple live-action films based on Disney creations, hence `The Lizzy McGuire Movie,' the new `Pirates of the Caribbean,' is a fine blend of swashbuckling action, stunning visual effects, elaborate sets and fairly good performances. Starring Johnny Depp (`From Hell'), Orlando Bloom (`Black Hawk Down'), Geoffrey Rush (`Frida'), Keira Knightley (`Bend It Like Beckham'), Jack Davenport (The Talented Mr. Ripley) and Johnathan Pryce (`What A Girl Wants'), `Pirates of the Caribbean' is quite possibly one of this summer's most exciting motion pictures. 	The story follows that of Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), who after being imprisoned is freed by a blacksmith named Will Turner (Bloom). Turner needs the help of Sparrow to hunt down a band of pirates who have kidnapped the radiant Elizabeth Swann (Knightley), who is the governor's daughter. Incidentally, Swann holds a medallion that has a secret power to transform her kidnappers back into real men, as a curse has left them as ghosts. It's now a race for Sparrow and Turner to find and kill the pirates before they sacrifice Swann in an ancient ritual to free themselves from the curse. ",

561,16 February 2004,Rocking DH,10, For those hard to hear lines....,"I did not rush out and see this film.  I mean, it is based on a theme ride at Disneyland/World.  Ah, but that was my mistake.  I kept hearing good things about it and finally did see it.  I immediately found the sound track and also purchased the 2-disc DVD set when it was released. Johnny Depp has produced a masterful characterization in CAPT. Jack Sparrow, borrowing perhaps a bit from the barge gypsy in ""Chocolat"".",
562,16 February 2004,Rocking DH,10, Reminded me of Saturday AM matinees.,"""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is one of the best adventure franchises of the recent years. It is a incredibly funny and exciting combination of adventure, action, fantasy and comedy, with excellent results.",
563,19 May 2011,acetylcholinenjoyer,10, Great adventure flick,My rating: *** out of ****. ,
564,6 September 2003,MF210,8," Good, solid fun","A true epic from start to finish. So many twists, turns, and betrayals to keep you on your toes. Without Depp the movie probably doesn't work, but alongside him the rest of the cast elevates their game. This movie genre always just teeter between being too silly and corny and too serious and a bore. The Curse of the Black Pearl finds that sweet spot. Nearly 20 years later since its release it still delivers the same flare as before.",
565,6 August 2022,ThereelscoopwithKK,9, A Pirates Movie for me,This movie was awful.,
566,1 September 2003,imdb-319,2, Waste of time,"An ""adaptation"" of a ride at Disneyland seemed like kind of a flimsy idea, so I'm not entirely surprised that this overblown entry in the 2003 summer movie season isn't all that good. ",
567,19 October 2003,Ronin47,4," Johnny Depp is great, movie is weak (**)","I grew up with these movies and watching it today as an adult I have the same feeling I did back then, which is enjoyment.",
568,3 August 2021,bradykitchen-33648,8, Great Movie lots of fun,"Average action adventure Disney yarn is watchable mainly due to good performances by Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and the lovely Keira Knightley.",
569,18 August 2003,rob-236,4, Average Disney adventure,"It's great to see a movie made by people who remember what it was like going to saturday morning pictures, where our parents would leave us at the door and in we went with a few hundred others to let rip, and boo, hiss and cheer.  Pirates brings all that back, with the writing, action, effects and great perfomances by all bar the still not good keira, she does try but does not quite make it. she was crap in beckham, and is not the great beauty she and some others think she is.  Anyway the film was great fun and as everyone has picked up on Johnny Depp shows how good he is as an actor and what a great sense of humour he has.  Keith Richards should be proud as he is now immortalised on celluloid.",
570,15 August 2003,grumpy-3,6, It's good to be a kid again,"I absolutely love this series. I think it's one of Disney's best series of films, and Johnny Depp' s best work. Also, who doesn't like Orlando Bloom? These two make this movie into a corked up bundle of fun. All the quirky sword fighting scenes and the dialog between these two in the film is something else. You gotta love it. ",
571,15 November 2016,tiskec,8, <3 Love For Pirates <3,"Disney never ceases to amaze me.  'Pirates' is a humorous yet well-portrayed movie.  Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner are a kickass team in this movie of truth, honor, love, and adventure for the entire family!  8.8 out of 10.",
572,10 July 2003,staisil2,9, Prepare to be blown away,"This is a great shallow movie. No pretensions, great action, great jokes, pretty good actors. Directed by the well-known Gore Verbinski (no? not well-known? C'est la vie) and starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and some woman I forget.",
573,21 August 2010,pontifikator,8, Great shallow movie,When I saw this fifteen years ago I thought it was good. Rewatching it I found it in continually engaging with exciting scene after another. In my first viewing I dndn't care for the Orlando Bloom character but his role seemed to fit better second time around. The only criticism I offer is that it seemed to go on and on - perhaps it was ioo long.,
574,22 February 2018,futuretype,9, Too Much of a Good Thing,"Summertime is the perfect season for escapism, and if you're looking for the perfect choice that fits it all, look no further than this movie! It's got everything you want in a pirate movie: action, adventure, humor, romance, and a first some scares. The four Rush, Bloom Knightly, and of course the show stealing Depp have a ball in their roles. The addition of the skeletons add a nice touch of fright yet the humor offsets the intensity of the action and the scares. I have seen the sequels, but none of them can compare to this one! So what are you waiting for? Grab your compasses and hats and set sail with Captain Jack Sparrow!",
575,27 June 2022,reddragonhero17,10, The ultimate summer swashbuckler!,"When the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was released, I was really looking forward to watching this movie. However, I finally managed to watch it many months later and I LOVED it!",
576,27 July 2004,marymmp2449,10, A great movie!!!,"Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush are two of the main reasons to see this film. Their note-perfect and seemingly effortless portrayals of rival pirate leaders Sparrow and Barbossa fills the screen whenever they appear. Other actors are allowed their chance to shine as well, thanks to Gore Verbinski's generous direction.",
577,26 November 2006,extravaluejotter,7, Ah-har!,"Aside from Kill Bill, probably the most fun I had this year. I saw it thrice in theaters and can't wait for the DVD. Damn, Johnny Depp, if I was like that... Woo! Great acting from Depp. Bloom was cool too.",
578,20 October 2003,CapitanMeh,10, Awesome awesome movie...,"""Pirates"" is a fun adventure film that breaks out of its ""based on a Disneyland ride"" chains and delivers a near-perfect summer family blockbuster.",
579,31 December 2003,jmartinsson,7, Delivers the goods,"This movie is by far my absolute favorite. The drama, fights, romance, humor... EVERYTHING fits perfectly within each other like a puzzle.",
