0,5 November 2013,Fella_shibby,10," 'My child always comes first in class', this syndrome has truly ruined everything.","The film brings to light what it is truly like to be dyslexic. Aamir Khan succeeded in creating the awareness about dyslexia thru this film.
Sometimes we really need to step into the shoes of kids and see the world thru their point of view.
The irony is that we all were kids, we all went thru the pressure of performing in sports n studies but yet we push our kids, especially in India n China.",/
1,9 October 2011,drpakmanrains,10, Best Depiction of Dyslexia Ever in a Fictional Film,"As I just became aware of this film a few weeks ago, and ordered a DVD and watched it today (10-9-11) this review is unlikely to be seen by many because the film is 4 years old and there are nearly 250 user reviews already. So rather than rehash the plot, I will first mention that I have been an Educational Therapist for over 45 years, and have worked extensively with dyslexic and ADD and ADHD children in my practice, so this film had intrinsic interest to me going in. But despite seeing many films on learning problems through the years, some very good, I have never seen any movie that can come close to this one both in emotional power and subject accuracy. When I saw that the film is 165 minutes long, I was expecting to watch it in two sittings, but I never once felt the need to take a break, and in the second half of the film, when the director Aamir Khan enters the story, I was riveted continuously, and embarrassingly shed more than a few tears. If you have any interest in education and the problems the outsiders face, this is a must-see. And if you just want to see an intelligent drama with no car chases, explosions, sex scenes, or ultra violence, then you will be glad you saw this wonderful film, which, by the way, while it is about children, is not really for children, unless they are over about 11 or 12, or have suffered the experience of failing due to undiagnosed or treated reading or similar learning difference. Don't let the Disney Studio name fool you, this does not feel like a typical Disney movie, but the film does point out that Walt Disney himself had school learning problems as a child. Another aspect of the film is something I always try to impart to my clients: There is life after school. And it is not necessary to be the best at everything to be successful. Just become the best you are able and try to find something you like doing that makes you happy.",r
2,20 August 2021,planktonrules,10, Among the best films I've ever seen...and the best Indian one...and that's saying A LOT!,"I love Indian films and have seen more than most Americans. However, considering the country makes more films than any other (about 800 a year), I really have only seen a small number of their films. But, I must say that ""Tarre Zameen Par"" (""Like Stars on Earth"") is the best Indian film I've seen...even slightly better than ""Kahaani"""" and ""Three Idiots"" (another Aamir Khan film). It truly is a wonderful film and is better than nearly anything coming out of Hollywood these days.",e
3,27 June 2017,ThomasDrufke,8, Every Child is Special,"I'm not always a fan of the Bollywood style of filmmaking: overrun with musical montages and exaggerated dialogue and acting.

With a story as powerful as this one, it doesn't matter where or how the story is told.",v

With some belting tunes to accompany the painting of a picture that seeks to raise awareness of the missed opportunities and damage an intense and blinkered culture of success can lead to, the finale is a joy to behold.",i

8,22 December 2007,danzs,9, Oxygen to Revive the Soul,A good film on children has always been much needed for Indian film-goers. And when in this moment of dearth one gets treated to a movie that simply touches the soul - needless to say - Taare Zameen Par - does just that.,r
9,23 December 2007,kaustubh-2,10, Undoubtedly the best Hindi movie of 2007,"If you haven't seen Taare Zameen Par, you are missing out. The best Hindi movie of 2007 without doubt. Extremely sensitively handled, and flawlessly executed performances, especially by Darsheel Safary. This movie really hits you.",w
10,25 December 2007,big_malique,10, This has rocked the core in me !,"I sat down in my local theatre with no expectations at all, and what I was in for, for the coming couple of hours, was just mind boggling. Taare Zameen Par might not win any awards, might not get the praise it so surely deserves, but don't let that fool you. For this movie is not just a story about Ishaan, but a masterpiece ! Ishaan is a 8 year old boy who suffers from dyslexia, no matter how hard he tries he just doesn't succeed in day to day activities. But what is mostly the case in our hard society is that people don't understand him and his shortcomings. Most of the times they paint him off as a lazy-no good-brat and this drives his father so far that he will have no more of this nonsense and sends young Ishaan off to boarding school, where he gets treatened even worse. But one day arrives Mr Ramshankar Nikumbh, a temporary art-teacher and the only person in the world that understands Ishaan's problem. Taare Zameen Par moves on as Mr Nikumbh tries to understand and help out Ishaan with his problem. This starts a journey far greater and more beautiful we could ever imagine.",4
11,18 July 2008,angelshalz,10, Carries a lot of emotional weight and room for connection...,"I was impressed with this movie. Even more than with the Kite Runner. Mainly because it is one of the most sensitive and realistic Hindi movies that I have ever seen in my life. The first thing my sister said when we were out of the theater was ""I want that kid's autograph."" Darsheel Safary did a brilliant job as the dyslexic but cute Ishaan. I recommend that ALL parents watch this movie WITH their kids. This movie shows the effects of parental pressure, social isolation, andinspiration, of course. Aamir Khan was very provoking as the caring art teacher, Nikumbh, that recognizes young Ishaan's mental withdrawal yet his amazing ability to paint and build. It is one thing to imagine such bizarre things, but to put it on paper or construct things in an appealing way is definitely a gift. I thought that no part of the movie was melodramatic or overly done which is a major concern in Indian movies. Instead, I thought that there was a lot of promise in this movie just like how there is a promise in every child that has the motivation and faith to achieve something. And the title translated as ""Little Stars on Earth"" describes all children that are looking for this promise although they may not have everything that most children have. Wowwhat an effect this movie had on me",6
12,26 December 2007,vaibhav_bhandeo,10," Taare Zameen Par: Rated ""PRG"" (Parents Required Guidance)","If all start living on their own terms, this world will be altogether a different place. Childhood is that juvenile period in life when the dreams have no boundaries and sky is the limit. It's only when the weight of someone else's dream comes on your shoulder; life turns full circle and you start as if there was no past. Resisting sticking with past raises questions to your capabilities as in this world there is only one way to get praised which is to perform the best in all the fields.",8
13,8 February 2008,springsunnywinter,10, Every child is special,"Anyone who has rated Tare Zameen Par lower than 8 out of 10 (especially those who have given it a 1 out of 10 rating) either has not seen the movie or has a heart of stone because this was an absolute beautiful and heart touching film about a relationship between a teacher and a student. I felt really sorry for the boy Eshaan and his main problem was that he has a learning disability and is always lost in his fantasy world. The film gave a terrific insight to his fantasy world by showing spinning objects around his head and by an animated sequence. The best scene was the first appearance of Aamir Khan. I have always liked Aamir Khan's films and I would put Tare Zameen Par number 2 on his top 5 best movies & number 1 would be Lagaan. The story was very uplifting, which shows that even the worst student can become the best. It was already on the IMDb top 250 when it came out and was on about 180 place but sadly not anymore and I'm disappointed. There is a huge list of crappy films that are on the top 250 but not a single Bollywood movie and this gem is original.",7

I am pretty much sure that this movie has done an excellent job for all those people who are creative but not good in academics. Many people think things differently but in India like country where competition begins at the age of 4 they are just a dumb in the society. ,4

17,21 December 2007,obscure_reality,9, A splendid effort..,First point: Taare Zameen Par is not a movie for children. Its also not a movie only about 'special' children. What it stands for and depicts stunningly is how the cruel world outside is stealing away our children's precious childhood. It is about how our parents are turning into monsters and imposing their own dreams and aspirations on their children which eventually destroys our children's confidence and can only create a generation of hate. Its about how each child needs attention and care and how we so lack those qualities in this life thats bounded by time.,/
18,26 December 2007,ssnadig,10, Simply Sensational,"An excellent direction, beautiful narration and an emotional ending. This movie deserves the best of applause. The director has done an out of the world job. At no point in the movie does he overshadow the kid. The best thing I love about the movie is the facial expressions of Kid. This kid is a genius and has filled life into the role of a dyslexic. Movie is so perfect, doting mom, lovable brother and a strict dad. The manifestation of problems has been toned beautifully and the way the kid is helped to get out the problems is artistic. I hope I could vote more than 10 for this masterpiece. Missing this movie would be a blunder.",?

20,27 March 2014,lucas_carvalhaes,10, I'm crying. This is a master piece.,"Here is the deal this time. If you are sensible, you are gonna get crushed. This movie is deep in so many aspects of our society, and at the same time deals with everything in such a cute and delicate way, that one cannot watch this and feel nothing. The movie talks about a boy that has dyslexia and is miss interpreted by everything he cares about. It is touching at the same time it is critic. The entire history is permeated with subtle irony and heavy criticism about the contemporary way of doing things and solving problems. Talks about the objectification of persons in order the achieve our own personal goals... well, there is so much to this movie that I believe I just got lost here. Lets get to the point, this movie is just beautiful. Completely amazing. Who should watch? Everyone. I'm not going to talk about moods in this one since it is so important because of its contents... Just watch it.",e
21,22 December 2007,bobbysing,10, In simple words  THAT'S CINEMA IN ITS PUREST FORM,"Taare Zameen Par  Words fell short as I start writing about this impressive emotional movie from ""Aamir Khan"" & his team. Unarguably the film deserves a standing ovation for its unusual content and for its near perfect execution. The impact I felt after viewing it was quite similar to what I felt after watching movies of great film makers like Bimol Roy and Guru Dutt. Aamir Khan delivers what was expected from him, an out of the routine, emotional, memorable and enlightening film which is capable of bringing changes in the lives of many families. The film revolves around a boy who is facing difficulties in studies and his teacher who comes in his life as a morning breeze. The film emphasizes completely on the character of the child, his thoughts and it's a journey into the imaginative world of his mind. The visual interpretation of what he is thinking is innovatively shot and is a visual treat to watch . Aamir Khan is a thinking brain with a heart of gold and that he has proved with his directorial venture. He has the guts of following his heart and coming out with an unconventional film like this. Another merit of the film is that it is not preachy, it teaches along with providing the required entertainment to the viewers. The film talks about a condition of a child who is finding tough to compete with his classmates but it never talks about it as a disease or a mental disorder to cure. Aamir focuses on the fact that we got to give proper attention to all kids as everyone has his own areas of abilities. He also pin points on to the parents who always want their children to score in their studies and just ignore the other aspects of life relating to art and culture. Darsheel Safary, the eight year old child has given a stunning performance. He is not acting, he is emoting his character and has done his part so well that he even overshadows the subtle and cool performance of Aamir. Another actor to watch out is Tisca Chopra as the mother of the child. She is just perfect and makes you remember the motherly touch in your childhood days. The scenes of Aamir with the father of the child are the most effective in the movie. The lyrics of Prasoon Joshi are above than the music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy. They both are more impressive while watching the movie. In short, it's the movie which should be watched as a compulsion by all parents along with their children (would be parents too) and also by all the teachers who should feel the responsibility they have towards each & every child they teach. Concluding my review I would like to request my Indian film lovers that this is a movie which is meant to be watched without munching the popcorn and rightfully deserves a respectful viewing. Hats off to Aamir Khan & Thanks for giving us ""Taare Zameen Par"". The movie is simply above the star rating system",f
22,21 December 2007,lovermire,10, A must watch for every parent.....!,"""Taare Zameen Par"" is an exceptional story, but it is only and exceptional film because of its director (Aamir). Aamir does an amazing job of engaging his audience, introducing a brilliant main character (Ishan), and making the audience experience the reality of children's paradise & their inner world. The story to which very people could relate; however, the directorial & cinematography mastery exhibits throughout allows the audience to accompany Ishan on his journey and awareness of his weakness. Anyone who has been close to the frailties of the human mind will appreciate how respectfully and honestly this film approaches the subject. Aamir is able to portray all the complex reactions to mental dimension's while maintaining the humanity and essence of the subject. Superbly directed, wonderfully acted by Tanay Chheda (ishaan) and cast, this film succeeds on every level.",_

25,21 December 2007,SinglePlex,10, A children's film that would make Robin Williams proud!,"Being Aamir's directorial debut, one was sure of a didactic film. Somehow, Aamir never sets out to just tell a story or make a movie; the social message is never far away. He would almost be a Shyam Benegal if not for the dollops of humor he manages to sprinkle in his movies. The archaic belief that humor stains the ""purity"" of a serious message is the biggest mistake made, I feel, by ""art movie"" makers. A brilliant work like ""Khoya Khoya Chand (2007)"" was ruined by its droning pace and monotonic atmosphere. You look forward to Aamir's cinema because he uses humor, songs-- even pretty heroines-- to make sure his serious cinema is taken seriously!",t

This is a class act, a marvelous concept and direction to perfection makes this flick different from others, which is always the quality of an 'A' movie. It is the movie of a lifetime; sincerely I would say this is one of the best Hindi movies I have ever seen. It is not a roller coaster of emotions or just another emotional drama; this is the story of a child who was just left alone with his misery. Aamir comes to his help and becomes his only hope. Aamir is not the hero he comes in the second half, actually Darsheel Safari can be described in one word as ""Outstanding"".",
33,14 January 2008,shortyrags,7, An Absolute Delight!,"Aamir Khan's debut directorial performance is an astounding feat. Its product is one of the best films of 2007. And I'm not just talking about Bollywood. Taare Zameen Par is a different type of film that does not conform to the typical norms of the masala industry. It is a breath of fresh air that does just enough on the predictable side to reel in typical Hindi film audiences. However, at no point does Taare Zameen Par conform to the standards of melodrama or impossibility and fantasy. ",

35,2 March 2016,Quinoa1984,6, has its heart squarely in the right place and some very good dramatic scenes... until it doesn't,"First off, Aamir Khan deserves credit for trying to shed light on what I'm sure is a problem in India. As it was when I saw 3 Idiots and had to take the movie's word for it about the problems with suicides, I had to also take it that in this case, Like Stars on Earth, there's no real perception from teachers about dyslexia and other cognitive disorders (the young boy in this story, Ishaan, played by Safary, is this kid, and I have to wonder if he also had un-diagnosed ADD and/or aspergers, the latter being more about social awkwardness which Ishaan also is). In the United States its something that gets tackled when kids are very young in schools - and, of course, even in the lamest public schools there's a guidance counselor of some sort, which seems to be a deficiency in the schools depicted here - so I can understand why it would be something to shine a light on. And, as a first time director, Khan is very good at drawing out (mostly) strong performances from his actors, even if they only have a few minutes of screen time.",

Best part about this movie is that somewhere in your life, you have faced each and every character of this movie. You can relate yourself to a child who has gone through sweet and bitter time of school age. Or you can relate yourself to parents who is trying their best to keep their children to get prepared for competitive world. This movie can remind you of all strict, result oriented school teachers whose punishments you can never forget. Personally i liked two best scenes in the movie: 1. When aamir khan finds out about the troubled boy at his parents home and trying to convince them to help this child. 2. When Aamir tells the story of Solemon island where people curse the trees to let them die. i recommend each and every individual to watch this movie at least once in their lifetime.",

44,30 December 2007,aniket-ketkar,10, Wow!!!!,"Bollywood has always been deprived of such movies. Aamir Khan, a talented actor, ventures into directing a movie, a movie which is a bit different, and does it brilliantly. The movie starts with story of 8 year old, naughty kid, Ishan. Ishan has played a role of a boy who is very poor at studies. But his thought process is a bit different than others and his mind, very creative!! His parents are really worried about his future. Due to regular complaints about him from School, building etc his dad decides to send him to a boarding school. And this is where the movie takes a real turn. The story then takes us to the problems faced by the boy, his mental stress and then very emotional relationship between him and his arts teacher (Aamir). The flow of movie is just awesome. It is full of emotions. Though the movie is about a kid, it is meant to be watched by parents along with their children. I think this movie certainly deserves a spot in IMDb top 250. Also after so many years, a Bollywood movie has given hope for an Oscar.",

They all punish him for the mistakes that he makes and one day, this leads to him missing his school as well as Maths test. Later, on returning home, he informs his elder brother about it and asks him to write a sick note to the teacher.

His venture as Producer, in Lagaan  did fetch him accolades worldwide, including the Oscar nomination. So would this next product also be so special? The story is about a 8 year old boy Ishaan (Darsheel Safary) who finds it difficult to concentrate on his studies and finds innocent pleasures in the worldly things around him. This attitude of Ishaan makes him a centre of laugh and taunt that leads to his cranky and odd behavior. His parents decide to send Ishaan to boarding school to improve his studies.

What do we really offer them, right now ? A life full of discipline and homework, an unyielding drive for progress, bound to timings, curriculum and the ever pervasive rat race ? Even when we do extra-curricular activities, we make it as bad as work - are we on time, are there special classes, how good are they, will they be successful ? When do we really let them just be kids, with their own special time ? Can't we just let them enjoy childhood, before they enter this big bad world of grown-ups and of adult rules ?",

It's not the commonly masala type movie which we are used to seeing featuring the likes of Sharukh Khan or Akshay Kumar. Nor are they overtly stereotyped like movies of Kay Kay Menon or Manoj Bajpai.

The craze for this movie was evident when i saw people rushing to have tickets at the box office.. I also got the ticket after a great fuss. Enthusiasm of elders was very much noticed..

56,22 January 2008,HeadleyLamarr,7, This child is SPECIAL!,"This directorial debut by the ""perfectionist"" Aamir Khan carries the tag-line ""Every Child is Special"". Ishaan Avasthi, an 8 year-old, is a dreamer and dreams best in class. He is repeating 3rd grade and under-performing by a lot. He has a superstar sibling who aces all his tests and badminton. Ishaan is ridiculed by his teachers and classmates, berated by his ambitious father and pushed along by his harried mother. One day he bunks school and is packed off to an expensive boarding school, but things are no better for him there. He has but one friend, and the teachers continue to be tartars and caricatures - until a colorful sensitive substitute art teacher, Mr. Nikumbh, arrives and sees that Ishaan is locked up in his inward looking universe. Nikumbh is dyslexic and immediately knows that Ishaan too is suffering from dyslexia. He champions Ishaan's cause most vociferously  this includes telling the class that dyslexics can be geniuses  like Einstein, DaVinci, Abhishek Bachchan (???). Ishaan builds a most DaVinci like transport vehicle model out of twigs and knick-knacks he collects, begins to learn letters from Mr. Nikumbh, and eventually to READ. Then there is an art competition in which we see how fun filled and normal the teachers and kids really are, we see Ishaan winning and becoming the hero of the school and his parents. The movie ends with Ishaan running back in slow motion towards Nikumbh!! To call this well-intentioned fare bland would be unkind, after all it deals with learning disabilities and the message that parents need to love their kids no matter what, and kids need love to develop a sense of self worth. The film delivers the message in a fairly decent way that is several notches above public service messages. What is most likable is the protagonist Ishaan, played very well by Darsheel Safary. His buck toothed smile is used most effectively (not unlike the use of Michelle's wide eyes and duck walk in Black). Aamir plays Nikumbh in a preachy way that ranges from weeping at the drop of a hat to thunderous speeches delivered to the parents. Tisca Chopra is good as the harried and browbeaten mother. The father and all the other people associated with the educational system are caricatured to the maximum - they do help generate a lot of sympathy for Ishaan, but also some for the teaching profession that has been uniformly vilified here. The message gets muddled by Ishaan's winning the art competition  was it not that every child is special whether he has something special in him or not? Special schools are not spared either and branded as schools for retarded children. Again this is a less than desirable message about such schools that can focus expert teachers around kids that need them.",

59,20 September 2021,briancham1994,9, Touching and genuine,"The stand out feature of this film is just how genuinely it portrays the world of a child's life. The main character is portrayed wonderfully by the precocious young actor, showing a range of emotions and bubbly energy that permeates a child's life. His oppressive environment is also shown in a relatable way, as the harsh teachers, laughing students and ""perfect"" brother seem to develop their reactions naturally and not through contrived exaggerations like in Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995). The art teacher follows the same progression as he is a realistically cheery fellow who we really believe could lift this boy out of his funk. This sort of character runs the risk of seeming like a perfect saint who exists just to be perfect and solve everyone's problems, but Aamir Khan portrays him as simply someone with concerns who can bring out the best in people. All the little imaginative moments showing Ishaan's perspective were a joy to watch. The runtime and musical sequences needed heavy trimming, but other than that, this is one of the best children's films I've seen.",

I will however try not to ramble on too much about my personal experiences. I identified with everything Ishaan went through right down to the fact that he was misunderstood by his family who think of him as lazy. One of my favourite moments from Taare Zameen Par is the part when Aamir Khan goes to Ishaan's parents and Aamir khan forces Ishaan's dad to read Chinese writing on the box of a toy, that was truly a wonderful scene. Taare Zameen Par made an excellent point on what Dyslexic children lack in some areas they make up for in others. Ishaan may have been bad at English but his talents lied in Painting.",

93,30 March 2009,sumanbarthakursmailbox,6, A must for every parent.,"Taare Zameen Par is a good emotional story with a message for the parents. The kids and parents will completely enjoy it.The story is unusual but not unknown. The message that the story tries to convey is already known to us, but most of us just remain ignorant to it. Aamir Khan, the director, has handled the delicate theme with dexterity and precision. He has not just succeeded in making every child a hero but actually helped us see a child in ourselves. Just like no man is perfect no matter what position he commands in the society, every child with both their ability and inabilities is special and talented in their own way. The movie isn't just about a child suffering from dyslexia and his challenges, it's also about how parents get carried away by today's competitive world and fail to understand their child's dreams and nurture their inborn talents.Unlike any other enlightening entertainer which focuses more on the hero, Aamir has given the child more footage and captured every emotion deftly thereby focusing on its root cause and maintaining its significance throughout the movie. A number of sequences leave you moist eyed and you feel deeply attached to the child. At the end of the movie you are left speechless and spellbound. Music by Shanker – Ehsaan - Loy is great and lyrics by Prasoon Joshi are brilliant, they blend well with the movie. However the movie is not without its share of flaws. The editing could have been tighter; it tends to drag a bit while being repetitive at times.Darsheel Safary, the kiddo, delivers a knockout performance. His expressions, body language, eyes, dialogue delivery – absolutely perfect. The best lead performance of the year, deserves the best actor award. Aamir Khan as usual is excellent in a supporting role. Aamir fans could be disappointed to see him missing in the first half. Tisca Chopra is good. Vipin Sharma overacts a bit.If you believe in meaningful realistic cinema then do please do watch Taare Zameen Par.",

101,29 December 2007,shivanand2989,10, Taare Zameen Par broadens your outlook towards everything!!,"It's not everyday that a movie takes you with itself on a journey and lives you in a state of mind, where you don't know whether to appreciate the simple narration that touched your heart or to get thinking on the questions raised in your mind. Come to express what you felt, no words can do any justice to the experience called ""Taare Zameen Par"". No doubt it was a untold story with great potential. But, we always have great untold stories around us, which are waiting to see the daylight or should I say screen light. What we don't have is people who can venture into these projects and make sure that they build a strong bridge or should I say screenplay, that connects the story and the audience. Thanks to prior attempted bridges devastated by box office cinematic conditions. Aamir not only decided to swim against the tide with this story , but also did a great job as a first time director. Aamir's presence did made sure that audience makes it to the movie hall. But, from that point on it's Amole Gupte's screenplay and Darsheel Safary's performance that holds the movie together. Darsheel Safary plays the central character of the movie ""Ishaan"", who is a 8 year old boy, who lacks complete interest in studies. The movie starts with the outside world of Ishaan, where no one seems to understand his problem and eventually takes the audience into Ishaan's inside world. Once you are into his world, your ears can hear the silence on his lips and eyes can feel the pain in his tears. But you're not sure how to help him. Yes, I said ""help him"" because now Ishaan's journey is no more on screen. You are into the journey along with him and that's why you start thinking for him , instead waiting to see what unfolds on screen. The screenplay holds you so tight that you are only and only with Ishaan. Even when the songs come , they flow so smoothly in and out of the movie that you don't bother to tap your foot or think if the music is good or if this song was required. Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy have added lot of feathers to their musical cap, but ""Taare Zameen Par"" is a precious stone added to their cap. That's how beautiful their work is. Prasoon Joshi's lyrics feel like they are embedded into the script of the movie. They don't stand out as songs. Prasoon has proved his way with words before, but this movie demanded more than writing caliber and he does come out with flying colors. Setu's cinematography perfectly balanced the inner and outer world of Ishaan. The camera work did complete justice to the screenplay, by making sure we see the movie thru Ishaan's eyes. The great film captured on lens got perfect scissors on editing table. Deepa Bhatia's editing was so smooth that you just don't feel the presence of her scissors throughout the narration and that tells me she knows her job too well. Coming to background score, sometimes they are so overwhelming that take over the scene and sometimes they take backseat and softly add to the feel good or feel sad mood of the scene. But here, I seriously don't remember getting any feel for the presence of background score. It was neither in the background nor foreground, it was part of the scene and that too me was quite amazing. Coming to the performances, as I said before Darsheel Safary is a great find and Aamir as always is Aamir. One actor who really surprised me was ""Tisca Chopra"" , extremely delighted with her portrayal of Ishaan's mom. I think, more than kids this movie is a must see for parents. Back in India, even before the child enjoys the childhood , he is thrown into the competitive world and expected to excel only in academics. Hopefully this movie will bring in some change in the way we look at kids who don't come out with flying colors in their exams. Finally, Aamir's bridge connecting Ishaan and audience totally ROCKS..! and I hope we will walk on more bridges like this one.",

Eagerly waiting for Ghajini remake....",

107,8 May 2008,rafidhoda,8," Aamir Khan delivers yet a satisfying film, which exceeds every expectation you will have","Taare Zameen Par, which spells ""Stars on Earth"" in English is probably one of the most anticipated films of the year 2007 by Bollywood. It came out in December last year, and it got received with a blast, and director Aamir Khan was extremely happy with the final outcome. One of the factors which distinguishes TZP from other Indian movies, is that it is not based on the regular cliché of two individuals falling in love, but rather puts a real subject in the limelight. The story follows the nine-year-old protagonist called ""Ishaan""(Darsheel Safary). Ishaan is a brisky young boy, with a wild imagination. He loves to admire nature, and enjoys painting with bright freshening colors. The one thing he hates the most is to sit down and do his homework. He never manages to write a word correctly and letters seem to dance in front of his eyes, whenever he attempts to read a sentence. This rare condition sets a barrier between Ishaan and education, and leads to frustration. Ishaan eventually tries to ignore his homework and school because of countless episodes of outbursts from teachers and his parents. His exam papers are a pity for the human eye and Ishaan's teachers say that there is no hope for him. Ishaan's father takes this personally and decides to send Ishaan to a boarding school.",
108,29 November 2019,Vartiainen,7, Sledgehammer of emotions,"Ishaan Awasthi (Darsheel Safary) is a troubled child. His older brother is the jewel of the family, an honour student and destined for a great career. Whereas he struggles with simple math and reading, always getting yelled at for not paying attention and not doing better in school. So much so that his family makes the tough decision to send him to a boarding school, hoping that there he can learn some discipline. But then a substitute art teacher (Aamir Khan) starts to wonder that perhaps Ishaan's problems might not be due to his poor attitude.",
109,22 December 2007,sukrity,10, Making of a LEGEND - Aamir Khan,I am still overwhelmed after the show has long ended. It's has been an enriching roller coaster ride back to my childhood days. The emotions of the child artiste in the movie has left a big impression in me.He is truly amazing to say the least (the real hero of the movie).,
110,16 April 2008,pico_shaolin,10, Wonderful!!! Simply outstanding!!!,"From the very beginning I've been an Aamir Khan fan. His acting skills are beyond comparison. And now his he has also established himself as a fine director. Taare Zameen Par is not only an emotional and heart-warming movie, but also is very sensible, unlike most bollywood mind-bogglers. The real show stealer, however, was Darsheel Safary. I gotta admit, Aamir Khan was indeed lucky to get a fine kid like him. He's the one who holds the movie together. He put spirit in Ishaan's character. The plot is very unique as compared to most bollywood films. However, in actuality, dyslexia is very common among children, and this movie has been instrumental in spreading awareness about dyslexia and various other disabilities. Everything in this movie has been put together so well. The reactions schools, teachers and parents have towards children who are *unconventional* or more commonly described as *different* has been portrayed with exceptional skill. Bottomline: Masterpiece of a film, wonderful acting, great music. Definitely a must watch for kids and especially parents and teachers.",

Movie is based on a child suffering from dyslexia(disease in which people cannot figure out difference in different letters and more...WATCH TZP for details).Darsheel(Ishaan) the protagonist of the movie suffers from the same disease but no one near him ,parents ,teachers etc realize his problem and just consider him as a spoil brat ,unwilling to study and always making excuses.First half of the movie builds on this ignorance of people and different creative world of Ishaan.Ishaan being surrounded with his world of colors and imaginations(beautiful world) creates problems far mare than his parents can handle, so he is sent to a boarding school(NEW ERA PUBLIC SCHOOL).the internal chaos of Ishaan does not get any opening to escape out here and he gets silent(dull).BUT,here comes Nikumbh(Aamir khan)and whole dull world is transformed to vibrant colors.the fight and passion is for you to see in the movie.EVERY CHILD IS WIN ....WIN..BELIEVE THEM.",

113,8 January 2011,frankliemydear,10, This movie is really great!,"You've probably read the synopsis by now. This is a serious movie that deals with a depressed boy who has had his esteem destroyed by people who don't really take an interest in him. I think the director (and a lead character) did just a marvelous job with this movie. At times you don't know if the boy is going to live or not, he is so depressed. I was in suspense wondering what would happen. Darsheel Safary, who is ten or eleven, in this movie delivers an Oscar worthy performance. The movie also examines (what I think) may be an attitude in Indian life that classical success is the most important thing in life. There are lots of subplots. It's a complicated movie and they did a great job.",

116,22 December 2007,petera-8,8," A good start for Aamir Khan, the director","I saw Taare Zameen Par last night and I walked out of the theatre feeling that we're finally maturing as a movie making and watching country. For too long Bollywood has been associated with the typical ""masala"" movie. Its heartening to see that in the past 5 years or so, film makers have taken to making films about real issues without killing the fun of the entire celluloid experience. TZP would have probably been categorised as a ""art"" film about 6-8 years ago. ",

This movie is not only for the children but for everyone and I would also like to say that this movie is as good or maybe better than Black. This kind of movies is what Bollywood needs in order to prosper and stand out. All the big movies that came out this year with all the big stars and hot shots were pure garbage and shouldn't even been compared with this one. Om Shanti Om, Saawariya, Aja Nachle and many other weren't even half as good as this one.

125,28 November 2020,Kdosda_Hegen,9, Forced tearjerker.,"I don't find it realistic at all. In this film a kid has problems, but all teachers and parets think that the kid is just lazy. If anyone came to a school they know that no matter how angry or miserable or lazy the teacher is, he will still easily spot that the kid has some kind of problems and is not lazy. I call the plot of this film unrealistic. Also even when parents are told and proven that the kid has problems, they still don't believe and claim he's just a lazy troublemaker. I don't know maybe it's different in India, but in my country parents are not embarresed by their special ID children. On the other hand the Amir Khan's portrayed teacher is very inspirational character, we had a couple of similar teachers like him in my school. Anyway while it's a very heartwarming movie, it felt forced and cheap.",
126,28 December 2007,hi_namrata,10, a master piece!!!,"""Taare Zammen Par"" is not just a movie, its a emotional journey into the life of an ordinary Indian child. This truly depicts the life of an average Indian household, its very true that a lot of stress is being paid on being on the top, ranking first in studies. Parents don't want to admit that their child needs help just because they don't want others(family, friends, neighbors...) to say anything. They feel as if such thing reflects on themselves: ""How can my son/daughter be so and so"". They ignore the needs of the child to maintain their false ego in front of others. This movie takes the viewer into a life an average person can relate to, nothing fantasy. Its a must see for the parents who believe their child is infallible. A wonderful movie!",

Yet, despite a magnificent lead performance from a very talented young actor, Taare Zameen Par shares many flaws so common to Bollywood movies. Most of all, it is just ridiculously corny- the wholesomeness being shoved so far down your throat that you begin to gag. And it is also just far too long, especially when there is an inordinate amount of unnecessary filler. Aamir Khan's omnipotent hero seems to have an unhealthy interest in stroking young children and his obsession with Ishaan eventually borders on grooming.

The cacophony that surrounds a crowd exiting a theater will be missing. Some would be walking in slow motion. Some would look petrified. At least that's what happened in the theater I went to. Not a single soul was talking after the movie, probably because what everyone saw on screen was not fiction, but a semi-biography of his/her own life. In fact, the normally rowdiest gang in a theater (ie my friends and I) that is good vocal at the end of a film left the theater in pin drop silence. The first thing we said to each other - 'Aamir Bhai has done it again.' Aamir (and Amol Gupte) has made a pure film, without giving into the temptation of masala or 'what would the audience like to see' philosophy; for giving chance to fantastic yet unknown actors like Vipin Sharma and Tisca Chopra (I love Tisca); for riding against the tide; for not trying to hog the limelight in the film by happily playing second fiddle to the boy (even Aamir Khan's name comes after Darsheel Sarfi, the boy, in the credits); for giving the audience something different once again as an entertainer; and for truly caring about the society and using the medium to bring a change.",

The child does not believe that he is able to succeed. Thanks to his art teacher, he realizes that he is so much successful. And, he wins the contest of painting. Finally, his special talent is discovered. The film tells us every child has a special talent. Generally, parents criticize their children, they do not try to discover their different talents. We infer that we should not evaluate children as unnecessary person. We should not forget that every child have a talent which is big or small. This drama film affects people about this matter. Maybe, it can be a warning for people who behave in this manner.I am sure, while you are watching it, you will evaluate yourself in this matter. If you watch it, you may realize to behave so.

It suffers from several very clear tropes I've noticed in all the Bollywood films I've seen; cliche editing, awkward pacing, and most obnoxious the abundance of musical montage sequences which tend to get grating and interrupt the flow throughout. However, where this film really shines is in the characters and the plot which, while not phenomenal, are intriguing enough to hold my attention through its nearly three hour run time. Whilst a long run time in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing, it does make it more difficult to grip the audience, though I don't feel it a major issue in this film. Sure, there could have easily been an hour trimmed out of this film whilst keeping the important bits intact, but I feel it could have done more to earn a three hour run time as well.",

152,3 January 2008,jonathanvarunbenjamin,10, Movie of the Year 2007,"This movie is in the league of RANG DE BASANTI and the likes.. Aamir Khan has done it again.. TZP has a good message and has been pieced together wonderfully. The first half of the movie leaves you laughing at the extremely funny Ishaan; while making sure you break out into tears quite often seeing his plight. The second half (that's when Aamir Khan enters the scene) is even better; Overall; I'd say it has to be one of the BEST Hindi MOVIES EVER; certainly one of the best I've seen.. I rate it a 10/10 for a Bollywood Movie. Cudos, Aamir !! Oh yes, I almost forgot - how can one write a review on a Hindi movie without including some comments on the music. All songs featured in TZP have been chosen really well and fit the situation very aptly. The OST is worth a buy !",
153,24 December 2007,bhvenkat-26,10, Movie of a lifetime,"I cant think of any other movie in the recent past which has evoked such a response without any glamor quotient attached to it.The movie is so natural and real that you tend to look at the characters on screen and match them with the real life characters you come across everyday in your life.The child actor Darsheel is a revelation.He has come up with one of the best performances by any actor in a long time.The last performances that bowled me over were Shreyas and Naseeruddin Shah(in Iqbal).But this kid,Darsheel,has beaten them by a distance i guess.For a 9 year old kid to come up with such subtle and amazing expressions was nothing sort of unbelievable.He is the star of the movie. Credit must go to Aamir who lets the boy take all the credit.He,in spite of being a superstar,seems happy to let the boy dominate the movie.Kudos to him...!!!! This is one movie no one can afford to miss.You are sure to cry at the end-not because of drama,but because of the overwhelming feeling and joy.A must watch for everyone immaterial of country,caste and age..!!!Don't miss it!!",

It's a good film, don't get me wrong, but it isn't great. It engages with sensitive issues and is very touching. I loved the visual style of the film-I thought it was really creative and perfectly portrayed the mindset of the dyslexic protagonist Ishaan. But I didn't like all of the song numbers. I found them cheesy and unengaging. They hurt the viewing experience of the film for me, which is a shame, as otherwise I really did enjoy Stars on Earth.",

157,9 January 2008,clap_matrix,9, Taare unlimited!,"As a critic I find it extremely difficult to write about movies which touch me, cause it is impossible to be detached. You tend to forget the follies and focus on how you loved the movie rather than providing a critique.In the same vein reviewing TZP is not easy, the topic is sensitive, the script quite powerful and the performances quite flawless. But after watching the movie I feel compelled to write about it. TZP is essentially about an 8 year old dreamer who is branded a looser by the big bad world obsessed with results. The story focuses on his plight and how hope in form of a teacher resurrects the kid. Essentially a very simple story, where Mr. Khan excels is the way he has treated the subject, the way everything looks so natural that we begin to laugh and cry with the characters.To lend such credibility to a story is indeed a herculean task. It helps that the songs are spot on and are almost poetic flowing seamlessly through the narrative. Performance wise Aamir Khan as Ram Shankar Nikhumb acts with full honesty and becomes the character with effortless ease. The scene where he looks moist eyed at the disabled is worth his weight in gold. The angst and the helplessness he shows through his eyes makes one feel claustrophobic and bound. Every time you feel SRK is improving Aamir Khan reinvents himself. With Shahrukh Khan you see Shahrukh Khan, with Aamir you see DJ, Ram Shankar Nikhumb or the numerous character he portrays.The show stealer is of course Darsheel Safary as Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi. With Ishaan, he does a remarkable job in performing a very complex character so effortlessly, that one can't help but marvel. He speaks through his actions, he speaks through his eyes, he is always conveying something. Pain, anger, disgust. His ability to show twisted emotion of feeling the pain yet not wanting sympathy is something very rare to see in someone so raw. His presence is so overwhelming that other characters just serve as fillers. One can just hope that he doesn't randomly pick up movies. Darsheel has immortalized himself as Ishan Nandkishore Awasthi with this one performance.It will be a benchmark performance for years to come. Other characters are well etched and perform ably. The scripts has a few clichés like the painting competition and the final predictable victory but they don't put you off. You are addicted. You don't notice. You are blinded. Even after the movie ended I saw nobody moving, everyone was watching the end credits rolling silently. Almost everyone wiped a tear or two and silently walked out. They must have promised themselves to be a better person,better parents,to be more understanding, to be more human! Do yourself a favour watch Taare Zameen Par. Not tomorrow, but today, not later but NOW! Highly recommended!",

I was waiting for Aamir Khan's latest movie as I have feel that there is always something extraordinary about his films. Rangeela, Sarfarosh, Ghulam, Lagaan, Rang De Basanti and even Mangal Pandey (which I thought had a strong performance from him) are all a testament to that belief. I was a little skeptical about this film as it appeared from the promos to be a very ordinary film.I was also wary of the film having an overdose of melodrama. So I was a little unsure entering into the cinema hall to watch the movie. The opening credits of the movie have an imaginative style. It was clear that something creative and beautiful was in store.

Ishaan's new art teacher (Aamir Khan) suspects that he is dyslexic, and helps him to overcome his disability. Towards the end of the school year Nikumbh organizes an art fair for the staff and students. The competition is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, the runner-up.

When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh.

Anyway, to put it in record, AMIR is my favorite actor. Was. I was a great fan of his films like Jo Jeeta Woh Sikandar, Akele Hum, Akele Tum and Sarfarosh. I declare that SARFAROSH was one of the most perfect Bollywood films ever made, after SHOLAY. But then, Amir started going over the top.. letting his character, looks and mannerisms overshadow the successive films. These later films may have been flops or hits..but the charisma of Amir was gone. The ham and the excessive mannerisms remained. And these include Lagaan, Mangal Pandey, Dil Chahta Hai, Fanah and Rang De Basanti. Similarly, is TZM so great? There have been umpteen films on a troubled school or a troubled student or child and a master coming and solving all issues. From Sydney Poitier to Naseeruddin Shah to Nagesh Kukunoor. I think Rockford was a much better film than TZM. What TZM conveniently forgot that an entire school cannot be held at ransom by a teacher (well meaning, no doubt), to cure physiological / psychological problems of a single student. A school is no place for mind games. A great number of students face one problem or the other, in a session and a magic wand of a single teacher cannot solve (and should not solve) these problems. But apparently, not only Master Awasthi, but even the teachers were cured of their problems after Nikumbh, a teacher, entered the school. Preposterous and impractical. The best of intentions but divorced from reality. Hype weds success, but practicality falls by the roadside. Sorry, folks, but Rockford remains my favorite school story, even today.",

Most of the actors are complete hams (with the exception of Ishaan himself), with the prize going to Big Brother. The film exploits every stereotype imaginable to the extent that the characters are mere cartoons - one wonders whether the episode where the students draw caricatures of their teachers was intended irony or not.

What a masterpiece and rare jewel among the usual crap we get served from Hollywood.

268,30 December 2007,vishal_ek,10, This is by far the best Hindi movie of 2007..hands down !!,"I wish I had more than 2 thumbs up to show to the entire crew of this thoroughly engrossing film. The best part about this film is how the directors and the story writer have taken ordinary examples from our daily life and portrayed them to the T. There were times when I was able to correlate with the actors regarding todays growing competition, pressures that students at such a young age face and are expected to cope with.Darsheel Safary is simply superb !!. This film makes you laugh, cry and at times leaves you in awe with how Darsheel is able to portray his character.Emotions run high at times and its very good.Way to go Aamir and Mr Gupte, hope to see more of Aamir directed films in the future !!",

270,31 December 2007,thatsdileep,10, The Perfect Movie,Taare Zameen Par is a perfect 10 pointer movie. It is flawlessly directed with meticulous attention to detail. The performance of the kid (Dharsheel Safary) is awesome. Its just unbelievable for a small kid to give such a matured performance. Aamir Khan rocks in every department. He was brave enough to accept a concept like this which doesn't include commercial aspects. It shows the behavior of parents towards their wards in the existing Indian educational system. The movie delivers a strong message in an effective way. Songs of the movie are very situational and are apt. Job well done by Shankar-Eshaan-Loy. All in all a very heart touching movie. Taare Zameen Par is the best movie for at least the past and next 10 years. It is a must watch movie.,

I heard a lot of people saying that the story's based on ""Special"" Children but it's not and even if it is it's an effort to promote them, their qualities & abilities rather than over shadowing them. Dislexia, isn't a sickness but in a way a blessing in disguise, for all those mentioned in the film like Leonardo Da Vinci, Einstein & zillion of others have after all done wonders for us. coming to the cinematic aspects, as a film student i would grade 10/10 when it comes to production,direction, music as well as animation. simple & to the point.",

Ishaan actually try to tell something to his parents at the beginning but communication type was not usual and parent did not accept professional help, Ishaan is really very important example for parents who not understand children's behaviors. Aamir Khan is always try to show small points in life with his works which is we start to forget in this days. Musics are like always wonderful, acting is very good, and I have to say boys in school did very good job. Highly recommended.",

278,1 January 2008,amitkripalani,10, A masterpiece!!!,"Well, Taare Zameen Par is a masterpiece. Great script, Great performances, Outstanding direction and I can go on and on. For script the credit should definitely go to Amol Gupte. Its really beautiful. Darsheel is outstanding. Performance at its peak. Hats off to him. Tisca Chopra is great. Aamir, the actor, all I can say is as brilliant as ever. In fact brilliance is a norm for this guy. Trust me any other Indian actor who would have been in his place and had not even performed half as good as him would have been praised by media and himself like he is some kinda god and would have tried to hog the limelight towards himself from the wonder kid darsheel. But for Aamir, such performances are just regular. That's the standard of this man. And he doesn't have any pressure of hogging the limelight. He is only worried about the end product i.e. the movie and how will audience react to it. And the movie has been treated beautifully. Simple yet complex. Lovely direction. Perfect treatment for the script. Guys vote 10 for this movie. And Aamir, Thank God u made Taare Zameen Par.",

A masterpiece..and Bollywood must feel proud that such a movie is produced here!!An all time great movie!! TZP.. though,based on dyslexia,an uncommon and rare subject for movie-makers....has an universal appeal. Movie has been dealt with such a perfection that it has become a masterpiece. Aamir khan has dealt with the subject of dyslexia to bring into the focus of parents that how tedious and difficult the life of children become when they are burdened with high-expectations. Even if a child is not dyslexic,he should be dealt like a ""CHILD"" ,and not just a means of fulfilling his/her parents' expectations. What a child feels and how he tackles the situation when all of a sudden,when he is still merely 9-10 years of age,he is sent to a boarding school.This is presented with such a perfection that it is heart-touching.",

My son was mesmerized by the brilliant cinematography in the first half which captures the wild imagination of Ishaan (btw - they share the names). I was taken aback by the simplicity portrayed by him - I guess everyone one of us went back few years to the dreamy world of fantasy. You can so easily identify yourself with Ishaan - who anyway likes to read books, do homeworks, get bullied; but then everyone likes to catch an hour extra sleep, find a way to draw a picture of thought works, have a child's day out. At least, I admit I have done most of them and yeah given a chance would have started bunking schools in my early days.",

284,2 January 2008,ashwini-617,10, A Heart-Rendering Story,The movie touches upon a subject that is very relevant in today's times especially in India. The director comes directly to the point and the mood is set from the first reel itself. All the characters are true to life and the artistes have given memorable performances. The child actor(Darsheel Zafary) enacts his part with the utmost maturity and Aamir Khan plays his supporting part well.A special mention of the music of the film. The music is in-sync with the mood of the film and the lyrics are spot-on as they aptly describe the goings-on and take the narrative forward. Kudos to Aamir Khan for carving out such a cinematically brilliant and commercially viable piece of art.,

It teaches many valuable lessons and it shows us that everyone is special and good at something, no matter who they are. Aamir Khan is great in this movie, and this movie really gave him another great movie in his amazing career. Darsheel Safary, the child actor, did excellent and really surprised me. The direction and story was marvelous and inspiring, and out of the ordinary. The music was also good. This movie is a very inspiring movie that makes you really think and it is very emotional.

There are movies that make you laugh, that make you cry, that inspire you, that terrify you, after watching them you fall in love or are in complete awe, but rare are the ones that make you feel liberated. And that is what Taare Zameen Par does. I can't think of another piece of art that has given me this feeling of liberation before. I am writing a blog on the movie.

290,8 June 2020,icc-12655,8, Classic,Although Bollywood releases 100s of movies every year but few of them has really left a mark on the audience for a long time. I am pretty much sure that this movie has done an excellent job for all those people who are creative but not good in academics.

The lady who sat besides me has weeped for the Maa song. It stimulates the adulterated mind. The songs are the best assets. They have been placed at the best position in the movie. The Ishaan's acting is obviously the best I had ever seen. No Shahrukh, Amithab or even the Leonardo can make such a film. There is difference between acting and involving. Other act and Aamir involves. Tare Zameen Par is the best example. You could see OSM it is just filled with our sense to touch the fun. But TZP is the one which awakens you as you watch it. The Music is the best one I ever heard. you can see the story line, it is pretty difficult to compose for a less profile film. But SEL has done a tremendous job. Nor even Rahaman can do that. What an Involvement? Amazing. Especially the Maa song is a chart buster, for which a special community is created with 500 members. This is the first strange thing that ever witnessed by me-a community specially for a song in Bollywood. The way a dyslexia child should be treated is pictured in a sensible and also in an emotional way is amazing. Parents should learn the lessons after watching this film. No child is born less intellect, all are geniuses, but it is the parents who make them less intellect through their reviews and behavior.",
294,29 August 2018,kltfalcon,9, A wonderful movie,"Another good Indian movie that I have seen. A boy with dyslexia as well as hard to write, became separated from the school. People see him different, see him as a child stubborn. The school tear away him, parents did not understand him. Parents care about their children but they are superficial. They see when their children are sick or have problems they can feel, but they never try to understand their children, give their children a chance to understand them, eventually there will be a wall between them. , but it will get thicker. They think that giving a child a pecking allowance, or paying attention when it falls is a concern, or give the child in a good school, a good teacher is interested, choosing a good major for him is of concern. But is that really true? Attention must come from two people trying to understand each other, then from that understanding to care for one another. But here the parents do not really care about the children. The mother still loves him, trying to give up his career to teach children, his father is always looking for a good school for his children, teaching him to become good (by force, scolding). The lonely boy in this world. But he still has a good brother, although he still does not understand his brother. His life only really changed when a teacher really understood that boy.",

From starting till end, every second of the movie was worth it. Beginning on a humorous note, the movie slowly moved into a space with an emotional aura and ended on a successful, happy note. The dialogs, the story and the acting of each and every character was very simple and very realistic and thus it didn't feel like that they were acting. At times, there were few scenes in which even I, a guy of 24, couldn't stop my tears. This movie has an international feel and leaves a message on our mind, on parents and on potential parents.

As a teacher, it is particularly important to understand them from the root, analyze the problems from the essence and take effective solutions. In China film kubah the teacher told us that read the child, is not a simple observation of children's performance at ordinary times, use performance test them, but should always use appreciate the vision to see the child, always with tolerant attitude in the face of the child, in children each error, find common ground, find out the root cause of the hidden under those errors, give the children more patience, warmth and love, never give up each child, with a hug and a kiss, a smile to care for children, encouraging children to every little progress, let the child a little bit of regain confidence, find happiness.",

We used to go through all the scenes in the film in our daily life.(In fact we thought to join our child in boarding school for the next academic session).

Darsheel Safari as Ishaan Awasthi, no doubt takes the cake, and his performance, especially being a child artiste, is nearly flawless. Another gem that this movie unveils is in the performance of Tisca Chopra as Maya Awasthi, who brilliantly portrays the part of a mother torn between conventions and love for her son. Even Vipin Sharma as the belligerent father has done a fairly good job.

Taare Zameen Par has made a place in my heart through its message about the wonders in a child's brain and the way the message touched my heart. We should not understimate the power of the brain even if it fails in the easiest of works. The brain is a mystery, no one knows how and when it unveils its secret. Through systematic approach, it is possible to remove the mask of incapability that enshrouds the brain and open the windows of ingenuity. Support, care and generosity are the medicine to cure the brain's inability to shine like the sun. Stars are whirling amongst us. It is the duty of the parents and the teachers to recognise them at the appropriate time, provide confidence and inspiration for their lives to succeed in order to make a memorable and useful change to the world. From the disappointment at not being able to overwhelm the rising obstacles to the happiness at having achieved the unpredictable, Taare Zameen Par makes a illustrious mark in the history of the world of film-making.",

And Ishaan doesn't seem to get anything in class. When he faces far more problems than his parents can handle, he will be taken to a boarding school for 'discipline'. Things are no different at his new school, and Ishaan has to deal with the trauma of separation from his family. One day a new art teacher appeared on the scene, Ram Shankar Nikumbh, who greeted the students with joy and optimism. He broke all the rules of 'how things are done' by asking them to think, dream and imagine, and all the children responded enthusiastically, all except Ishaan.

He could be just another kid in the world: he likes to play with his dogs, daydream in the middle of a class or meal; go around the city and wonder at the busy the environment; watch fishes swim in the aquarium, gutter or pond; make toys out of anything he picks out on the street; and most of all he loves to draw and paint and he's very, very good with colors. But there's one thing, he can't seem to read and write properly. He usually gets low grades in his studies, his teachers would occasionally scold and punish him for being an idiot and his father, who unfortunately is a perfectionist, would sometimes beat him up thinking he was just being lazy in his studies. His mother just didn't have a clue and how to help Ishaan go through with just reading and spelling. When all hope is lost, Ishaan's father sends him to a boarding school thinking that its rigid discipline could help the boy get the marks (like 95.6% in all subjects?). There Ishaan suffers more punishment and psychological torture. Hey, a dyslexic boy sent to a boarding school alone? The boy was almost suicidal at one point but miraculously, one temporary teacher came along, thought about why Ishaan was always sad and frightened, understood Ishaan and helped the kid by treating the boy's dyslexia. Ishaan regains his confidence, passes his school exams and happily reunites with his family at the end of the school year.",

This is an example of freedom of thoughts. I cried much during the movie... It is fulled with mercy, tenderness, love, humanity and success. It also encourages people who have different abilities than other people. Famous people who were mentioned in the movie made me search about the problem of Ishaan. I learned much about this, and concluded ""differences are what we need"". I wish that all teachers are like Aamir Khan in this movie which would save the world!

Rather too long first part becomes even boring at times, but the second part is well done and is gripping. Overall a good movie to watch.

There is not one flaw i found in the movie, the actors have done a tremendous job, the songs are overwhelming, the story, the screenplay, everything is just awesome. But more than anything else what stood out for me was Aamir Khan's direction. The portrayal of the character of Ishaan and the poignant scenes between Aaamir and Ishaan leave indelible imprints on the viewer's mind. Aamir as an actor is a perfectionist but after seeing this movie i feel Aamir as a director has surpassed Aamir as an actor. I have seen other threads comparing this with Black but i think that not only was black borrowed from a Hollywood movie but also TZP is a more real movie. TZP is not about Darsheel Safari, nor is it about Aamir Khan but it is about childhood, and how parents put such tremendous amount of pressure on their children that they lose faith in their abilities. This movie teaches parents how to believe in their kids and let the kids believe in their strengths. I think this is a must watch movie for kids, parents, teenagers and every lover of Hindi cinema.",

For dyslexia he can't perform well in academic and slow learner.In our society many of the children suffer from dyslexia at their childhood .Some of them are well established now. Parents should understand the situation instead of giving them punishment which can effect their child mentally. Like normal any usual parents Ishan's parent also giving important to marks, homework and his father sometime behave very rude for his poor academic. They never identified their child but his teacher Nikumbh sir identified Ishan in different way art teacher and motivator who found Ishan is an artist . He found the good thing from Ishan among all the odds.If there was not Nikumbh sir we can't found out the star an artist Ishan. The song MAA everytime I watched and felt the relation between a child and mother emotional song I can relate the situation and that scene when he has drawn some pictures how slowly he became faded from his parents when he went to Boarding school this scenario make me emotional every time.

One important note to mention is that it only repeated the same beats ever so slightly, making up for it with its emotional connections from characters. I also felt like many of the film's villains were painted to be completely cardboard baddies, including Ishaan's dad and many of the teachers, who I expected to have more depth of character. If the first act had been shortened down a lot and if the second act had condensed the forces of antagonism into a character who we could explore more, the film would definitely be the better for it.",
346,27 January 2008,strawberryclouds,5, Emotional Manipulation at its best!,"I had just warned a friend that the film is not as great as it has been made out to be, and today after seeing it he called me from Mumbai saying how disappointing it is. We both feel the film is very plastic in its intention and extremely pretentious. There was a perceptible manipulation from the very beginning to make the audience go through the emotional ride,which was made to climax in such a way that most people would not be able to help control their tears. But exactly how honest and true was this film in its endeavor? My friend said he just could not connect with the film, and exactly like the observations of 'Just a red herring', even I realized some time after the initial effects wore off that the entire story-line is a 'one-liner' - ""challenges faced by a dyslexic child in a society like India, where understanding about such challenges are limited to say the least'. Trust me, although I found a film like Om Shanti Om absolutely disgusting, meaningless and stupidity epitomized, looking back I think the makers of OSO were more honest and genuine in their approach.They made it absolutely clear that they were making a completely melodramatic,over-the-top,loud and exaggerated 70's spoof.TZP, on the other hand, is also loud,melodramatic and over-the-top in the garb of being sensitive,delicate and intellectual. Its like finding that the lady you always thought to be Audrey Hepburn is none other than a disguised Mallika Sherawat! I'd like all movie lovers to refer to certain comments and reviews made on this site itself about the film 'Munich' by Spielberg. There is this one sequence - famously referred to as the 'little girl in peril' shot. Spielberg showed how some assassins while attempting to eliminate one of their targets get shocked on realizing that they may kill his innocent little daughter instead etc. This single sequence drew widespread negative criticism from movie-watchers, who said that Spielberg was manipulative, unnecessarily dramatic and cheap in using the audience's sentiments to elicit emotional connection by such a pedestrian method. Aamir is no doubt one of the best we have, but if we are truly looking at using the wonderful medium of movie-making to tell stories, and not just a method of proclaiming our intellectual capabilities - we should probably start being a bit more matured at using it.",

In fact, I'll further admit that I did shed a tear or two at the end, however, being of Indian origin I'm allowed to be over-emotional about everything as it's in my blood. Hell, I even cry watching Oprah sometimes  come to think of it I might have a problem, maybe I need counselling or something. I might start a club; 'Over-emotional Indians Anonymous', get in touch if you want to join! Anyway back to the film. The performance by the lead 'kid' Ishan, played by Darsheel Safarywas, was outstanding and young Darsheel will certainly have a bright acting future ahead of him. Aamir Khan's direction was very good and the film was, by and large, a good one, which entertained and ticked most of the boxes of a commercial 'feel good' movie. However, was it a classic? Did it resonate so completely with me that I will remember it as one of the best films I've seen? Alas, no.",

It is the epitome of excellence. I'm short of the best words that can be used to describe this movie. The music is so touchy and at the same time very deep. You need to listen it with your heart.

382,22 January 2018,anoushkabarua,9, An amazing view inside a child's world,"Beautiful thought behind the story..that everyone can grow up to their maximum potentiality and capability if they are motivated with best of intentions. 
second strongest point is the way the animated n creative world which is conceived inside a child's mind has been depicted in this movie..the train around Ishaan's head..the birds..the numbers playing inside within his mind in a flying saucer..the way he sees fishes inside a small puddle...beautiful animation in those scenes..
Third strongest point is the use of music to show what is exactly going on in terms of emotions inside Ishaan's heart and soul..the pain he is going through because his mum n dad didnt tried to understand his disability of not recognizing particular alphabets..the pain of being alone in a new school with new people and friends all of a sudden without any thought given to his adaptibility with new situations..also strong attention to minute details like poor motor skills and restlessness..being lost in his own world..which we associate with Dyslexic..
Fourth strongest point is it shows a beautiful character development within a span of maybe a semester when Ishan develops from a strong to weak to again a much better version of himself where he feels finally like himself..
Fifth strong point..Tisca Chopra..the way she emotes through her eyes where she dosnt have to speak but she gets it that her child does have this problem when Aamir comes to meet them..she finally is able to see the way her son must be feeling..
Beautiful bond between a mother and a child..a bond between two brothers..a new yet trustable bond between a teacher n student..a typical day which goes in every Indian home..overambitious parents..yup..this movie showed so many things and taught us how we treat our kids to fulfill our ambitions..yet we forget that they are beautiful beings wihtin their own rights n abilities..

It is an outstanding movie! It completely blew me away. Darsheel Safary's performance was magnificent! His portrayal of the emotions of the Dyslexic Ishaan struggling with life, his family's despair, and an unprepared and therefore unsympathetic education system was perfect! I should know as I have been there. I have experienced the same at school and reacted in the same way. I have a son who although does not have Dyslexia, has Attention Deficit Disorder (as I have) and his responses to conflict and beauty was a mirror image as portrayed by Ishaan played by actor Darsheel Safary. The devastatingly sensitive portrayal of Ishaan's reactions to the variety of situations he had to contend with and the very insightful descriptions on what was going on in his head, made me weep in a way I have never done at any movie.

423,2 March 2015,nealpatel54,9, The Overview,"Taare Zameen Par, translated to ""Like Stars on Earth,"" tells the story, in India, of an eight- year-old boy named Ishan Awasthi, played by Darsheel Safary, who battles dyslexia. Ishan is seen as a troubled child that is lazy and misbehaves in school; however, no one realizes these problems stem from his dyslexia. In school, teachers fail him repeatedly because they claim he is ""dumb"" and ""stupid"" for not being able to complete remedial tasks that his remaining classmates have no trouble doing, including writing simple words like ""dog,"" and ""pig ."" The teachers are trained to discipline the students until satisfactory results are achieved, but this method does not work with Ishan. The teachers do not realize that Ishan cannot understand the material because of the wiring in his brain and not because of a negative attitude. Nandkishore Awasthi (played by Vipin Sharma), Ishan's father, comes down on Ishan the hardest because he wants Ishan to be like his older brother, Yohaan (played by Sachet Engineer) who is much more successful academically. Nandkishore repeatedly states that Ishan will not be able to compete in the real world if he does not start doing well in school. After Nandkishore's last straw has been reached, he sends Ishan to a boarding school to improve his grades. Ishan meets his influential art teacher, Shankar Nikumbh, (played by Aamir Khan) at the boarding school. Nikumbh, as he is referred to in the movie, previously taught at a school for mentally handicapped children and realizes Ishan is dyslexic. Nikumbh also discovers Ishan's talent of painting which acts as a release for Ishan from the everyday struggles he encounters because of his dyslexia. In the end, Ishan learns to deal with his dyslexia, with the help of Nikumbh, and greatly improves in his academics. Equally as important, Nandkishore learns the error of his ways in not supporting his son though his difficulties and promises to strive to be a more encouraging father.",

427,24 September 2017,sarmahanimesh,10, Tare Zameen Par,"According to 'Wikipedia', this film is known as ""LITTLE STARS ON EARTH"" and the title is exactly portrayed in this film. I don't usually watch Bollywood much, but I have watched this film more than 20 times though I am somewhat late to review this film. If I have to describe this film in a single word I would love to say it as an ""INSPIRATION"". This film gives motivation to the children who are talented in another field(s) rather than in the field of education. I would sincerely like to express my gratitude towards Amole Gupte, Script Writer of 'TARE ZAMEEN PAR' for composing such a sensitive story. In this film Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi an 8-years old boy, whose parents weren't aware that they had a dyslexic son. Much to their ignorance, Ishaan was a talented artist whose talents weren't recognized by his parents nor his teachers at his school. Once ""Nikumbh Sir (Aamir Khan)"" went to visit Ishaan's parents on an off day. When he visited Ishaan's room and went through his notepad he was surprised to find that Ishaan perceives the world in a different way and his notepad clearly uncovered his talents. When Nikumbh Sir asked his parents about the reason behind sending Ishaan to the boarding school, they whined about his failure in the third standard and compared him with his elder brother Yuhan but they never attempted to investigate the matter of his failure instead they bound him to go to the boarding school. Nikumbh Sir tried to explain Ishaan's father about his ailment as well as his talent, yet they refused to hear anything such, instead they give him an excuse of the competitive world awaited outside and they also categorized Ishaan as a mentally retarded child, hearing this Nikumbh Sir criticized them adding that Ishaan is a child of above average who can process differently. This scene of the film excited my outraged toward Ishaan's parents, they could have affectionately asked Ishaan about his failure instead of scolding or sending him to the boarding school, and by doing this they would have found that Ishaan doesn't have any enthusiasm for studies rather he is keen on Art, and they ought to have sent him to an art school instead sending him to a school where he can't work with his talents. Just Ishaan had understood how he experienced a terrible stage living apart from his mother, and the lyrics of the song ""Kho Naa Jaaye Yeh / Taare Zameen Par"" played in the background still leave me moist-eyed. After Nikumbh Sir returned from Ishaan's house, he started his next class by handing Ishaan Ishaan's notepad which he brought from Ishaan's house. Ishaan was stunned to see his notebook before him, as he never expected that Nikumbh Sir would visit his house. Probably Nikumbh Sir planned this class for Ishaan in order to inspire him. He started giving examples of some great personalities around the globe who suffered from Dyslexia among them Albert Einstein was one. I think, what Nikumbh Sir had done in his class was a motivation for Ishaan and too for the other children whoever watched this film. The climax of the film proved that everyone has a unique talent which is not the same as other, as in the art competition the other faculty members and a few student couldn't paint appropriately like Nikumbh Sir or Ishaan had done, however, this doesn't imply that they don't have any talent, or they can't-do anything in their life, they might be talented in some other fields. ~sarmahanimesh@gmail.com",

433,26 February 2019,shehryarahmed-17820,10," Children are like stars in the world,","The Bollywood film 'Taare Zameen Par' portrays a strong and important message that transcends through culture, race and religion. The title of the film directly translates from Hindi to 'Stars upon the ground.' The director Aamir Khan uses this metaphor to enlighten audiences of the idea that children are like stars in the world, and that every child is special in his or her own way. Unlike the conventional bollywood film that consists of romance, comedy, fight scenes, songs and more romance, Taare Zameen Par is not an entertainer, but rather an eye opener.",

This understanding is totally unfounded. In the Bollywood film Taarr Zameen Par, Ishaan Awasthi is a young boy with dyslexia and has to face the many challenges of the world that doesn't understand, or acknowledge, his learning disabilities. However, that all changes when Ishaan meets an art teacher with an open minded perspective towards students, teaching and education. Ram Shankar Nikumbh, the art teacher, sees all students as having the potentioal and capability to be taught, however some students might just require teachers to use alternative methods in the classroom.",
435,16 November 2018,morganchakov,10, Spectacular Film,"Taare Zameen Par is a movie produced by Hindi Cinema that absolutely tugs on the heart strings of the audience. As a fan of Bollywood films, I have to say that this particularly movie has many qualities not often seen in Bollywood films. Taare Zameen Par, roughly translated to 'Like Stars on Earth"", is a heartwarming film produced and directed by Aamir Khan that depicts the struggles of a 8 year old boy that struggles academically. I am not ashamed to say I shed tears of both sadness and happiness watching Ishaan, played by Darsheel Safary, struggle and overcome his learning disability. I believe this film allows for open conversations about learning disabilities such as dyslexia and shows the range of emotions that those who are affected experience. Another Bollywood film that I think had similar goals is ""My Name is Khan"" directed by directed by Karan Johar that stars Shah Rukh Khan playing a muslim man that has Asperger's Syndrome. My Name is Khan quickly became a worldwide phenomenon for the message that it is telling. One of the biggest similarities I saw between the two films is the internal struggle both the main characters face. Neither want to be discriminated by their peers because they are different, and neither realize that their differences allow for their special abilities to shine.",

437,26 February 2019,umarf-02823,9, Individual versus society:,"Let us take a closer look at the constraints that are imposed on us by our environment. Our freedom of choice and our freedom to develop in whatever direction we wish is certainly limited by the society. For one thing we cannot choose what we don't know about. If we have never heard of the profession of painting, we will not have the option of entering it.
During childhood we learn a great number of things via reward and punishment. We are praised when we behave in a quiet and well- mannered way at Aunt house and we get hissed at when we comment on the fact that school is boring. When a child attempts to communicate are met with indifference or impatience the child understands this reaction as a personal rebuke, as a message that means , 'You are not worth listening to'. This self-image imprinted in us early on by parents and teacher will later accepted by us as our self.
This movie shows the love of Parents and their reason for turning things hard but it is there believe that there would be change if they turn things around. Most of the time there is not a lot we can do about our biological make-up or the fact that problems arise in our environment. we have to learn to live with the realization that we have.
This movie teaches a lesson to the guardian as well as teacher how to behave their child or student, behaving abnormal or very different from the behavior of common children. In here, I can say that teachers play an important role, either to break or make our students ""shine as stars"".
But the thing in the movie that during painting competition the student made fun of their teachers and had made their funny sketches on the papers which encourages the students to make funny sketches of their teachers to make fun of them, it may be their physical body or face structure or the attitude or style of teaching of the teacher, which should not be done in schools in our societies.",
