When I watched it again recently it hadn't lost any of its impact. SCARFACE is, quite simply, one of the best films in the ""gangster"" genre that there is, if not the best. The simple tale tells of Tony Montana's journey from being a lowly refugee, to working in a cheap mobile caf√©, to working for a drug lord's assistant, to working for a drug lord, to becoming a drug lord and then losing everything due to his own mistakes.",/

6,30 June 2001,jhclues,8, Dynamic Performance by Pacino,"In 1983, Director Brian De Palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an American gangster, and that he did-- with the help of a terrific screenplay by Oliver Stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast. The result was `Scarface,' starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles.  The story begins in May of 1980, when Castro opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, to allow Cuban nationals to join their families in the United States.  125,000 left Cuba at that time, for the greener pastures of freedom in America, and most were honest, hard-working people, thankful for the opportunity they had been granted.  But not all.  Among the `Marielitos' who streamed into Florida, approximately 25,000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of Cuba's jails-- criminals considered beyond redemption, who Castro had merely wanted to be rid of.  And they, too, saw America as a land of opportunity, even as Al Capone had considered Chicago some fifty years earlier.  And among the most ambitious was a man named Tony Montana (Pacino), known to his associates as `Caracortada.' Scarface.",w
7,6 February 2011,murtaza_mma,9, A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Pacino gives a heart-wrenching performance as the modern-day Macbeth,"Brian De Palma's Scarface depicts cinema at its most macabre, and not for a second does Stone's cut-throat screenplay go awry in its unforgiving attempt to limn the naked reality associated with drug mafia and the kingpins who govern it. Brian De Palma's unquenchable thirst to mimic the gore reality on the celluloid didn't go well with the MPAA, which rated even the highly censored third cut of the movie as 'X'. Brian De Palma and the producer Martin Bergman arranged a hearing with the MPAA and roped in a panel of experts including some narcotics officers, who testified the movie's verisimilitude to the conditions prevalent in the drug underworld. Their testimonies greatly convinced the members of the rating board, who eventually condescended to give an 'R' rating to the aforesaid third cut of the movie. Brian De Palma used the pervasive kerfuffle as a subterfuge to release the unedited original version of the movie instead of the curtailed one and kept this fact surreptitious for months until the movie was released on videocassettes.

8,17 September 2011,Arcturus1980,10, My favorite crime film,"They improved on greatness for this remake of Howard Hawks' 1932 film of the same name. To my mind, this is more than a crime doesn't pay morality tale, just as Al Pacino's Tony Montana is an anti-villain rather than an anti-hero. This is deep filmmaking not to be dismissed in so superficial and parochial a manner.",r
9,24 May 2020,kosmasp,10, Say hello to my little friend,"One of the most recognized quote from a movie ever. Even to those who haven't seen the movie. It's sort of Pacinos equivalent to De Niro ""You talkin to me?"" scene from Taxi Driver. Not comparing those movies of course. If you want to compare movies, you could compare this to the 30s original with Paul Muni. A movie that Pacino watched in a cinema and made him want this movie. Made him want to be as mesmerizing and have a powerful role. Add Oliver Stone and others to make this happen and you have an amazing movie.",w

13,19 January 2013,ma-cortes,8, Violent chronicle about the rise and fall of a dangerous gangster and easily ranks as one of the very best in the mobster genre,"Remake from classical movie titled Scarface (1934) , in fact , De Palma's Scarface is dedicated to Ben Hecht and Howard Hawks. When Fidel Castro opens the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, he sends 125,000 Cuban refugees to reunite with their relatives in the United States. Among all the refugees, there is one who wants it all, his name is Tony Montana (Al Pacino reportedly stated that Tony was one of his favorites of all the characters he's played) but the world will remember him by another name , Scarface , being a fictional character . In 1980 Miami, a determined Cuban immigrant takes over a drug cartel while succumbing to greed . As Tony and his faithful friend Manny (John Travolta was considered for the role of Manny Ribera but was to Steven Bauer who is the only actual Cuban in the main cast and subsequently married Melanie Griffith) arrive in the U.S. and beginning working small time jobs importing and exporting cocaine. Soon, they are hired by Omar Suarez (during filming F. Murray Abraham was notified that he had won the part of Antonio Salieri in Amadeus) to do business to a group of Colombians. When the issue goes awry , Tony and Manny leave with the money and flee rapidly . Soon after , Tony meets with drug ringleader Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia , outstanding as a rival gangster) and falls for his boss's girl , Elvira (Michelle Pffeifer , Kay Lenz, Glenn Close , Kelly McGillis and Kristy McNichol both reportedly wanted the role , but De Palma turned them down). Later on , Tony reunites with his mother and sister (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).",6
14,22 September 2020,Xstal,6," Scars & Torture, Visible & Unseen...","It's a story about a misogynistic psychopath with sister issues who develops drug and alcohol dependency and carries an exceptionally large chip on his shoulder: Al Pacino captures that character to perfection. Without him the film would probably have been forgotten some time ago, the rest of the cast are quite forgettable in comparison but so is the story which adds little or no value, unless you have aspirations along the lines of the scarred man or recognise some of his attributes in yourself or someone you know.",3

17,14 June 2016,PredragReviews,10," ""The World Is Yours""","""Scarface"" is one of the greatest of all mob movies. It's an epic crime drama done with style and care. Brian De Palma presents a film that ignites the screen with a great screenplay by Oliver Stone and an amazing performance by Al Pacino. For those unfamiliar with the story, Scarface follows the path of Tony Montana, a charismatic Cuban refugee, who arrives in Miami looking for the American dream. Tony's up-front and tough personality makes him go right to the top of the cocaine underworld. However, no one, as they say, stays at the top forever. There are consequences to his success, and as Tony learns, money and power can't give you everything. A special mention should go to Michelle Pfeiffer, who superbly plays Tony's love, in what was her first major film role. This film is not for the faint at heart as directer Brian De Palma 3 times had the film rejected because it had and X-Rated certificate. He literally had to take the people who give the certificates out to court. Although grotesquely brutal this movie could teach kids good lessons that crime does not pay as when he gets to the top of the underworld his life corrupts through cocaine and he ends up killing the ones he loves and watching ones he loves die in crossfire.",/

19,5 January 2005,ed56,10," A Brutal, Uncompromising Masterpiece","Arguebly Al Pacino's best role. He plays Tony Montana, A small time hood from Cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in Miami, and he does it with the only two things he's got in this world, his balls and his word, and he doesn't break'em for nobody. Starts as doing jobs for a big time Cuban dealer, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quickly goes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friend Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon he has an eye for the boss's sexy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat from Tony to his position, he attempts to assassin Tony but with no luck. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. the film has a great supporting cast among them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumpy gangster, another familiar face is Harris Yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake down Tony, Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's young sister. Credits to the Ecxellent screenplay by Oliver Stone. This film is one of Brian DePalma's Brightest points in his long ups and downs career, you can see this guy is very talented. The movie has a magnificent look to it. Also pay attention for two memorable scenes: The one at the fancy restaurant (""Say goodnight to the bad guy""). the other is the final shootout where Tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 assassins that invaded to his house. this is certainly one of the most impressive endings to a movie I have ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and crime movies it's a must-see. For the rest of you it's highly recommended. 10/10",r
20,26 September 2001,michaelRokeefe,7, Taking advantage of the land of the free. Crime does have a price.,"Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE paints a picture not easily forgotten. Al Pacino turns in a stunning performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee than becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his self made kingdom of crime in Florida. This gangster flick is harsh, violent, loud, gross, unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word ""f--k"" the most number of times. Almost three hours long, and yes it can get repulsive. A stout hearted constitution keeps you in your seat cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord.",e
21,3 January 2015,Hitchcoc,8, One Man Show,So many have already commented on this movie that I don't have much to add. I just want to say that this violent black comedy has one of the most memorable characters in all of movies. It's also one of the most quotable films of all time. As the immigrant Tony makes his way to the top by dropping people in huge quantities and manipulating a system that plays into his hands. He is a juggernaut and why he rises as he does when he is often clueless is quite amazing...and we buy it. Pacino takes his Corleone character to the Nth degree by pretty much taking the humanity out of him. We love him; we hate him; but we certainly can't ignore one of the most off-the-wall performances of all time.,f

23,4 August 2013,Mr-Fusion,5, Lays it on pretty thick,"Walking away from ""Scarface"", I can't shake the feeling this is an operatic comment on the American dream, by way of a gangster movie at least; that an immigrant can climb his way from societal dreg to drug kingpin and get the girl on the way. That's powerful cinematic stuff, and I can appreciate that. I guess my problem is in the execution; Pacino's cartoonish performance, the drawn-out narrative, the unbelievably overbearing score. It's got a good cast and the personnel behind the camera is accomplished, but subtlety and nuance are not its virtues. Which I guess is the point, but it gets old after a while.",=
24,13 August 2015,BA_Harrison,9, Make way for the bad guy.,"Recently, Calais has been under siege from refugees/immigrants fleeing Eastern Europe/Africa, desperate to get into the UK via the Channel Tunnel.

Time for a re-watch, methinks (any excuse¬Ö).",t
25,22 March 2009,dbborroughs,6, 25 years on the film is now more a parody than reality,"Unintentionally Hilarious but viscerally moving about Tony Montana from Cuba who comes to the US, becomes a drug lord, a junkie and dies in a spectacular shoot out. Brian DePalma's film remaking the Howard Hawks film from the 1930's works on some levels despite being so silly as to become a comedy. Blame Oliver Stone who's script is overly ripe. And Blame the cast who over acts like there is no tomorrow.I saw the film on Christmas day 1983 and was floored by it, even though I knew some of it was silly.(I thought it was one of the best films ever made) Watching it again for the first time in a couple of years I was horrified at how bad the film is. Yea the underlying themes and such are there but its so jumbled I'm amazed that anyone takes the film seriously. I have no idea why Montana is an icon for the todays gangsters since he is such a joke, unless they don't see it that way, or perhaps its like a childhood friend who loved the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, or rather the rise, he totally ignored the fall. An important movie in the history of film simply because its become such a cultural touch stone. I think its now a violent joke.",t
26,4 November 2010,Ziya90,10, A misunderstood and very unappreciated film,"Scarface is a very violent and bloody film? No, it is not, even in its time. There is a very famous chainsaw scene, of course there are killings and gunfights, but these do not make the movie so violent and bloody. Especially, if we live in 2000s when some movies with extreme violence and blood have been made. For the squeamish, Scarface might be pretty disturbing, but otherwise it is just as violent as a crime movie. Then, why do people call especially Scarface violent and bloody while Goodfellas or The Godfather are violent and bloody too? I don't know. Secondly, as I see, some hate Scarface because according to them, some people, especially wannabe youths imitate the character, Tony Montana. However, the question is does it make the movie awful? Then, let's put all the gangster movies including The Godfather into a basket and then burn it. Scarface is a masterfully directed, masterfully executed, masterfully acted and visually so stylish crime film by Brian De Palma. Scarface is a so stylish movie from the cinematography to the art direction. As for the script, I think it is Oliver Stone's one of the best works as writer (especially in terms of story editing in contrast with Heaven and Earth) I agree that the movie is shallow throughout, but not flawed even a moment. It is 170 minutes approx. so as it is understood, it is an epic! What is the advantage of the long duration then? We can see the life of Tony Montana, Scarface in detail which means satisfying. The movie or the characters are not deep at all, but personally, I did not even mind it while watching, because everything else was great? By the way, sorry, but why did you expect a deep character study? It is a crime epic and if Al Pacino is one of your all time favorite actors like me and if you like De Palma's style, then there is no possible way to dislike the movie. If you did, then congratulations, you are one of a kind. Personally, I like De Palma very much, for me, he has more than one masterpiece in his filmography like Body Double or Casualties of War and Scarface is one of them. Now, it is time to talk about Al Pacino. However, before that I want to say that this is a fast moving and ''event driven'' movie, not a character driven movie, but still Al Pacino is great in this movie and he gives a great performance. Tony Montana is not someone likable, because he is always angry, so angry and he trusts nobody, but Pacino makes him one of the most remarkable (and likable?) movie icons ever. Therefore, by Pacino, Scarface was a character who I hate and also like. And there is a gunfight sequence, one of the best parts of the movie for sure, it recalls John Woo movies and it is almost obvious that Brian De Palma was inspired by John Woo. We are talking about one of the best gunfight sequences ever. It was a 'edge of the seat' gunfight sequence and it does not happen often! so the importance of that sequence especially comes from that, but of course also it is impressive, stylish and entertaining, if entertainment is the right word in this case. Lastly, I have seen the original 1932 version and it was excellent too. Both movies are excellent in its own way. It was an early Warner Bros style gangster film and and this remake is one of the best movies of all time too.",_

The movie got panned at the time of its release for its excesses in profanity and violence....but now since we've all become desensitized with decades of this stuff, the film is now almost reaching ""cult status.""

32,25 March 2005,ereinion,10, De Palma's finest work,"SCARFACE is definitely Brian De Palma's best film and the only one that isn't flawed or too violent and disturbing. It follows the story of a Cuban refugee in Florida who eventually becomes a major drug lord through connections with a powerful Columbian cartel boss. His best friend is Manny, played by Steven Bauer in his best performance yet, who is the more humorous of the two and is the only man Tony can always rely on. More strong supporting roles by Loggia as Montana's old boss, Michelle Pfeiffer as his love interest, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as his sister whom he is sickly protective of and a fine cameo by F. Murray Abraham as his ill-fated partner who gets whacked in a memorable scene.",
33,6 August 1998,Maniac-9,10, Pacino is simply masterful,"Scarface wasn't quite the movie I was expecting to see, but that's not necessarily a bad thing either.  I had been watching all the Godfather movies a few days before I first saw Scarface so I was expecting a normal kind of mafia story.  It's a crime story and all but not a mafia story, I thought it was cool as hell.   Al Pacino is such a great actor, he does like a metabolic change in each role.  He doesn't even seem to be the same actor.  You actually believe he is Cuban refugee just as in Godfather you can believe he is an americanized son of a Sicilian mafia don.  Plus I don't think I have ever seen a movie with nearly as many cuss words as Scarface before.",

It's a pretty standard rise-to-power story that's excessive in everything it does. From the acting to the violence to the language to the drug use to the sound to the runtime, everything's over-the-top. I get that excess is the point, but it's just unpleasant to watch at times.

A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for the American Dream. Montana then becomes the ""king"" in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his empire of crime in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This movie has around 180+ F-words and is almost three hours long. This movie is entertaining and you will never get bored. You cheer for the Drug-lord, and in some scenes you find out that Montana isn't as evil as some other Crime Lords.

39,28 May 2006,kenjha,7, Overdone,"Violent and inferior remake of the 1932 classic is entertaining but overdone. The plot is lame. Tony goes from (dishwashing) rags to riches in a few months. He shoots people all over the place but when he's got to kill a man for Sosa he employs an elaborate plan with a car bomb. The finale is the definition of ""over the top."" Pacino seems to be doing a parody of a gangster, with the annoying Cuban accent (you keep expecting him to say, ""Luuucy, I'm home.""), the angry scowl, and the tough guy talk. DePalma's camera work is at times overly flashy, thereby becoming a distraction rather than enhancing the action. He also could have used a decent editor.",

42,26 December 2006,drystyx,1, helped begin the decline of gangster movies,"Before ""Godfather"", cops and robbers movies were exciting and entertaining. Then came the long boring gangster movies which tried to make us understand gangsters. It doesn't work. ""Scarface"" suffers from lack of likable characters, lack of believable characters, lack of plot, lack of motivation, lack of a logical sequence of events, lack of fun, just a lack of everything. It is not an exciting movie. You fall asleep before you hear the action wake you up, and then you don't really care. Pacino seems only capable of portraying a pretty boy, even with a scarface, he tries to stay pretty in each scene. Its not totally his fault. The writing is pitiful. Pacino's character comes from a multitude of beautiful Latino women, and we are to believe he lusts after some middle aged looking, raggedy looking, rather pitiful looking, pale lifeless ordinary blonde? Clearly a woman wrote this part of the script. No man could ever buy into it. The plot fails, too. Pacino magically becomes a top master criminal because....well, no one knows why. Nothing is explained. Nothing makes sense. But then, the modern gangsster films are all that way. We don't understand the characters, partly because we have no idea what's going on. Just a bunch of lines, mean looks and blood and gore we actually sleep through.",
43,6 May 2022,gbill-74877,6, Excessive,"Al Pacino is great and there is a certain Shakespearean arc to his character who comes to America and through ruthless ambition becomes a drug overlord only to find emptiness at the top, but it's a story that's just not for me. The excess and lack of nuance of an Oliver Stone screenplay combined with Brian De Palma's direction (oof, what a combination), the cheesy synthesizer soundtrack, and the anti-immigration undercurrent all leave me a little cold. Stereotypes and misogyny are served up in heavy portions here, amidst the memorable lines brimming with equal parts machismo and profanity. Aside from Pacino in brownface, there are also several others, like F. Murray Abraham, which is pretty damn unfortunate for 1983. If you want brutal violence and male fantasy, this is your film. Otherwise, brace yourself for 170 long minutes.",

45,23 February 2020,hooma814,9," ""Say hello to my little friend!!!""","This movie was epic!
Thoroughly enjoyed it from start to end. I had always wondered why Al Pacino was so highly regarded. After watching this and the Godfather its now clear why. He gave such an authentic performance, it was hard not to believe that Al Pacino was not in fact Tony himself. The opening and ending scenes for me were some of the best. The brillance of Tony's quick thinking mind to be able to stand up to anyone. He really was fearless, standing up to all these people. But at the same time he was so broken. There was so much character development in one story, unlike many I had seen before. The cast and the set design as well as the music all contributed so well to take this movie to the next level.

56,14 June 2010,zardoz-13,10, One of the Seminal Crime Films of the 1980s!,"Brian De Palma's contribution to crime movies is a splendid but extended remake of the Howard Hawks classic that toplined Paul Muni. Al Pacino of ""The Godfather"" trilogy plays the eponymous Cuban refugee sent to America during the infamous Mariel wave of boat people when Castro emptied his jails. This lengthy but engrossing drama depicts how the protagonist made it to the top of the world. When they made this movie in 1983, the producers probably had no idea about either the controversy that would erupt during the lensing in south Florida or the ultimate cult status that this corrosive tragedy would generate. Eventually, the film stirred up so much ill feeling that Universal had to complete the shooting in California. De Palma and scenarist Oliver Stone took one of the three greatest crime movies of the century and exploited a historical event to make their gangsters reminiscent of the immigrant gangsters during the era of the first ""Scarface"" movie. Indeed, at one point, Tony Montana explains that he learned English because his American father took him to see Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney movies. Considering that the film runs just shy of three hours, the filmmakers do a good job of balancing the violent empire building scenes with Tony's domestic life. Composer Giorgio Moroder's disco soundtrack is surely one of the classics. Lenser John A. Alonzo's widescreen color photography is elegant. Squeamish people should probably avoid this trigger-happy, shoot'em up saga, the chainsaw scene in the bathroom of a motel is pretty gory stuff.",

I loved the scene where he was sitting in his office with a table full of coke and he seen that there is a hit going down and the people were outside of his office and he said one of the most famous lines that will live forever, ""You wanna play, you wanna play, come meet my li' friend!' love it!",
58,5 December 2004,bronty,2, What's worse: the film or Pacino?,"Having seen this over 20 years ago on cable, I recently decided to see if the ensuing decades could make me appreciate this, and the answer is ""NO"". I thought then, and think now, that the film overall and its lead performer were and are over-hyped to the point of hysteria. I even call into deep question Pacino's standing as one of America's ""great"" actors; for all those who love ""The Godfather"" series (I'm not one of them: I think they, too, were equally overdone), I suggest taking a gander at such ""classics"" as ""Author! Author!"" (ever wonder why he doesn't do more comedy? A quick glance at THIS will tell you why). In the hands of the unreliable De Palma - for every ""Carrie"", you get ""The Fury"" - a man who, despite his blatant desire and attempts to be Hitchcock reborn, is at heart a lover of the overblown cinematic image, Pacino is allowed to give his tiresome ticks and actor's tricks full display in a part that SHOULD have been played with subtlety. If the film is watchable - and it basically is NOT - it is due to the scenery-chewing; Pacino hardly starts with nibbling; no, instead he swallows each shot whole, inspiring his fellow actors to go overboard along with him. For each laugh one has at the actors' expense, however, one needn't be Cuban to be even slightly offended: SURELY the makers of this film could have found more than ONE honest-to-goodness Cuban (co-star Steven Bauer being it). The accents, particularly Pacino and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, are akin to those in the old ""Speedy Gonzalez"" cartoons - you almost expect poor old Juan Valdez to be trotted out, too, just for good measure. But how about the story-telling, the technical aspects? Well...once you get past the hammy performances - quite a struggle, believe me (you'll be tempted to bring out the cloves and pineapple) - and the assuredly overcooked direction, you are left with something that rambles on for nearly 3 hours, though with little reason beyond wanting to become a modern-day ""epic saga"" a la ""The Godfather"". As for the LOOK of the film, it's not an especially attractive one: the print on cable - no, I haven't seen the DVD and don't care to - STILL looks downright muddy at points, as if copied from an old slow-speed video tape, though this could be as much to do with pan-and-scan as anything else. The much-lauded score by Giorgio Moroder is, THERE: not memorable, as with ""Midnight Express"", but not a total failure and it DOES fit the cool, shiny-plastic beauty of Miami and its denizens as shown in this film (everyone seems to be dipped in either oil - the ""natural look"" apparently never made it down in Florida - or sweat, for Pacino never seems to stop perspiring, which is understandable, what with the effort it must have taken to overact AND speak with some marble-mouthed, faux-Latin accent). No matter, though, what the film looks like, or how it's written (poorly; example: Michelle Pfeiffer, sporting one of her other noses, just disappears towards the end), or how long it goes on (and on, and ON, AND ON...), people watch this for the acting, the violence, and the love of the ""f"" word (uttered 182 times), and they have dubbed this and ""The Godfather"" as ""classics"", all of which goes to show that if you say it long enough, some people believe it.",

60,4 June 2001,irajoel,1, Scared For Life,"I can't really understand why Brian DePalma felt the need to do a remake of Howard Hawk's 1932 gangster masterpiece Scarface. The original is so good and tough, lean and stark, short and to the point. This laughable mess goes on for an unbearable three hours, and has as its centerpiece, it's anchor, its star, Al Pacino who is simply dreadful. What has happened to this once exciting actor who gave so many memorable performances in the early seventies. His downfall may have begun with this very film, and he has gone downhill ever since. All his recent roles & performances seem the same, they blend and melt into one. His performances have become lazy, fat and dishonest. At times it seems as if his performances are yelled at us, and this is usually mistaken as intense and powerful acting. When he tries to be subtle and quiet,he comes off as insincere and all method. He was fun in Dick Tracy, because he was playing a cartoon, and his overacting was exactly right for a comic strip. His performance was all make-up. His Oscar for the cheap & sentimental ""Scent Of A Woman"" was undeserved, but as Oscar saw it he was long overdue. So in Scarface we have Al playing gangster with a bad Cuban accent which comes off as a bad Mexican accent. DePalma & the screenwriter Oliver Stone have change the Italian criminals of the original to Cubans, and instead of booze we have coke, instead of the fine subtle Hawksian direction of the original we have De Palma's over the edge misdirection. To be sure DePalma has made some terrific original films. Carrie, Sisters, Dressed To Kill and The Untouchables immediately come to mind, but Scarface is not one of them. There is however one top notch DePalmian sequence and thats the chainsaw in the motel bathtub scene, but thats only a few minutes in a three hour flick. The violence and gratuitous cursing wears us out, and after awhile it all becomes meaningless and stupid. I envy Michelle Pfeiffer who in the film gets to walk out on this mess. Also in the cast is F. Murray Abraham, one year away from winning a best actor Oscar and oblivion, & Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio who in the flash of a snort goes from being a good sweet girl to a raging party girl,unconvincely I might add.  The film also looks ugly and the recently deceased John A Alonzo's cinematography is muddy and common. Not exactly a highpoint of American cinema.",

Perhaps having already seen pretty much every other good gangster movie before having seen this one, I kept thinking that the Godfather, Goodfellas, Carlito's Way etc just blow it away... maybe if I'd seen Scarface before any of those, I'd think the opposite. But there are other reasons: More than any other gangster flick, it really is a film of its time, the 80s, which is great as far as it goes, but personally, I found a lot of it too staged and stylised - the scene where Tony goes to kill Frank and the cop coming to mind, it just seems overlong and ultimately disappointing; all you want is for him to go in and blow them away, but it's just really drawn out and then somehow when he does shoot them, it seems like a real anticlimax.

Al Pacino plays a Cuban refugee named Tony Montana who arrives in Miami Florida in 1980. He eventually enters the crime wave quickly rising to the top as a feared mob figure. This is a different direction for Brian De Palma who previously made the entertaining thrillers Dressed to Kill and Sisters. Pacino is a commanding force whose jealous rage earns him enemies, and destroyed relationships. The screenplay details his up rise but also delivers a riveting climax where enemies storm his mansion with a thirst for blood and revenge, and Montana hoisting a large gun in challenge, ""Say hello to my little friend!"" Michelle Pfeiffer plays his wife whom he charmed away from a former boss but she eventually leaves the chaos. Steven Bauer plays partner in crime Manny who makes the mistake of becoming romantically involved with Montana's sister. She is played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio whose joyful reunion with Tony vanquishes under his over protective jealousy leaving her aiming her own guns. Robert Loggia is featured as a drug lord. Crime doesn't pay, and the ruthless will fall hard until all is left is a scarred legacy. Score: 9 / 10",

Basically scar faced (from childhood) Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Golden Globe nominated Al Pacino) and his friend Manny (Golden Globe nominated Steven Bauer) start out doing small time jobs, e.g. burger stand, before being hired by Omar Suarez (Last Action Hero's F. Murray Abraham) to pay money to Columbians for some cocaine. The deal goes wrong, but they leave (after some chainsawing) with the money and coke. Soon Tony meets drug kingpin Frank Lopez (Independence Day's Robert Loggia), and falls for his new boss's girlfriend Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). He grows even bigger with power and greed when he kills Lopez and Bernstein (Bean's Harris Yulin), and he has basically become the new godfather of illegal drugs, mostly cocaine. He obviously finds out the hard way that power doesn't last, when a gang with machine guns surround his house in the great climax. With many violent moments, very strong drug use (including a pile of cocaine on the table, which Tony pretty much dunks his face in) and containing 278 swear words, one every 36 seconds, including 226 'F' words, I love it. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Giorgio Moroder. Al Pacino was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Robert De Niro) on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 61 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Say ""hello"" to my little friend!""), and it was number 31 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die.

You will always be judged but Pacino character just showed us that is a man with great principals and that he has big morality but doesn't like to be bossed or played. Incredible plot that shows us a mans path from very low point in life to getting almost on top and then falling down in this case being killed. Plot is incredibly written with a lot of development in characters that later on show us their determination in doing something. With a lot of violent scenes that are always brought by our bad characters and are shown in many scenes. Pacino provided one of his many great performances and just gives us great experience. 3.5/4,

What's different about it is that he is playing a Cuban, instead of the usual Italian crime boss, which adds a whole new dynamic to the setting. The main issue with it is that it was made in the '80s - a decade of film making which it isn't suited for. The original was made in 1932, which seems a better time and setting for the film. If it was made ten years before hand, or ten years after, it would be one of those movies where not much else could touch it. Also, the amount of times a man high on cocaine can be shot is proved false by this specimen! Remove the synth music and film it in another decade and it's a 9/10.",

Unlike some of his other performances, such as in the Godfather films, there is nothing subtle about his character. Instead, he's bigger than life and seems more like a comic book villain than a real life drug kingpin. And compared to the original ""Scarface"" with Paul Muni (which itself is far from subtle), it looks even more over the top. Additionally, the film seems violent and nasty just to be violent and nasty.

The film makes a strong point against being a criminal, well you might cheat the system, but it will not accept you and you will not feel free, I guess it's a case when if you do an honest living, your soul is clean and you feel somewhat free...

This was the worst casting I've ever seen, and the soundtrack will make you retch if you can't find the mute button fast enough. Pacino, who has talent, displays none of it here. Just a ridiculous over the top bad accent job. It's all just so cliche and contrived. His overprotective bit towards his sister is particularly grating. A few good scenes but not the ones you're thinking of. I liked one involving a helicopter and rope. One with a hotel bathroom. Otherwise a few cool classic cars had the most shine in this pathetic romp. Michelle P.

This is one of Brian De Palma's highlights, though his genuine material was Hitchcock like topics. It is for him what DEPARTED was for Marty Scorcese: one of his best films, but with ingredients which he was not familiar with; Irish mob, and cops for Scorcese and Gangsters instead of psycho killers for De Palma. However, in this masterpiece, De Palma uses several of his usual tricks, editing tricks just before and during action scenes. And one of his trademarks, the opera like directing and photography, that we also find in so many of his movies, is also here. But this time, it is a damn bloody opera, gruesome, at a gigantic scale speaking of violence and excess.

Enormously dated, 'Scarface' probably would've been more enjoyable during the ""Cuba"" scare, tail end of the disco era and ""excess of the 80s"" period. What 'Casino' and 'Goodfellas' had going for them, was they were both already period piece movies (and much more enjoyable than 'Scarface.') I realize 'Scarface' was a remake, and Oliver Stone and Brian De Palma seemed to want to take a new, ""updated"" present day take on the older ""Al Capone"" story line, but they didn't seem to make it timeless. Such as, for someone who's never seen 'Casino' or 'Goodfellas' and finally decide to view them, it would be as if they saw it for the first time in the 1990s. 'Scarface' pretty much had to be seen in/around 1983 to be completely enjoyed. Also, it might have been more shocking with all the F-bombs, violence and unpredictability of the rise/fall of a madman mobster. This is not to say it was a bad movie and Pacino did pretty good, though at times hard to understand and like most of his movies, he looks half-asleep throughout.

158,25 February 2021,mfellipecampos,6, Nice,"Stone, Pacino, and De Palma must really think that ""Money is not everything"" is an original and profound message ... Scarface is often remembered as one of the essential gangster films. Although The Godfather saga is the most revered of its kind, this one is the film whose phrases and scenes are the dream of any young adult with limited knowledge of cinema. But after about 30 years, the feature that took so long to be cool ironically now looks just like any action movie from the 80s, with well-done shooting scenes. Only. Besides, it is just that show of endless indulgence that marked his time, with a lot of style and little substance. Scarface was the game changer for many careers. For Al Pacino, his performance here can be seen as the beginning of his over-the-top climb, which slowly but surely started to erode his technique, turning him into nothing more than a caricature of himself, an exaggerated and less inspired by the great actor that was once. For Oliver Stone, it was the film that revealed it, having released a string of successes a few years later, giving him some Oscars. And for Brian De Palma, it marks the point where his love of visual extravagance began to dominate his sense of narrative discipline. His later works would, at the very least, be irregular. In remaking the 1932 classic directed by the iconic Howard Hawks, Stone and De Palma change the scene from Chicago to Florida and change the central crime, from alcohol smuggling to cocaine trafficking. The original was inspired by real-life gangster Al Capone, who would have liked the film so much that he had several copies ordered. While the two films feature a character who rises to the top getting rid of his former bosses, this version adds the twist of having a foreign protagonist. By making Tony Montana a Cuban immigrant, the filmmakers tried to make some kind of satire from the American dream, but everything is done in an obvious and too clich√© way. We can't care about the plot or the main character, as his personal arc is poorly presented and developed, besides sounding manipulative, as if Montana ""cares"" for his mother and sister to erase the fact him being a murderous drug dealer. And the ending is particularly cynical, as it tries to make us sympathize with him for the fact that he was unable to kill a woman and a child ... Well, then all the other hundreds of people who had their lives destroyed by the drugs he trafficked do not matter huh? It is a film that lacks empathetic figures and originality. In fact, Scarface is a film that seems much more interested in showing bloodbaths in the best way than building a minimally interesting social commentary, or presenting scenes with wider repercussions and meanings. No one can deny De Palma's brilliance in terms of set design and choreography, but once you stop admiring a particular scene or deliciously caricature and ridiculous construction of Montana de Pacino, there's not much else to justify the length of the film. In short, it is a film as deep as a teaspoon. Scarface for may seem like a luxurious and excessive film, but the truth is that it has nothing to say other than the old sermon ""Crime does not pay"". The problem is that it takes us a long time to know who Tony really is, and when we do, we don't like it. Here, all the boxes of a clich√© criminal tale are checked: Fast rise? Checked. Dazzling and ostentatious with money? Checked. What of the pedestal for ambition and arrogance? Checked. If the script had been less predictable and the final 20 minutes had been better directed, this could have been an excellent criminal drama. You can argue that this is the film that directly influenced Tarantino at the beginning of his career, but poor is the work that survives only from what was made of it and not from what it did. Scarface is a bloated and indulgent epic that leaves you delighted, confused, and exhausted at the same time. To appreciate it, it is necessary to suspend a great deal of critical thinking, to treat it as a sensory experience, and not as an intellectual challenge. Despite all its flaws and excesses, it is still a good choice for an uncompromised session with friends.",

Al Pacino is excellent as Tony Montana, the crime lord badass from the streets as a refugee and cocaine king. You can't possibly say that this movie was terrible. It is so opposite from that. The music was great by Giorgio Moroder, the plot was amazing like no other crime movie, and the voice of Al Pacino's as Tony Montana is so significant and it's like, ""How can you do that."" I was so fixed on watching this film that I had so many chills down my back watching it. It's a classic and it has been talked around a lot for over 20 years. This is my 5th favorite film and what the hell is going on you critics, this should definetly get in the 250 movies of all-time!!!",
160,11 June 2021,jrkdany,8, Great,I for some reason postponed watching this movie. I didn't want to watch another gangster movie by Al Pacino. But since I had nothing else to watch I watched this movie and fell in love with it. The screen play by Oliver Stone doesn't lag anywhere. I never felt the movie was almost 3 hours long. And Al Pacino was mesmerizing. He portrays his transformation from a nobody to leader very well while retaining the passion throughout. Michelle Pfeiffer was looking great and the dinner scene was awesome. Every scene has been crafter very well. The sets were awesome. The ending was perfect.,

162,13 November 2014,christophe92300,6, De Palma has made a better gangster movie : Carlito's Way,"In 1983, Brian de Palma, with the help of Oliver Stone, delivered Scarface, one of the most iconic gangster/mafia movie. The scenario, which depicts the lightning rise and fall of a Cuban political refugee who became a drug lord in 80's Miami, is solid overall but the movie undeniably would have benefited from a tighter editing because certain passages are a bit long, and the more the story progresses the more this lack of rhythm is noticeable, in the last 30-40 minutes it evens seems nothing is going on. Pacino is perfect in his role but you have to like the style, he's not far from overacting as often happens, and his character is so antipathetic that it's hard to relate to him which is inevitably penalizing. The rest of the cast is anecdotal, just think of Michelle ¬´ trophy wife ¬ª Pfeiffer. Scarface represents for a lot of people the quintessence of gangster movies, while other productions such as Goodfellas or Carlito's Way, from the same Brian de Palma, did a much better job.",

Even though I don't think Scarface holds up to those movies I still think it succeeds at a level where the Howard Hawks movie didn't. I can't think of another person who could of played this role better than Al Pacino, and yes, that does include Paul Muni. I don't think it's a coincidence that the filmmakers chose the same person who played Michael Corleone. Both characters are bad, use violence for personal gain, and are incredibly human. Maybe it strays away in the famous final scene when Tony Montana is riddled by a swarm of bullets, not to mention the scene where a stoned-out Pacino inhales a mountain of cocaine on his desk. Still, Tony Montana is one of those characters that stays with you despite the fact that he's a monster that would kill a person at the drop of a hat, and drop the hat himself. The violence in Scarface is not there to entertain, but as a way to reinforce the self-destruction of Montana; so when it does get to that point where you see a crowd of people overwhelm Montana's mansion, you know that there's no way he's going to get out of this one. I'm not really use to seeing DePalma's work outside of his well-known thriller movies like Dressed to Kill and Sisters. Still, He's a master at building up suspense.",

Viewers will gain an insight into police corruption, an issue that has gained media attention in Melbourne lately with greater exposure of Gangland killings. Is an honorable drug lord who values the lives of children more virtuous than those who follow the law yet exploit others? The climax of Scarface resembles the apotheosis of violence witnessed in Taxi Driver. Beyond the superficialities, Taxi Driver and Scarface have much in common. Al Pacino's acting is excellent. The film focuses on Pacino's character to the point where other characters become meaningless. The ending, although satisfying, seems to suffer from a touch of contrived nihilism.

More style than substance but this is Brian De Palma, after all. The Oliver Stone script is full of memorable lines, not to mention an epic number of F bombs.

The film is about Tony Montana, who is a criminal from Cuba, who comes over to America. He starts out by working in a fast food restaurant and then soon ends up working for a drug lord in Miami. Tony, soon makes a name for himself and starts to deal drugs and becomes a crime lord himself. The film deals with drugs, deceit and violence as well. Scarface, has become a very popular film and has even become a cult film with a big legion of fans who quote the films and wear t-shirts of the main character. There is also a video game of this film in the works. I saw this film because of the numerous recommendations I got to see it and plus I'am a big fan of director Brian DePalma, but overall I was disappointed with the film. It was basically nothing more than a big budget Hollywood action film. The film had no character development so you hardly knew the characters and the movie jumps around a lot and often gets muddled in it's storytelling. The film also lacked Brian DePalma's great direction. He usually has a dark stylish look but this film does not have it. It looks too Hollywood and too mainstream. The film feels this way too. It really did very little for me. It was entertaining but I'm probably not going to see the film again or remember much of it in later years.

This is for sure Pacino's greatest role. I prefer Pacino's performance in Scarface rather then Godfather (Another Great Classic). There are Three particularly Superb Scenes in this movie. First, Al Pacino and his Friends go for their first exchange with the columbians and end up almost getting killed via Chainsaw. Second, Al Pacino is given a task, to help in a assassination, but a women and her kids get involved and Pacino's stuck with a dilemma. Finally the last Fight Scene was Brilliant. Say hello to my little friend is one of the famous speeches. Pacino shoot dozens of guys on his own in his mansion. The whole movie entertains, thanks to Pacino.",

But like Blade Runner, it slowly gained a massive cult status and aged like fine wine, finding its place in cinema history. Written by Oliver Stone (who partook in 'method writing' & directed by Brian DePalma, this violent and daring film is a relentless masterpiece, a study in rags to riches, criminality and narcissism to the extreme. Al Pacino is absorbed in this character that we forget its Pacino (the only other actors to do this that comes to mind were Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull and Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now). This movie is so early 80s in terms of its look and production design/sets that Miami becomes a character unto itself, just as cocaine the monetary driver in this movie does. The movie plays out like a dream...the events unfold in a surrealistic way, things get more disturbing and chaotic and ruthless as it goes on. The main character and his co-hort are confronted with so many challenges and their daring sacrificial attempts at making it rich at the expense of anything/anyhow/anywhere is sonewhat cool and amusing, all in a disturbing way. The music score is novelty yet epic, and it's no wonder that the rap music culture took heart to this movie due to its romance with violence and brutality and the flexing of money. This isn't for everyone but worth a look- it's one of DePalma's finest commercial films and kudos go to Universal's executives who saw fit to invest in producing this film because it makes sense and gets better with every year that passes. The 4k bluray looks amazing. Technology is so good these days that the amount of film grain seems to be easily controlled. For an old film, this digital transfer makes this film look like its shot in the early 2000s.

236,21 July 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9," Scarface lathers itself in memorable quotes, stylised violence and mountains of cocaine.","Brian De Palma remade the 1932 classic and exclaimed to Hollywood ""say hello to my little friend!"". Modernising it to colossal heights, thus creating one of the greatest gangster epics of all time. Relentlessly referenced in pop culture, my expectations were quite high. Suffice to say, they were met. We witness the irrepressible rise of Cuban refugee Tony Montana, as he enters the illegal drug business, and the eventual fall from decadence. The classic, to quote Drake, ""starting from the bottom now we're here"" narrative has consistently been a reliable structure. Enabling central character development whilst building an intimidating environment that allows for personality adaptation. The fictional Montana is a testament to this. Observing the manifestation of greed, lust and envy disguising the apparent loneliness and selfish behaviour of Montana. Money powers him, and De Palma's focus on the requirement of desiring the world makes him both ambitious and arrogant. Even when all can be achieved, his artificial greed beckons him to want more, consequently leading to his demise. A fascinating character study that was brought to life by the legend that is Pacino. Exaggerative, hyperactive, aggressive and commanding. Pacino embodied Montana and gave life to the drug kingpin. De Palma's lightning pace seamlessly combined frantic stylised action with punchy dialogue, whilst also introducing frequent long takes to spice up the Miami beach. Stone's screenplay is littered with memorability. ""Her womb is polluted"", ""you want to play games?"" and enough F-bombs to redefine the word profanity. Seriously, every other word! Plenty of exasperated action, particularly the mansion shootout, that excessively assist the visualisation of the crime world. My only criticism is with some of the song choices in the soundtrack, it comes off as trashy and I think Scarface is better than that. Despite the overlong runtime, this is 80s gangster mayhem and the sheer craziness from both Pacino and De Palma adds to the bloody charm.",

A powerful performance by Al Pacino, several notable supporting roles and a story that's so eye-opening and fully developed are a few of the top reasons anyone watching this film today would call it great. So why nothing? Was it ahead of its time, or not far ahead enough? The only possible explanation is the latter.

It stays in the mind because it tries so hard to set a new record in violence and terror. I wonder what kind of reaction the makers of the movie expected from their public. Fear? Revulsion? Anger? Lust? Many scenes really are over the top and completely ludicrous, but I guess that is intentional. Why on earth should a Colombian drug dealer during an encounter in a stuffy hotel room be armed with a gasoline powered chainsaw? The chances that he'd himself die the first of carbon monoxide asphyxiation once he started the engine would be high. Well, maybe these are the wrong questions to ask and one should just enjoy (if that's the right word) the action.

Al Pacino is truly amazing in his role as the rising drug ""king"" Tony Montana. From his accent, his voice, his walk to his presence everything is amazing. Every scene he is in is nothing but flawless and this is mostly because he put his whole heart in this particular film and you could totally see it. Then, there is absolutely no one else who could have played Elvira, but Michelle Pfeiffer. She was perfect for this part in every aspect.
The film has the power to keep you ""glued"" to the screen from its start to its memorable and impeccable ending, a quality that not many films have. It is a movie that will never be boring, no matter how many times you've watched it and I know this, because every time i revisit it, I feel more and more amazed by its greatness. Brian De Palma put so much passion in this project and you could feel it while watching the movie, as the shots and the directions were absolutely mesmerizing. The soundtrack is the ""cherry"" of this movie, as most of the music is placed in the right place at the perfect time and it actually makes you feel part of their world.
I truly believe that this is one of the greatest films of all time, as it is flawless in many aspects and this is why everyone should watch it at least once in their lifetime!",

Most other movies always have something in it that could be different, or mistakes in it that you wonder how it could have gotten past the directors and editors, or something that just doesn't make sense. But this movie, in my opinion, has absolutely no loose ends! The single thing I didn't like about it was Manny's accent. It sounded too fake, and it just annoyed me every time I would hear it. Although I was upset Tony killed him because of the obvious reasons, I was a tad relieved that I didn't have to hear that accent anymore. I didn't understand Tonys mom. Why would she turn her only son away. No matter what he has done, you don't turn away a child. ESPECIALLY when he is throwing that kinda cash at you!!

The movie did strike a resemblance to 'Al' but his last name gives him credit to view his film and because of that the miser in us is not going to be a coward. 
Activity to shoot such a picture with ingredients like 'drugs' or 'chessboard' from the poster shows that the knowledge we have of cinema needs another alter ego to persevere. The self did not succeed to bring a revenue singularly; did with sight and through sound of guns and visualization of events that can lead to catastrophe or millions of dollars.
'Scarface' a movie that shocks; stuns a loaded gun to be prepared for the legal battles to control the usage of a substance that is yet allowed in 'Coca Cola' syrups. Man's historical evidence shows that ate and sniffed curiously every metal and tried to turn it into gold like an 'alchemist' but did he put 'cocain' leaves into his mouth; he has.

Everyone should probably agree that it has one of the greatest acting ever witnessed in film history in Al Pacino's perfect portrayal of the ruthless Cuban crime boss Tony Montana. How it didn't win best acting Oscar could probably be explained by the fact that unfortunately Ben Kingsley near perfect and riveting portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi (also one of the best in cinematic history) happened to be in the same year.

266,19 March 2023,lucascastaneda-56244,8, Unexpected,"Wow, I TRULY had no idea what I was getting into. There were some amazing scenes in this film, but at the same time, there were some incoherent and goofy aspects. I'll start with the cons of the film. Some of the accents were shoddy, the plot was floaty at best, and I HATE ( and I mean DESPISE) the minor antagonist who puts the final shell in Montana. The plot would jump around, not that there is anything inherently wrong with that, but it never truly explained how Tony got his business to work; How he started to distribute to all the major cities out of thin air. Other than all of the things that irked me, there was plenty of amazing aspects to this film. First of all the ""The World is Yours"" scene is magnificent. Montana is menacing after taking out a major rival, and he spots that marker in the sky. Beautiful. This film has an abundance of iconic scenes, not just including the one I just mentioned. This is what makes the film special. Overall, a great film",
267,19 November 2015,paolopuharic,10, A brilliant movie! MUST see!!,"Probably one of the best mafia movies I've ever seen. Scarface shows the life of Tony Montana (Al Pacino) and his rise to power that soon leads to his ultimate downfall. The movie is rich in story and character performance. Tony Montana, is shown as a Cuban refugee who seizes the American dream and rises to the top as a powerful drug lord. His pride which was the very tool of his rise to power turns to be his ultimate downfall which makes the character ever more interesting. ",

I guess that's what I'd expect from a site that ranks Return of the King as the best movie of all time. Anyway, back to this plate of movie-puke called Scarface.",
269,11 June 2017,stormhawk2021,10, One of the crime movies for all times,"""Scarface"" is one of those must see films that everyone who loves crime thrillers needs to see, if only for the intense character portrait of crime. This three hour gore fest tells the tale of Cuban refugee Tony Montana, who rises through the ranks of a crime syndicate until he is the reigning king of the drug scene in eighties' Miami. What fascinates viewers is the fragility of the organization, and how fraught with violence the film is, initially putting a lot of people off. Tony only gets as far as he does because he trusts no one, is only out for himself, and revels in the blood and cocaine madness of his empire. While he comes to the United States bedraggled and full of vinegar, he slowly morphs into an opportunistic henchman, happy to be seen as the working man, oblivious to the death and destruction of his actions, and jealous of everyone and everything that stands in his way. He is our protagonist but he is also our villain, so bloodthirsty and autonomous that it's pretty frightening to think he holds most of the power. Though Tony breaks down doors in order to become the king, he also steps on a lot of people to get there, so it's obvious that his world will crumble around him quickly. The casting is perfect for this film. Pacino portrays an embittered, hate-filled Montagna, which makes for a volatile performance. Michelle Pfeiffer stars as the prize that he longs to grasp within his claws, while being both frigidly cold and hopelessly angry, making for a great dynamic between the two characters. Besides this film being great in its realistic depiction of a drug enterprise, it's also a great crime film. The seventies and eighties were rife with stories of kingpins and gangsters, but this is the first that shows the arrogance and self-indulgence of cocaine, and its place in real life 1980s Miami. This film both demonizes the exploits of its lead while also showing the extravagance that crime comes with, and that's an intense balance to find. Brian de Palma masters this balance by showing the motivations of the character, and the lengths he is willing to go to find success in his adopted country. That's why this film stands the test of time, and illustrates the grandiosity of the drug trade in full.",

Almost all of that brilliance derives from Al Pacino's performance...on every level Tony Montana should be a truly contemptible piece of work: a treacherous, foul-mouthed, coke-addicted murdering gangster. But you empathise with him, if not sympathise. You understand his mentality, you can see the twisted logic to his actions. He plays the big guys at their own game and does it smarter, more efficiently, and even more honestly than they do. He wastes anyone who stands between him and what he wants: he falls for his boss's girlfriend, so he ends up betraying his boss, shooting him and marrying his girlfriend. Nice behaviour!

276,26 October 2022,ThomasColquith,6, Decent Gangster Film,"I just saw ""Scarface"" for the first time. It is of course a well-known film and I expected it to be pretty bad but it was actually mostly decent and watchable. There are some graphic scenes and I wouldn't call this an enjoyable watch, but in terms of telling a story of a fictional person in a real time and place as a tragedy I think it works, so I rate this a 6/10, on par with the newer ""Loving Pablo."" Slightly better than ""City of God"" 5/10, but worse than ""Godfather"" 7/10 in my opinion. It really depends on if you like the genre I think, not for everyone, and you have to be in the mood. I'm also not sure if the music was cool or not, I could see it either way, and it was a little low to be heard. And I don't love the often moving camera. The film could have definitely benefited from a little less style and shooting, and more intricate plot details, and a shorter run-time. In summary, I think another reviewer ""rafaelloskipros"" hit the nail on the head regarding the theme, this is a film about entropy -- the natural decay of life, of all things. Our lives and accomplishments and even our physical possessions, everything in this world decays rapidly, regardless of what you do.

""Scarface"" is more than that. Without giving too much of the plot away, the movie is about Tony Montana, a small time crook who dreams of making it to the top. The film very explicitly follows this man's life as he starts in the slums of Florida as a Cuban immigrant with nothing who ends up climbing the ranks to a big drug dealer that owns a mansion. The morals of the plot are the American Dream¬Öfor a gangster and how it tears a person apart. ""Scarface"" is in a sense a tragedy. A man who gets everything only to destroy what he truly loves. ",

Al Pacino dives deep into the character as Tony Montana the immigrant from Cuba who has been lured by the lifestyle of the riches, gets in the act of becoming rich on whatever the given choice of work, overcoming any kind of obstacle obstructing his vision. One can feel the humane side in him when he cares for his sister so much like a little doll, when he exhibits his uncomfortness and anger on knowing that he is going to bomb the car that has the targets wife and children and his respect for Maama. The scene where he yells at Manny warning him to stay away from his sister, his telephonic conversation with Sosa are some scenes where his powerful acting can be witnessed.As a whole , a great movie and one can only understand actors like Al Pacino and De Niro are definitely the inspirations and encyclopedic reference of acting for actors to come by for generations !!!!!!",

Violent as the day is long and filled with something to offend almost anyone, it is no wonder that ""Scarface"" has made such a mark on pop culture. It is appealing to almost anyone.

321,21 September 2003,ferguson-6,8, The eyes never lie,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Had not seen this since its theatrical release in 1983.  Now 20 years later, I couldn't resist the theatrical re-release. Bigger screen and better sound only enhance the experience of Pacino's most dynamic screen performance.  20 years ago I found this to be a frightening film - almost overwhelming.  The periodic laughter from the audience was the telling sign of how times have changed.  We have become numb to the violence and drug abuse.  However, PLEASE note, this is NOT A MOVIE FOR KIDS.  There were at least 6 kids under 10 years old in the theatre.  Yes, times have changed, but not that much!  Michelle Pfeiffer's performance looks even better now as the lonely ice queen of the drug lords. Watching Stephen Bauer reminds me that I predicted stardoom for him 20 years ago.  Oh well, can't always be right.  Oliver Stone's screenplay is excellent and for the most part, this is DePalma's best direction.  However, in usual DePalma fashion, he goes over the top every time he wants to emphasize Pacino's anger.  The close-ups of the eyes and the increased volume would be necessary for a lessor actor, but not Pacino in his prime. Overall, the film captures the gluttony and larceny and desperation and danger of the drug underworld.  Maybe the players have changed in 20 years, but it remains a problem.  This film has turned into a very entertaining (yet violent) expose on drug traffiking.",
322,8 August 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," A good, convincing portrayal of a fictional Cubans rise to power in the underworld of America","After watching this again, I realize that I may have praised this film a little too much. Therefore, this is the more down-to-earth review. A lot of people compare this film to Godfather; granted, there are similarities, but Godfather is the better film. The entire Godfather trilogy(apart from possibly part III) is better than this film, as a whole trilogy and as individual films. Godfather has the better actors, the better script and the better film, as a whole. Sure, Scarface has some good talents, a somewhat good script, and is a pretty good film, but it doesn't compare to the greatness of Godfather. The plot is good, it has a pretty good pace, and it's fairly interesting. The acting is good, with Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer giving pretty good performances, and most of the rest being reasonably good. The thing is, Scarface is more of an action film than a regular crime-drama; it has a body-count several times the size of the one that Godfather has. What you make of that is up to you, but personally I prefer quality over quantity. Every time someone was ""hit"" in one of the Godfather films, it was special, and often unique. There were several actual shoot-outs in this film, and it quickly got fairly uninteresting, as they didn't have the intensity of a regular action film, and felt a little out of place in a crime-drama. The overall tone of this film was more violent than Godfather's tone, and, at times, the film felt like it was mainly about putting in as much graphic violence as possible. It was good, no doubt about that, it just wasn't great. I have yet to see the original Scarface, but I hear it's much better, so I'll have to check it out soon. All in all, a pretty good gangster film, pretty good crime-drama, but just inferior to Godfather. Watch it to get a good, gritty and nothing less than realistic view on organized crime in the 1980's. Listen to the great theme, maybe be shocked at the gruesome violence, and learn, that ultimately, crime doesn't pay. I recommend this to fans of gangster movies and crime-dramas, fans of Brian De Palma(I guess, though I can't really remember what else he's done that's worth watching), and people who are interested in films about organized crime. Worth checking out. 8/10",
323,27 September 2015,nicolechan916,8, Great acting with interesting portrayals.,"There is a lot of action in the film, and quite a few gory scenes which are gory enough for me to turn my head away. Considering the subject matter however, there was not as much violence as I thought there would be. What makes this movie stand out for me, is that there is structure which follows Montana's rise to success as a drug lord and when there is violence, the violence is explained.

They lived in a mindset of living fast dying young, but in reality he was never satisfied his greed ate him alive.

SCARFACE tells the tale of Cuban ""political"" immigrant Tony Montana and his arrival to the U.S. and how he attains money and power beyond his wildest dreams. You don't need to be a narc or an FBI expert to tell that Montana smells of bad luck; his demeanor, the way he talks, etc. would make him an instant suspect in any police department around the world. How he manages the get IN the U.S. is one of the movie's first flaws. It was apparent from the start that Montana was a lowlife and trouble maker. His manners and ways don't change through out the entire film. It's as though we're almost looking at a comic book character. Many people hailed Pacino's performance but I found it terribly annoying, one-dimensional. Forget if he's a nihilistic punk. His character barely shows anything different than the punk he is. Except on one scene, where he is forced to kill a person along with his family. It's the only point in the whole movie where he shows some remorse and/or compassion for someone else. The other characters, like Elvira (Michelle Pfeifer) are equally wasted in their performances. How come she ends up marrying the ""grease ball"" she so much hates? If anyone, only Steven Bauer's character was a tad more human and believable. As for the action sequences, they are far less bloody than anything on THE GODFATHER or GOODFELLAS. Sure, there's a lot of cursing, courtesy of Scarface himself. ",

One thing you can't accuse him of is glamourising the criminal life: Tony Montana is always a nasty, jumped up vulgarian, his tasteless aesthetic outdoing even Donald Trump's (although watching the film now, it's not always clear to what extent his style is being mocked, and to what extent we are merely being shown how rich men generally aspired to live in the early 1980s). In fact, Montana is so unappealing that one limitation of the film is that it's near-impossible to empathise with him; another is de Palma's decidedly unsubtle direction. Al Pacino plays the lead with gusto but there's little humanity to bring out in the character. There's certainly a grand story here (as his enemies converge on his house at the end of the movie, with Tony inside in a state of increasing personal madness, I thought of 'Macbeth'), but it lacks the richness (and any deceptive hints of warmth) you can find in 'The Godfather', or in Scorcese's best work.",

On the other hand, it looks fantastic; (Ferdinando Scarifiotti is credited as 'visual consultant'). De Palma uses colour and the wide-screen to give the film the look and feel of a pop-art cartoon and an the centre of this cartoon is a highly animated performance from Al Pacino in the title role, (he's feral where Muni was ape-like), but there's too much of him; he's never off the screen and he's acting all the time.

I watched Scarface for the first time today. What a bad joke. The performances by Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer are some of the very worst performances I have ever seen in my entire life by an actor and actress. I actually give this movie a minus 500 on a scale of 1 to 10. I only kept watching this movie to see if it pick up or got better. The movie Scarface only got worse. If actual criminals were actually as stupid as Al Pacino came across portraying Tony Montana then there would be no crime. How could the character Elvira Hancock as played by Michelle Pfeiffer ever be considered to be sexy, desirable, attractive or a sex object? Maybe a dead opossum would be attracted to other dead meat. I feel I was betrayed by the average rating of 8.3 by 454,262. I realize that signs of intelligent life are getting harder to find but 8.3? I will never trust the average rating for any movie on IMDb again. I endured 170 minutes of frustration and total lack of entertainment. It is too bad that Tony Montana was not gunned down in the opening scene and the rest of the movie could have followed the seagulls who were more interesting. Matter of fact, the seagulls were a lot sexier than Michelle Pfeiffer. It will be difficult for me to ever try to watch any movie with either Al Pacino or Michelle Pfeiffer in it.

It glorifies violence - it's not just that it is a necessary evil in the world in which ""Tony Montana"" works, it just comes across as if there was nothing in the script and the film had to be padded out somehow - so let's shove in some more brutality. There is precious little sophistication with the characterisation either - and after a while that all just grates.

It is also a character study focusing on the maniacal Tony Montana played perfectly by the great Al Pacino. I recently saw Heat and I thought he was hamming it up there, but his performance is nothing compared to the sheer extravagance of Scarface. Set in a terrifically dated 80s Miami, Tony Montana starts off with a level of bravado that contributes both to his success and his downfall. Even at the beginning he is already too macho to function, and this just slides downhill through his paranoid outlook, criminal lifestyle and rampant drug use. Unlike other reviewers, I wouldn't say he is corrupted. Rather, his character is magnified to the point where it leads to his ultimate downfall, much to the chagrin of everyone else's lives he has ruined along the way. The action scenes along the way are very violent and memorable, if sensationalist.

It is hinted these exiled people are far from being clean. They are the dregs of society and coming directly out of prison. Scarface is no exception. He is scum and scum he will remain till the end. The Americans are not lured at all, at least the police, but they are under strong pressure to provide these poor refugees with ""libertad"". As soon as Scarface gets that freedom he starts his business, from scratch and from the bottom, but he knows how to climb fast and how to get rid of obstacles and his road is punctuated with bodies or parts of bodies. In no time at all he is the boss and he is able to realize his ambition: millions from the opening Colombian route (cocaine of course) whereas those he eliminated to get in their place were only making a few grands. But the story of this man is the story of a paranoid and schizophrenic sociopath. He climbs to power and cannot see he has to share that power with newcomers. He defends his territory like a lion or a grizzly bear and his power becomes a war, a constant war in which everything and everyone is destroyed. That makes a perfect action film full of violence as if it were loaded with cocaine, but with a more human dimension in the character of Scarface himself who is impersonated marvelously by Al Pacino. The acting is so good that it transcends the pure bloody violence of the images and the plot.

If you find Tony to be a bit too over the top, perhaps a caricature of 80s bad guy, then you're likely to find Scarface to be a one-dimensional, overblown piece of fluff. But if you think Tony is a major badass whose overreactions help enhance his character, not detract from it, then Scarface is your movie. The movie is still very quotable, even 36 years later! And it's educational. Never sample your own product. Good life lesson right there, kids. Anyway, I fall into the second group. Yeah, it's outlandish theater, but it somehow works - particularly as it's set in the overwhelming 1980s. Of course, fresh-off-the-boat Tony is a cocky bastard, even with the immigration guys. Of course, he blusters his way into a coke deal, which quickly goes south. Of course, he fights his way to the top of the crime game. He's all cojones; just ask him. Couple of other notes - the entire cast is a lot of fun, from Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio (playing his kid sister) and Michelle Pfeiffer (playing his wife) to Robert Loggia (his boss) and F. Murray Abraham (boss' right-hand man). Steven Bauer, playing Tony's own right-hand man, is okay, but am I the only one who sees a resemblance to Michael Ian Black? I will say that Tony's act of bulldozing over everyone and disregarding all help got a bit tiresome, but that's in keeping with his character, anyway.

Here he plays a character who is angry, alienated, dispossessed, morally depraved and marginalized. His own mother wants nothing to do with him. His own sister is utterly corrupted by his presence. Unlike Michael in The Godfather, whose own depravity is at least blunted by the veneer of middle class civility, Tony's behavior is upfront, unambiguous, without restraint and utterly lacking in finesse. Everything he does is based on cunning and brute force. Unlike the Godfather, Tony doesn't need an organization to run his operation, he IS the organization. Nor does he pretend to be anything other than what he is, a gangster. For Tony is a product of the culture of violence that pervades society, produces characters like Tony Montana and supplies Hollywood with the material with which to make these kind of chilling movies.",

The second best is this--Scarface--a violent depiction of a Cuban refugee's rise to the top of the crime underworld. Al Pacino is at his most insane as protagonist, Tony Montana, a ruthless criminal from Cuba who makes his way to Miami is the Spring of 1980 with his best friend, Manny (Steven Bauer). As they get to know exactly what it is like in the Mafia, Tony explodes with fury and becomes the top mobster in the world. As Tony is riding high, his paranoia, greed and brutal actions make him a sought after target he can't escape. When Scarface in 1932 was released, it was a major controversy and was released a year late due to its extreme violence. Over 50 years later, similar things occur, with things almost being banned and nearly getting an X rating. This day in age, Scarface really isn't bad. Kids these days are exposed to profanity, sex, drugs and violence everywhere they go. Scarface is a very violent film, but other action directors such as John Woo and Ringo Lam have made more violent movies than this. But what is good about the violence, not like I'm trying to make light on it, is how well choreographed and artful it is. DePalma is at his best here. And the acting...where was Pacino's Oscar? After a few years without a great flick, Pacino storms back, only to have another robbery. His accent is dynamic, this style is genius, his character is ruthless and evil, and that's so good. His determination to get to the top and protect everything he has is kind of inspirational: a nobody rises to the top of the world. Every rapper's house is not complete without Scarface. Every movie lover's house isn't complete without Scarface either.",

And based on the cult status the movie has achieved, popular in rap music with loads of movie merchandise overflowing on the shelves at your local Spencer's, its love is pretty universal. Brian De Palma's classic is the ultimate depiction of the 80's cocaine scene. At nearly three hours long, it's an epic about the rise to power of one man through the ranks of the international drug trade. Based on the 1932 movie of the same name (and the novel from Armitage Trail), it follows Cuban immigrant Tony Montana as he arrives in Miami in 1980 as one of the Cuban prisoners lumped into the mass emigration to get rid of his countries worst offenders. He arrives in the States with nothing but wastes no time in attracting the attention of the crime world when he assassinates a political prisoner in exchange for his green card. From there, he uses his brutal nature and honorable business ethic to climb to the top of Miami's cocaine trade, stomping out anyone who makes the mistake of crossing him. Still SCARFACE is, if anything, a morality tale where money and power lead to paranoia and eventually a tragic end. SCARFACE is iconic and has left it's impression on just about every aspect of our culture, from music to the video game industry (pretty obvious if you've ever played ""Grand Theft Auto: Vice City"".",

While the characters are exaggerated and scenes are made unrealistic, it is still entertaining nonetheless. While watching the film and seeing Tony's slow decent into madness, I felt pitiful for him and while I wanted him to get better, I also wanted karma to catch up to him. That being said, when he meets his fate at the end of the movie I was a bit upset. I disliked Tony's actions and behavior but I still loved him as a character. Watching him push everyone that he loved and cared for away, trusting nobody but himself, it was all disheartening.

The focus of this near 3 hour film was detailing the rise and fall of a drug dealer - who wasn't portrayed in a strictly negative fashion. Although common in films today to have an antagonistic figure as the protagonist, it must have been truly shocking for it's time - that we as an audience are expected to, at parts sympathize with or even feel sorry for a man of said profession. And although certain aspects of the movie have admittably dated (the early hip hop soundtrack in particular screams of the 80s, but as a whole this doesn't detract from the mood of the film as much as is often complained) the simple storyline of uncontrollable greed and ambition and their consequences is still as easily recognizable and identifiable as it was when first released.

The movie never gets boring,with an exception to some scenes with Michelle Pfeifer (who is just annoying and in my opinion not a good actress). I understand that this movie is a remake of a movie made in 1932. Which was based on events of organized crime during the thirties. Although most of the story of the 1983 version is fiction,some elements are based on real facts of the drugs mafia in the eighties with reference (example character ""Sosa"" from a large drugs cartel) to Escobar who was a real kingpin! The performance of Al Pacino is what give this gangster movie a special touch to the genre. He is not a simple character. He is smart and ambitious and has got big ""cohones"" (balls,guts). He can be a bastard but also shows some moral when he refuses to blow up a car because the target's children and wife are also in it. Which ultimately will be the cause of his death in the end. It is nice to see the effects of cocaine on ""Tony Montana"". At one time he doesn't trust anybody,not even his best friend,with a real dramatic consequence.

Al Pacino as Tony Montana is unforgettable, and as the film progresses he sinks deeper and deeper into tragedy until his whole world crumbles on top of him.

Not family friendly so I don't recommend watching this with your kids or your gran - lots of bloody violence, drugs and bad language.

You may find yourself routing for the bad guy as Pacino's Tony Montanta can seem divided between success and gain, but with occasional morals too.

410,21 April 2018,Nobody-27,3, Not as great as it is lauded to be,"I saw Scarface when it first came out, and then again some 35 years later. Through all those years only few images from that film stayed with me - mostly how gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer was/is. This did not compare favorably to other great films which I remember to great detail, and upon watching it again recently, I found out why.
First of all, the main character, well portrayed by Al Pacino is far from an interesting of likeable character. His love of violence, dirty money and drugs may be attractive to some, but even when I was much younger, I found him entirely forgettable. There was not much reason to root for him, or even feel for him. ""A dumb, violent newcomer with (almost) no morals gets in trouble? Let's see what's on other channels...""
Then there is the story which is entirely predictable. What can happen to a violent criminal other than violence? And that's what happens. Unless you like watching violence in all it's bloody glory, you don't get anything from watching this film.
And then the story itself, or whatever story there is, is painfully long - overstretched to saga proportions to give it some weight.
In the end, between all the ""f"" bombs, low-brow action and dialogues, and characters destined for self-destruction, I fail to see where the attraction that this film enjoys comes from. In a way, I think the audiences have been had by their own penchant for cheap thrills.
Shock value? Sure. Blood and foul language? Galore. But artistic merit or inspirited storytelling with strong characters? Not even close. This is one of those films that managed to garner praise despite it's lack of quality on all fronts, except for decent acting. Oh, and don't get me started on terrible music score... it only made the film age terribly, although it's age shows even without the score. As I was watching it, I could not help but think of much older films which managed to stay fresh, films such as ""M"" by Fritz Lang or ""Rififi"" by Jules Dassin. Heck, even lighter fare such as ""Pehlam 123"" holds much better over time than this overrated, pretentious piece of sub-par, cheap ""entertainment"", for lack of better word.
All in all, a forced three star. I had to watch something afterwards just to detox from the bad experience that left me wondering why did I even waste my time on it in the first place, when even on the first viewing in the theater, back in the 80's, I was not terribly impressed.",

If it didn't come out between movies like The Godfather and Goodfellas, I am sure it would have been even a more special movie. We have a really interesting character. Tony Montana who is involved with the drugs business. Nervous, eccentric, strange, funny. Something from everything. I assume that Al Pacino is the only actor that could play such a person. He was chosen for best actor of all time and this movie made his name gold since it was silver after The Godfather. At least this is my opinion on Pacino's career. Stunning performance.

Do you think a Cuban refugee turned drug kingpin is going to be an elegant and articulate speaker? Tony Montana is a savage, and Al Pacino does a truly awesome job of portraying him.

The best movie of the 80's and one of the best movies ever. I highly recommend a movie that is impossible not to like; It is also impossible not to have heard of this movie, after all who has never heard the phrase of the end ""Say hi to my little friend"", or who has never seen that scene in which Al Pacino is watching television in his jacuzzi or until the death scene ""The Godfather: Part II,"" ""Earthquake - The Big One,"" or ""The Godfather: Part II,"" or ""The Godfather: Part II."" even to the original 1930s film ""Scarface."" Highly recommend.",
421,19 November 2004,mappciti,10, THE BEST!!,Scarface is the best movie ever made! There will never be another movie like it. This movie alone makes Pacino the best actor EVER! Regardless. Tell me who is a better actor and why. The reason that Scarface is the best movie ever is that it represents a realness of life for someone like Tony Montana at that time. It is a story of the little man building himself up to be the big man. ,

423,6 November 2006,Johnny0581,10, A timeless tale of an underdog who reached the top,"""Scarface"" is the story of a Cuban immigrant who arrives in the US through a boat sent by Fidel Castro himself to purposely send all of his criminals to American soil and crap on Uncle Sam. His name is Tony Montana (Al Pacino) Upon Tony's arrival in America, he is already spotted as a potential threat and is interrogated by customs agents who find out a little bit of his history and decide to send him to a special camp where all Cuban undesirables are sent. Some time later, opportunity knocks in the form of murdering a Cuban general, sent to prison by Fidel himself, who tortured and killed govt. officials back in Cuba and now one of those official's brother, who is a powerful man in Miami, wants him dead. Tony, his best friend Manolo (Steven Bauer), and a few other friends carry out this task and earn themselves a Green Card. But this is only the beginning....This powerful man, turns out to be Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) a wealthy Miami drug lord whom Tony ends up working for. Frank Lopez's right hand man is Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham) a guy who does not like Tony Montana's determination and attitude and calls him derogatory names like ""peasant"" and ""dish washer"" but Tony is not exactly crazy about him either. We also meet Tony's sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Manstrantonio) a beautiful 19-year old for whom Manolo falls for, but Tony does not want Manolo anywhere near his sister, because is the only pure untouched thing in his life and does not want her to be corrupted by his world, but eventually this does happen. Later on, Tony falls head over heels for Frank's sexy, young wife Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer) who despite her beauty and wealth, is always miserable and does nothing but snort coke all day and never cracks a single smile. Tony starts making the moves on Elvira, until later on in the movie, snatches her away from Frank, but not before removing Frank from the map, but that comes later. During one of Tony's business trips we meet yet another character, The ruthless and even more powerful drug kingpin, Alejandro Sosa (Paul Shenar) a Bolivian landowner who has a drug empire that stretches all across South America. Tony does his best, at first to impress this new acquaintance, and when Sosa questions him about his loyalty, Tony is quick to assure Sosa that he is also someone not to be messed with and is a man of his word. When Tony reaches the top and is now more powerful than his boss, Frank, ever was. Manolo, Tony's right hand man begins to take care of Tony's finances, but, in Tony's words, Manolo cares more about women than business and therefore, does not trust him completely when it comes to money.",

What have a I seen --- I thought --- a rock musical or what?",
437,11 May 2019,RossRivero99,10, One of the greatest gangster movies ever made,"Brian De Palma is arguably one of the greatest filmmakers of the last 50 years with classic films such as ""Carrie"" (1976) and ""The Untouchables"" (1987) to his name with this movie he has made his masterpiece and one of the finest movies about the mob ever put on film along with ""The Godfather"" (1972), ""The Godfather Part II"" (1974), and ""Goodfellas"" (1990), but unlike those movies it doesn't touch on the Italian mafia. Al Pacino stars in perhaps the finest and most manic performance as Tony Montana a Cuban exile who ends up in Miami and is desperate to find a way to make a living in America by any means necessary with his best friends Manny (Steven Bauer), Chi Chi (Angel Salazar), and Angel (Pepe Serna) in a refugee camp and as a result becomes a part of the mob. in order to make money and survive. Montana then meets a drug dealer named Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) who gave them green cards and a pardon for a murder they committed in Cuba. Then Montana becomes friends with another drug dealer named Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham), and falls in love with Frank's wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). This movie focuses so much more than Montana's life of drugs and crime it also focuses on his family relationships with his mother and his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) disgusted at the fact that he lives a life of crime, and is really a study on Montana's character but mostly doesn't portray him in the best way throughout the movie. The performances in the movie are rock solid with Pacino and Pfeiffer being the biggest standouts, and De Palma's direction is top notch with a very masterfully written screenplay by Oliver Stone. The movie is a remake of Howard Hawks' 1932 gangster film of the same name with Paul Muni in the lead role which I still have yet to see. This is a must see film for anyone that calls themselves a film buff and is a masterpiece of the crime genre.",
438,25 May 2005,objesguy,6," Pacino is great, but the rest of the film is overrated","Oliver Stone has a habit of writing extremely controversial films that are either extremely well done (e.g. JFK) or extremely corny (e.g. Natural Born Killers). Scarface is one of those corny ones unfortunately, even though it seems hard to believe that this film could be mediocre considering it has one of the greatest directors ever at the helm (Brian De Palma), and one of the greatest actors of our generation gracing the main role (Al Pacino). Unfortunately, while Pacino's performance is one of the best (and maybe his most overacted)of his career, the film itself is filled with mediocre performances, a cheesy and linear storyline, and bland, one-dimensional characters that prevent this crime movie from being anything more than a popcorn action flick.",

443,3 May 2021,TheHonestCritic,10, This is a another one of those rare remakes that's better than the original film. How does it hold up today?,"""Scarface"" (1983), the original movie from 1932 really helped pave the way for crime and gangster films we know today. As much as I enjoy the original movie, the remake is superior and elevates the concept of the story to the next level. Also, it happens to be one of my top ten all-time favorite crime/gangster films! It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is similar to the original film with a few minor changes. In this film, our main character is named Tony Montana, instead of Tony Camonte. The story takes place in Miami instead of Chicago. Also, the plot in this film is heavily focused on drugs. All of those aspects add a stronger layer to the story and add more complexities to the plot itself. I remember when I first saw this movie, I didn't know how long it was. Once it begun, I was fully invested from beginning to end. Then, I looked at the clock and noticed that nearly three hours had gone by! I thought to myself: ""that was three hours? Wow, it didn't even feel like two!"" That's the sign of brilliant storytelling. When a long film goes by fast, then you know it's a winner! Plus, it has one of my top ten favorite lines in all of cinema, which is: ""say hello to my little friend!"" It's so good, that you can still hear it being quoted today! People say it in real life, plus, characters in movies and TV shows have said it on numerous occasions. I don't know if that was the script writer's intention, but he has written a brilliant line. Props to you, Oliver Stone! I don't want to go into any more details about the story, because I don't want to spoil anything. But, let me assure you, it's one that you'll never forget as long as you live. As far as the acting goes, it's equally as phenomenal as the storyline itself. But, of course the shining star in this movie has got to be Al Pacino as Tony Montana. With any movie he stars in, Al Pacino never disappoints, no matter how prominent his characters are. But, his performance here, in my opinion, is one of his absolute best! Another thing I like about his portrayal is that he is not cowardly like Tony Camonte in the original film. Now, hear me out, Tony Camonte was not a coward throughout the whole movie. His fear came out near the end. However, Tony Montana showed no fear and stayed strong all the way to the end and went out like a real man that never ever backed down. That just makes him a better and stronger character than the one in the original movie. Another thing, he really nails the Cuban accent. Usually, I don't like it when an actor or actress plays a character with a different accent from their real-life one. When that happens, their attempt at the accent is either too over the top, not believable enough or they don't even try. If I were a casting agent, I would try and find an actor or actress from that country with the accent that the character is supposed to have. Think about it, now this is an example, if the character in the film you're going to make is, let's say German. (I'm just making a point here). You wouldn't hire an actor that isn't German. If you cast actors or actresses who are actually from whatever country, then their accents would be authentic. Unless your actor can nail whatever accent they're doing, you should cast someone of that nationality. However, in the case of this movie, Al Pacino does an excellent job with the Cuban accent. If you didn't know that he was Italian-American, then you would honestly believe he was from Cuba! Give the dialect coach and Al Pacino an award! As for the rest of the cast, they're just as outstanding with their acting performances. The chemistry between the whole cast is impeccable and definitely shines on the screen. All of the sets/locations are stunning and give the film a beautiful atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, they are all well-done and still hold up today. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Giorgio Moroder is perfect and it really helps bring the movie to life! The film score sets the tone immediately and elevates the emotion of the story even further. Some people might say it's cheesy and overblown, but, for a plot like this, a soundtrack like that is warranted and it helps to tie everything together. ""Scarface"" is a triumph in the field of crime/gangster movies. Like I mentioned before, it's one of those rare remakes that's even better than the original. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Scarface"" yet, go and see it today. Or else, Tony Montana might hunt you down!",

Her review of Scarface, the DePalma version and not the 1931 original, are surprisingly, to me anyway. Negative. She seems to think that Murray Abraham is the best thing in the movie and that the best that can be said for Pacino, is summed up in her reference to the overhead shot of him laying in the huge circular tub, a cigarette butt in a huge ashtray"". She was referring to his lassitude and immobility, that the camera has to move since he doesn't.

450,24 August 2006,spartakus49,6, Over rated,"Caution Spoiler. I have found that gangster movies, violent movies, or movies with criminal or non law abiding characters are generally over rated. Goodfellas and The Godfather are wicked movies even with the traits I had stated previously. I had heard from a fare amount of people that Scarface is one of the best movies ever made. Now that I have seen Scarface I can say I was a little disappointed. I am aware of Pacino's brilliance but I was not that impressed at the over tanned white Cuban. Al Pacino was awesome as Tony Montana and Pacino is responsible for a good number of the star's in Scarface's overall rating. His mother hates him, he kills his sister, he kills his brother and he also gets killed. Id rather be partially mentally or physically handicapped then end up like Tony Montana. Cocaine is a cancer on this world and is one of the worst narcotics. Cocaine even for a non addict or anybody for that matter makes your penis shrink, makes you impotent, causes some pretty bad paranoia, makes your heart beat out of control, I see no need to elaborate but have just scratched the surface of the negative attributes of cocaine. Cocaine is not a drug, the high you get from cocaine is not even close to being enjoyable and I am considering it a tax on the stupid.",

It's easy to wish for him to succeed.. Soundtrack has kind of become part of the pop culture!",
454,27 October 2019,harryplinkett14,8," Fun, but flawed","The subplot with the anti-hero's family was shoehorned into this film to give it more 'depth', probably so critics wouldn't butcher it as nothing but an excuse to show violent scenes. But we didn't need that subplot to like Tony or to enjoy his journey to success and ultimate demise. I just hate it.
Also, the scene where they attempt to assassinate him makes no sense. The assassination attempt is so amateurish, and on top of that, the man who ordered it watches sports rather than waiting to hear what happened. He also forgets to put any guards on duty, so Tony can just walk in. Killing Tony, who always walks alone, often drunk and drugged up, would seem like a fairly easy thing.
And then no one ever seems to investigate that assassination attempt or the fact he had two guys, one of them an important police officer, killed. In this film, the police never seems to investigate any murders, at least not when it's convenient for the plot.
Then we have this narco-boss from South America, who for some reason needs Tony's help to kill a guy who has no protection whatsoever. As we learn, every important person in the country is being threatened by this guy, and for some reason, not only have they not had him killed a long time ago, but they need Tony to drive a car so they can kill him. These are the same guys who sent a team of what appears to be 100 guys to kill Tony, within hours. Why would they need Tony to be the driver?
Finally, the romance between Tony and his wife is non-existent, and I don't now whether it was meant to be non-existent, or the script fails to make us believe these people ever had true feelings for one another.",
455,20 December 2022,xiaoli7377,9, Frustrating,"Al Pacino's Tony Montana is one of the best and most quotable movie characters of all time, by far the highlight of this movie. The screenplay (at least in terms of character dialogue) by Oliver Stone is also excellent. The finale is iconic. That's what makes my appraisal of ""Scarface"" very frustrating, because there are so many great things to love about this movie. So many great individual scenes. But there's something about it that feels a little hollow, like a sense of cohesion that's missing. We're taken all over the place in the plot, some of the tone shifts from funny to sad to psychotic rage in the span of something like five minutes. Most of the other characters aside from Tony feel severely underdeveloped. Like much more dialogue was needed between them in a familial way. It's not even necessarily a runtime thing because this movie is almost three hours already.",

Montana rises to the top of Florida's crime chain, appropriating Loggia's coke-head mistress (Michelle Pfeiffer) in the process. Howard Hawks' ""X Marks the Spot"" motif in depicting the story line's many murders is dispensed with in the 1983 Scarface; instead, we are inundated with blood by the bucketful, especially in the now-infamous buzz saw scene. One carry- over from the original Scarface is Tony Montana's incestuous yearnings for his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). The screenplay for the 1983 Scarface was written by Oliver Stone",

458,16 August 2020,lleuadserenmor,9, Still reeling,"It'll take some time to recover from being privileged enough to have accompanied Al Pacino through his fabled journey here...from his ill fated decision to give up his humble existence scratching out a living washing up, to rising to the dubious heights of Miami's darkest side through the 1980's drug fuelled excesses. This astonishing , visually gory, rollercoaster of a film challenges the idea of wealth and machismo to an extreme level, pushing Pacino's apparently endless, limitless and glorious acting abilities from one experience to another, as we witness with excruciating accuracy the demise of misplaced and ruthlessly executed ambition, whilst being under the all consuming influence of a steadily rising and utterly reckless drug addiction. Pacino's sunny and kind of innocent good looks and natural determination slowly diminish as the Miami sheen and tropical beaches corrupt and corrode his cheery survivalist instinct s as the whole film exposes with some savagery the underworld which Pacino's character Tony is initially tempted into, only superficially rules for a short time, before becoming it's slave again. The brilliance lies within Pacino's demonic performance, at times sublime, conveying brutally raw speeches to himself, his doomed confidants, to anyone, actually, who is caught in his mesmerising web of limitless ambition and apparently achievable aims. Even when he's in one of the most anguishing scenes, unable to stand, furious at his once awe inspiring wife, in a restaurant, he publically humiliates himself, his wife, his life, at the realisation that it's all gone to hell,. yet he still manages to jump back just in time for the last scenes, which are as inevitable as they are appalling, with Tony struggling to get his head out of a pile of cocaine whilst surrounded by the shot out remains of his decadent villa, black marble and gold pillars crumbling around blood stained bodies and carpets. He is defiant and scathing and full of bravado right til the end. The parts of the film that are the most telling are also the most moving, the return to his family, who know who he really is, his expensive suit offending his astute and frightened mother, who despises his lifestyle as much as his inability to be honest, from the almost funny refusal by the banks to refuse the funds Tony ends up supplying them with. The lack of technology here also, becomes one of the films best features, with no props needed for Pacino to shine. This hangs on machismo instincts working overtime, direct, brutal communication from one trusted man to another , with dark politics overhanging every conversation, deal and murder that occurs. Loyalty is everything for these men...the women here are symbolic, the mother, who loves her son but knows exactly where he's going to end up and almost can't bear to look, the wife, who becomes the passed on possession from one crook to a better crook, almost without her own voice as she follows the addicts route of almost total dependence into any hell scene , and the more challenging depiction of the sister, where we catch unnerving glimpses of almost Shakespearean , Hamlet style, tortuous , obsessive, possessive relationships, twisted from the biblical ideal and warped by addiction into something entirely on the other end of the spectrum. It's a cliche to say that this is a drugs gangsta film, but that's what it is, ultimately, but it's just that this one is probably one of the best for sheer clout. It's got it all...it's a showstopper. Just one of Pacino's jaw dropping scenes is full, packed to the hilt with every conceivable emotion, and much of this is from those eyes alone. Antihero he might well be, and much of this classic is hard to watch, but forgettable it certainly isn't. Tony's demise , his desire to succeed, and the outer ripples of corruption stemming from his inner circle of paranoid existence makes for a compelling, rightly iconic and legendary movie creation.",

463,9 May 2020,Coffee_in_the_Clink,9, Gangster's Damnation,"Al Pacino absolutely steals the show in this high-charged and gratuitous crime film, written by Oliver Stone a few years before his masterpiece ""Platoon"", and directed by Brian de Palma. I find it fascinating how the film manages to be a glamourous depiction of a gangster's rise to power and riches and also an extremely anti-gangster movie, showing his disillusionment when at the top wondering if this is really the life he had in mind while chasing his twisted version of the American Dream - epitomised in one scene by the subliminal messaging on a blimp flying overhead, ""The World Is Yours"". Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is a Cuban refugee who arrives in Miami and ends up in a camp under a freeway, before carrying out a hit for a mobster and getting his green-card. After some wheeling and dealing and a couple of jobs, along with his best friend Manny (Steven Bauer), Montana, ruthless and extremely street-smart, sees his opportunity to take-over the cocaine drug in Miami and wipes out any and all opposition. He becomes the top-dog, but inevitably, and thanks to his erratic temper and personality, it won't be long before someone tries to take him down. Al Pacino is brilliant to watch here. Some think his performance is over-the-top but I personally think it's superb and think he was completely in charge of it. Stone's screenplay, like his screenplay for ""Platoon"" would later be, is harsh, full of sharp, natural and uncompromising dialogue. De Palma took this and chose to make it a glamourous depiction of the gangster's lifestyle, with bright-lightning, the uncanny background painting in the office of the palm trees and sunsets - a perfect allegory, really, for the life Montana is striving for - accompanied by a superb, pulsating score. It's interesting that he done it this way, because Stone's script was neutral in that a director could have made it very grim and with an unrelenting dark atmosphere all through if they'd seen fit. That's how versatile Stone's writing is here. De Palma does a wonderful job because the film, and Montana, goes out with a serious bang. The ending is as flashy, gratuitous and relentless as Pacino's galvanising performance.",
464,10 January 2016,manuelro,9, A good rendition of what's to come,Interesting movie but the essence of it was much exaggerated to almost a caricaturised degree. The action is solid but the characters are very weak and light minded. Hope to see a remake that will more accurately portray the underlying spirit of the archetypes from which the movie was inspired. It's good to see good chemistry between the characters of the movie but I believe that was only added for artistic reasons. There are a lot of things I would add to this review but I think keeping it brief increases its reach. Overall I am feeling hopeful for a continuation of the series with different reworked characters with a better ending. Happy new era everyone.,

481,26 April 2020,jayjaycee,10, The rise and fall of an antihero,"""Scarface"" is a 1983 crime drama directed by Brian De Palma starring Al Pacino and Steven Bauer. As many others probably did, I celebrated the legend's birthday as well by watching one of the most popular and mainstream gangster flicks of all time, a film I've been kicking down the road for way too long. Admittedly, this turns out to be a massive mistake, as this film is nearly perfect by all means. The main factor of this films success is without a doubt Pacino's versatile and above all menacing performance as rising gangster Tony Montana. He's definitely is absolutely credible in portraying a Cuban compatriot. From an authentic Cuban accent to his overall demeanour he was excellent, but what surprised me the most is how one of the most popular gangster film protagonists is undeniably one of the greatest antiheroes in cinematic history at the same time. Screenwriter Oliver Stone created an iconic main character with such a diverse personality that you really can sympathize with in a strange manner. Over the course of the film, Montana lives the classic American dream and literally goes from rags to riches. With a runtime of almost three hours one could mean that it has its lengths and might become boring after a while, but the screenplay never gives you the opportunity to lose track. There's always something more happening, and the suspense curve starts on a medium level and goes up continuously from there on. Never does it take a hit once and it's almost masterful to see something like that happen in such a long movie. Generally, the longer the movie, the higher is the probability that the film loses the interest of its audience at some parts (like some Scorsese flicks, for instance), hence I think it's nothing short of incredible that this film manages to perfectly avoid this common effect. If you need to look up a film with a perfectly paced plot development, this film is the showpiece example for this question. As I already stated before, all this wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for the force of nature of a person that Tony Montana is. The titular scar faced maniac is something I'd show a class when it comes to characterizing an antihero, because he's an extraordinarily conceptualised and multidimensional fictional character the film would be nothing without. In the beginning, he's a nobody, a political refugee who works as a dishwasher who tries to aim for the stars without any realistic plan, but he's ambitious and on top of that, determined and fearless. His intrepidity eventually pays off and gradually becomes more successful and doesn't seem to be willing to stop. What makes this character development so outstanding though, is the way he reaches his goal and how he secures his position. His insatiable hunger for power makes him totally unpredictable. The more power he gains, the more he disassociates himself from the values he used to believe in, and he more and more becomes a monster. This inexorably increasing greed simultaneously increases his mistrust and severe paranoia towards everyone and everything. While he still had a sense of rudimentary loyalty in the beginning, he's become more merciless from minute to minute. He would sell his own grandmother if she was a threat for is power status and it's evidenced by how he betrays every former associate and partner, even his mentor in the process and how he underestimates even the ones who are obviously more powerful than him. Pride comes before the fall and you can clearly tell that his judgement is successively tainted. The most fascinating thing is how it seems to never be enough to him, as many scenes show how he is palpably bored by his carefree life. Seriously, he seems to have everything he's desired, the wife, the wealth and the power, yet he is unsatisfied with it and desires more. For instance, the scene where he sits in his own office, drunk and hooked on an immense amount of cocaine and the way he still looks like the most bored human being on earth is one of the many scenes that made me smile for just how brilliant it was. Even though he went sky high and should be happy with the way he is, he still craves for a higher place that exists from his point of view. Furthermore, he depraves everyone around him, allies and foes alike and destroys all of their lives with his reckless behaviour. In the end, he can't tell the difference between friend or enemy. Do you know those moments in a film that conclusively consolidate your suspicion of watching a cinematic masterpiece? Well, in this film it happened again. With several scenes that impressed me there's this one scene rather in the end where Tony shoots Manny after finding out he had a sexual encounter with his sister, only to find out that they got married a day before. Pacino's reaction after realising that he made a severe mistake, his heart breaking in the matter of seconds, the way the hate immediately leaves his face and makes way for regret was this one breathtaking scene. That's how I also come to another thing that fascinated me deeply, a single character trait that actually contradicts his general personality: Family. Even though it's depicted that he would do anything to keep his position of power, there's this strange sense for family that makes him vulnerable. Next to the way he cares about his sister Gina, there is this one specific scene where he prevents the innocent wife and children of a target person from being killed, aware of the fact that this will lead to his own death. The ruthless gangster boss gives up everything he has achieved for ... family? This is exactly what makes this character even more fascinating and saves the last bit of humanity in him. Nonetheless, he receives his legitimate punishment for his extreme cockiness, in a scene that's iconic as it is powerfully symbolic. Montana who indirectly declared himself a god-king is ultimately reminded by his own mortality and all the mistakes he's made that lead to his inevitable fall, his death being the only logical consequence and price to pay for his acts. All in all, this gangster drama is a masterful character study about a man and the way he parishes by increasing power and the unquenchable thirst for money, the way he treated all the people on the way and how he eventually faces the consequences. Pacino delivered an outstanding performance and almost singlehandedly made this film a huge success, as he made the antihero of this compelling crime drama come to life effortlessly. Sophisticated, extremely entertaining and with sheer brilliance in acting and writing, this film absolutely impressed me and it feels like it will have a bigger impact on me than I expected. Shame on me that I have not watched it earlier and the fact that I only own it on DVD. The next time I see it on sale, I will upgrade it without thinking too much. That is what I owe this masterpiece.",

I just feel that the self-expression in the film is a bit awkward. It may be related to the role, but not to the acting skills. The Cuban gangster is not the Italian gangster. I think another gangster actor is very natural and unintentional. By the way, when Al Pacino killed the boss, the last younger brother asked if he needed work. The actor's performance, the expression was really too good, and one thought that he was going to die, and then not only died but also got a job, that kind of sad feeling made people funny and sympathetic",

It is evenly spread out, and that's what makes the movie perfect.

Scarface is good but still you find many other organized crime movies that are better. I must hand praise to Brian De Palma who did a terrific job with this work, plus this ranks as one of the better performances from Al Pacino. Pacino is nearly great as Cuban refugee Tony Montana who emigrates to Miami, Florida to make a fortune in the underworld of organized crime as he goes to the top of his game with a vengeance. I must say this about Scarface if you enjoy much cursing and the blood and guts violence then this is a film for you. I remember the chain saw scene in the motel now that was gore! Yet this is organized crime in Miami, Florida during the 80's so the film was certainly correct with it's demonstration of violence. The performance by Steven Bauer is also worth a notice.

511,2 September 2008,mr_popcorn,9," McCheesy's take on ""Scarface""","Tony: Look at dem pelicangs fly! An update of the 1932 film, Scarface (1983) follows gangster Tony Montana and his close friend Manny Ray from their trip on the Cuban Boat Lift for refugees to their arrival in Miami. After killing a powerful Cuban figure, Montana and company gain the ability to leave their refugee camps and roam around the U.S. After unsuccessfully trying to make it legitimately in the country, Montana and Ray resort to selling cocaine to dealers around the world. Tony's rise is quick, but as he becomes more powerful, his enemies and his own paranoia begin to plague his empire Before I go on with my review, let me just say that Al Pacino is one scary dude. I wouldn't be messing around with him because as he aptly said, ""You mess with me! You mess with the best!"". I mean, even to the last minutes of his colorful drug-induced life, he stood there and took the bullets like it was nothing. It was really looking to be the best, most badass way to die that is until some Terminator wannabe hack creeped behind him and loaded Tony with a 12 gauge shotgun. That scene along with the forever classic ""Say hello to my LITTLE FRIEND!"" was one of the most violent, visually amazing, bullet orgy I have ever seen in the history of cinema.",
512,24 November 2022,sudhakaranakhilan,8, Pacino at his best,"I can't see Al Pacino here in Scarface because Tony Montana steals the show entirely. I think each and every frame of the movie is assigned to Tony and that assignment didn't go wrong. Scarface is a cult - classic, which is actually an action-oriented, violent flick but seems so different from its predecessor, which was released ten years before, The Godfather. Obviously, these two films are two in their content and execution but one thing common in both films is the presence of the star, Al Pacino. Micheal Corleone and Tony Montana are two different characters with different visions and approaches. Micheal is so intellectual, calm, and soft-spoken (mostly) but Tony is arrogant, uneducated, and has his balls and words at the most which he doesn't break at all. Scarface also points out the Cuban migration to the US which was a strong political movement that happened at that time. Tony is a Cuban citizen, he came here to the US as a migrant then worked as a drug dealer and turned into a big bully in the drug market. In specific, the rise and fall of Tony Montana is the base element of the movie. We can see lots of shades in the character of Tony aside from the points we mentioned earlier. He doesn't know how to be romantic and that's why he can't receive Elvira's love. But he is so much fond of his family, especially his sister, Gina. It's very difficult to understand his affection towards Gina because it has so many layers to it. It can be a normal brother-sister relationship, or some sort of revenge on his mom (because she rejects Tony's money at some part of the movie and she says she doesn't need him), or it might be an incestuous kind of thing. Anyway, at the end portion, Gina promulgates the point of the incestuous attitude of Tony but Tony seems strange in her attitude. So it is quite confusing. Tony is also very much fond of kids and says this to Elvira many times. That fondness was the reason for him to spare the government official from being blasted by his Bolivian counterpart, Soso. We can find out many divisions of Tony's characteristics which is also a detailed topic to discuss. Through Tony, Al Pacino conquers Scarface.",

There are plenty of reasons to hate this movie: the glorification of violence; the unbelievably misogynistic treatment of women; Al Pacino's patently unconvincing Cuban accent; Giorgio Moroder's music (actually, the pulse-pounding score itself is great, but those early-80s power ballads are worth a few giggles); the stereotyping of Cubans and Colombians. But the violence in this movie really is undeniably beautiful; the women aren't treated any worse than in any other gangster film; Pacino is inspired, clumsy accent notwithstanding, and it's glorious to see him really let it all out (in a performance that I believe he calls his favorite); Moroder's music adds to the outrageousness of the proceedings; and the stereotyping, well... bad on De Palma, but what can I say? This is one terrific story, and it's certainly told well.",
514,1 December 2003,lotus_chief,9, Arguably Al Pacino's best performance....,"Scarface was seen as nothing but a violent, offensive, garbage movie to critics when it was originally released.  It's still probably seen that way today.  But I would imagine, to their disappointment, it has and continues to stand the test of time.  Scarface will never be on a Top 100 list, but it is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  The realism of Scarface, I could only guess, scared a lot of people away.  This realism, along with its no holds barred, uncensored nature, makes this film great in my eyes. Now, many people use this to write off Scarface as an irresponsible, misguided movie with a tasteless overabundance of blood, drugs, killing and cursing.  Those who can appreciate the grittiness of Scarface are who talk highly of it.  ",

I saw it with my husband when it first hit the movie theaters and it was all we could do to sit through the senseless violence and disgusting language. I love action movies (I have everything that Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Lee, Norris, etc., has made so far), that is why we went to see this movie in the first place. But this movie has no redeeming qualities. It is mind-numbing. It has a high rating, why I really cannot fathom, unless it appeals to the testosterone levels of inadequate boys. I suggest the original Scarface if you want to see a better movie. To Mr. Pacino: Please don't waste your excellent talents on such garbage again.",
516,8 March 2003,Meltdown53098533,10, A different yet so remarkable piece of film making.,"This movie has been pounded by bad reviews simply because it gave a new outlook on the criminal life. The performance by Al Pachino was a unique one in all the ways I see him. He swears, he kills, he does coke, so naturally we're suppose to hate him because he's obviously an anti hero. Yet if you have seen most of the really good mafia movies (Goodfellas, Casino, Reservoir Dogs ect.) you will find yourself routing for Pachino. He plays Tony Montona, a Cuban refugee who comes to America in hopes of one day to be the top of the cocaine empire. He finds his best friend Manny and together they go on a rocky road of violence, death, drugs and bullet shells. Of course this movie is DEFINATELY not for the squeamish because not only is there a sickening amount of language, but there was gore galore as well. Scarface was so violent, that when it came time to put it on video the film board ordered a scene to be almost cut entirely from the feature. It is rumored that the whole bloody scene will be put on the collector's edition DVD and I'm eager to buy that as soon as I see it. Yes Scarface is a different performance from Al Pachino, but if the right people see the movie, they will be left stunned. The violence, the drama, the surprisingly good and driving music. Watch this movie and see the story of two Cuban refugees who hit it big, and (much like the overall price of glory) ultimatly witness all their dreams implod on them. Scarface is a surprising movie, but when watched by the right people it is a masterpiece. 9.1/10",

This is the most realistic ,visious, straight to the point well constructed movie with some off the best lines ever told,the true mind of a gangster, when he looses his temper, when he has to stay solid as a rock,were he will not be afraid of no man and will challenge any opponent that tries to outsmart him or be stronger than him. this movie makes you wake up and be strong and face your toughest moments.the attitude al pacino has is of a guy who will not let you stumble on his foot twice,knows that he can get what he wants,and and grabs every opportunity, what did you expect? where was the acting not good? if you did not like al pacinos performance then you don't know what a gangster movie is all about.Respect,money and a woman to make you complete.even when scarface had a mission to eliminate a person while driving a car and there where kids involved he went with his heart and terminated the whole thing, he didn't care about the consequences that he will have to fight against a strong mafia member,he just went with his instinct although he was a tough guy, he had some good inside off him and didn't let anyone higher than him change his way of thinking, and that is what its all about, thats why he says all that I've got is in this world is my word and my b...s and i don't break them for no one. and he fought till the end. that is what gangster is all about, unfortunately he died. but with Honor, Honor that no other man stepped on him and made him look like a p...y. If you didn like the movie because it was violent or over the top then just watch some stupid dramatic feel good movie that ends with a happily ever after bull...t finish, but if you know what it takes to be in these guys shoes and want a good gangster flick that starts from rags to riches, the real deal then this is for you.

The two main problems for me are, first the swearing. There is just way too many f***'s to really enjoy the dilaouge. Second, the last twenty minutes, is just like a John Woo action film, which took away from the story. Even though this film runs at 2 hours 50 minutes, I definitely didn't feel it at all.

The violence is graphic, the language unbearable, but the characters are predictable. There are a few terrific performances aside from Pacino...a 'pre-Amadeus' F. Murray Abraham delivers well as the ill-fated Omar Suarez, Miriam Colon steals the scene from Pacino as the Mama filled with pride, and angry as she sees her son's descent into the nether-world of drugs and crime. It's what I wish Beryl Mercer would have said and done with Cagney in The ""Public Enemy"". This film is a difficult watch because it travels forth in almost real-time, and if you miss a little...you miss a lot. It is not for kids. Also, while the film was dedicated to Hawks and Hecht, I don't think the contribution of Seton I. Miller to the original screen-play should be overlooked.

A modern-day morality tale based on real issues from the overlapping 1980s crises. In many ways it picks up on a storyline that the Godfather Trilogy was poking at repeatedly. An interesting appearance by Michelle Pfeiffer, who is normally the OCD/peppy/creative lead in the movies in which she plays a more prominent role. It's interesting to see where Pacino's character (Tony) feels he should draw the line in terms of moral behavior.

There are a couple people I have in mind, one of them is Johnny Depp who is arguably one of the greatest this business has ever seen..and if you have seen Donnie Brasco then you know it can be done by him. The other one would be Edward Norton, he is another one of the greats and can do anything. Those are the only two I think are capable.",

The costumes, the music score and soundtrack, the hairstyles, make no mistake about it this is a film all about crime in the 80's and while it should have dated horribly it hasn't. This is still a superb film. While Georgio Moroder's music has dated a fair bit, it still compliments the story of Tony Montana well thanks to the superb screenplay by Oliver Stone and the first class direction of Brian De Palma, one of two films that he has made with Pacino (the other being the fantastic Carlito's Way).

559,23 March 2006,writerasfilmcritic,7, A Good Movie But Not a Great One,"""Scarface"" is a good movie, but not a great one. There are a number of good scenes and good performances, but some definite flaws. It is certainly an entertaining effort, especially early on, starting with the interview of the surly Cuban immigrant, Tony Montana (Al Pacino) by skeptical US officials. Soon thereafter comes the horrific chainsaw execution of his partner at a Miami drug deal gone about as bad as one can go. Here, we witness the first lapse in judgment by Montana's close friend, Manny (Steven Bauer), who flirts with a blonde in a bikini instead of providing immediate backup as one of his friends is brutally killed and the other (Tony) is just about to face the same fate. We are then introduced to small time coke dealer Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and his beautiful girlfriend, Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). Tony is bowled over by her charms and decides almost immediately that he must possess this woman, no matter what the risk. However, the supposed sexual chemistry that should be evident between them is unconvincing. His motivation comes off more like some sort of business deal or arrangement than anything else. He thinks Elvira is ""a tiger"" and wants her to be the mother of his children, yet he doesn't seem to have any great physical desire for her. This is definitely a serious flaw, because it is Frank's fear of Tony and his jealousy over Elvira that drives him to order a hit on Montana. But Tony survives and gets even in one of the more effective scenes in the movie. From that point on, although little seems to be stopping him, nothing goes quite right for Tony again. Excess clouds his thinking at almost every turn and leads to his eventual downfall. For example, his relationship with Elvira starts to deteriorate soon after they are married. She is always stoned, can't give him any children, and apparently is disinterested in sex. Seeming both drunk and sloppy with dope, he insults her publicly and she stalks out of the fancy restaurant and his life. The incident is followed by one of the film's better moments, Tony's ""I'm a bad man"" soliloquy in front of all ""the rich mummies"" who were attempting to enjoy their meal.",

Al Pacino's great performance made me sympathise, as well as hate his character. He was psychotic but also pitiful. I loved the speech he made about how everyone demonises his own behaviour so they can feel better about themselves. This moral stance rung true for me. Although, this film isn't perfect. I don't think that it flowed as well it could have done and the pacing was uneven.

However, it doesn't live up to the ""Greatest Film in Cinema History"" title that the hip-hop community has bestowed upon it. There are some scenes that look positively cartoonish when compared to some of Scorsese's gangster epics. The cinematography, set design, costumes, and music are all lively and colorful, but sometimes make the whole story seem trapped in cheesy 80s excess. Ten years later, Pacino and DePalma reunited for ""Carlito's Way"", and that film was, in my opinion, even better than ""Scarface."" Sophisticated and genuinely emotional, and not a bit over-rated.",

And backed up by some of the most shocking and memorable scenes ever committed to the big screen. It's a long one but still holds tough all the way through. It uses cheesy soundtracks to great effect, and backs up the carnage with glimpses of sentimentality, such as when Pacino (who plays the hard gangster Tony 'scarface' Montana) goes to see his family, and when he makes a stand in not blowing up the target car, because a woman and some children are inside, Sure he does actually resort to shooting his 'compadre' in the face, but it is admirable and a rather weak side that shows when he decides not to let the woman and her kids die. The fact this film manages to alternate between hardcore gore fests and compassionate scenes such as these means that there is more depth to the film, this depth is what holds a viewer in their seat. If it was just a three hour shoot 'em up, or just some three hour long romance epic it would really ruin it.

I saw this movie when it debuted in 1983.  At that time, the Academy Awards (whom I have very little respect for) snubbed this film.  The feeling then by a lot of people was that it was not a ""politically correct film"".  It denounced and very loudly, everything it could about the government and how drugs were being brought into this country as well.  Another stone cast was about the fact that there was too much violence.  Well, there was a lot more violence being reported on the news in magazines at the time (Look, Life, etc.) than there could have ever been in a fictionalized account of a person who rose to the top with dirty money.  How many people have done this in politics?  Anyhoo, the snubbing by the Academy was aimed mostly at Oliver Stone for writing this story and Brian De Palma for directing it.  By the way, same people who voted this one out did the same thing with the Color Purple and to Steven Spielberg.  Yet another movie that moviegoes loved, but the Academy snubbed. ",

Depending on how you at this character and his achievements he is either a great man who worked hard to become the Kingpin of crime or an unfortunate cook who has a lot of reasons to hate Castro. What is indisputable though is that the viewer finds themselves caught up in his world and rooting for him against the obviously more deranged Cartels who are even worse than him.

In the movie we see an ordinary, very ambitious man, who knows exactly what he wants and most importantly - what he has to do to earn it. And he is doing it. We are watching how this man is climbing the ladder in the hierarchy of the crime world step by step all the way to the top, achieving all he has ever wanted in this world - money, power, respect, a dream woman. Then at the end we see how these things just are impossible to have in this kind of sphere of living - and at the very end he loses all in a big collapse. He literally loses all, including his own life, but he dies when everything else is gone before that, so he got nothing to lose except his life. The difference ""Scarface"" makes in this kind of movies is that we see some brilliant movie-making, directing and especially acting, most in the face of the great actor Al Pacino. He turns the image of Tony Montana into a masterpiece of acting skill. Thanks to that, when we watch ""Scarface"", we are seeing more than just a 0-100 crime/drug lord rising.",

I understand that some aspects of Scarface must have been somewhat groundbreaking at the time, but I still suspect that much of its success is due to the hyping of its violence.  The acting is so-so, and Pacino is miscast as an unsophisticated thug and refugee.  The only redeeming value of this movie is its classic, kitshy disco soundtrack.

The best that has been done to allay such disincentives to the desire to conquer has been addressed to quite an extent in The Godfather 2 where the seemingly good judgement of the conqueror stretches his conquest to many years of depression instead of a precipitous crash into oblivion as is glorified in this one. Differences apart, this movie scores over the other in driving home that dreaded message not by drawing on the underprivileged upbringing of the chief protagonist but by glorifying the high that comes not from trumping your enemies but by trumping the ones you trumped your enemies with for what seems like plain old sibling rivalry in the higher echelons of the mafia translates into pretty much the same thing with more unacceptable connotations in the story of the rise of blood brothers finding family in the other's shortcomings. The lesson then is not in the inevitability of an informally contrived law, psychobabble at best, but in the primal motivation to see a conquest as an individual achievement, to be sustained and honed by the barely legible hierarchies forged in battle. Fluid hierarchies aren't demands of Organizational Behavior; instead, they are just frameworks that keep the economics of a setup from being dissected into pieces by rivals, ever aware of its genesis, and its foundations, to have accommodated it in their game of thrones.",

602,1 January 2016,majhiggins,8, Almost a true classic,"Filled with a truly iconic main character, highly memorable and believable supporting cast and a gripping and gritty story line, this movie is 80% the reverse hero masterpiece of the original 2 Godfather movies. Unfortunately, that is a bit like claiming to be 80% virgin. The problem here seems to be Brian DePalma similar affliction. He is a pretty good director but he thinks he's a truly great director. This is kind of a short range period piece, made in the early 1980s about a story starting in the late 1970s and that's part of the problem. It feels like a film made in the early 80s! Imagine you could find a person who simultaneously knew western cinema but somehow had no idea who Marlon Brando, Diane Keyton, Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Talia Schire or James Caan were and they had never seen the Godfather movies. You show them one and two and then ask ""When were these movies made?"". They couldn't tell you. They are set in a period spanning the 1920s through the 1960s and the cars, costumes and sets show that perfectly but the movies themselves could have been made last year. DePalma unfortunately chose to go with an electronic music sound track and that screws the feel of the piece. Of course, the music from a late 70s disco is going to be laden with that cheesy synthesizer sound and they did mix a few classic non-synth songs into background music. That's totally appropriate but using second generation synthesizers of 1981 to record dramatic background themes for the movie was a terrible call. Godfather's original soundtrack uses instruments and modalities that are timeless and provide no insight into when the work was made. That's why I would love to see this flick respectfully remade into the classic it by all means should have been.",
603,3 September 2008,yilmazk,10, FAB with a Bad Attitude,"Tony Montana is a FAB with a bad attitude and big enough cojones to make yours drop dead. All his life he has been looking for an opportunity which he finds on the streets of Miami. To him only time stands between him and the world and soon he goes right through the top. Money, Power, Respect, he gets it all only to learn that the hard part is not getting to the top but staying there. Pacino really gives everything he's got in this one and makes the part so his own that one can't help but wonder whether this movie would have been this good if it was someone else playing this role. Rest of the cast do their job really well also, especially Steve Bauer as loyal friend and partner Manny Ribera. The score is just as gangster as the story and there is uncountable amount of classic lines which i already mentioned a few here and there. Between the lines however this is a story about so many things besides selling drugs and killing people. What i love about this film is that it's message is whatever you make it out to be. On one side you can say it almost implies that you have to be ruthless and get what you want because no one's gonna give it to you. On the other side it shows so effectively how sooner or later the consequences of our careless actions catch up with us. It gives a brilliant multilayer message and lets you do the choosing. After all a message is only as good as it's receiver. This film will never get old. In a way it's a film about all of our lives because everyone can watch this film and relate to it whether you are rich or poor, young or old, i'm not sure i should say male or female. Anyway it's #1 in the genre mayn and it's a Masterpiece Chico!",

What this ends up being is a flimsy melodrama with nothing to say. Yes, Al Pacino delivers an incredible performance - but a great performance can't save a bad script. The only redeeming character in the piece is Tony's mother, but she barely has any screen time. The production values are high because it's a studio product. The relationships are never developed to any significant degree, and most of the lead characters simply fall in line with the life of crime and excess.

This film is set in Miami in 1980 and is 2 hours and 50 minutes long. Tony Montana is determined to run his own drug business. He is impatient and wants money and power and he is ready to do whatever it takes. But, it is a dangerous business? Will he manage to take over or will blow it all? I thought that Al Pacino's performance was the highlight of the film. Al Pacino plays the character of Tony Montana marvellously which makes this one of the most quotable movies ever. If you are one of those people who has not seen Scarface but as heard people quoting it all the time, as soon as you watch Scarface you will understand why people fell in love with the character of Tony Montana with his iconic 'scarface' look.

If you go for it all, you WILL lose, is the message here and rightfully so.

If you've enjoyed the Godfather and Braveheart and Gallipoli, which are the best movies that I've ever seen, along with Scarface, you have go to watch this movie.  Al Pacino gives a better performance than the one in the Godfather.

The culture ,like the chicks ,cars,drugs and money ,a business run by one man ,Tony Montana. On the other hand it portrays different relationships of Tony with his sister,Gina,Elvira,his love interest and his sidekick and best friend,Manny Riberra played by Steven Bauer. I really liked every performance especially AL pacino's. It was a great inspiration to GTA :Vice City (On of my favorite video games) as i played the game first ,now i know from where those all things came from. The twist ending in the mansion where everyone dies including Tony makes it more great and reminds us all the where the path of crime ends. Everyone did a good Job. Michelle Pfeiffer,she looks so pretty and the most likable dialogue of her in movie is ""Would you stop saying f***"" She portrays a drug addict perfectly Mary Elizabeth Mastranton,looks so cute in the beginning and turns to tramp as his brother Tony thinks,She is very good.

629,27 January 2000,Pinback-4,9, Gangster classic that was years ahead of its time.,"SCARFACE is one of the all-time great gangster films.  This is a movie that, like BLADE RUNNER, was considered garbage when first released, but now considered a cult classic.  It was easy to see why the critics hated it so much back then.  It contains excessively brutal violence, foul language, and a lot of drug use.  Everything in this movie is excessive, in fact, including the running time.  This is because Brian DePalma and Oliver Stone don't want to glorify drug kingpins like Tony Montana, played by Al Pacino in an all-out performance that should've gotten the Oscar.  There is good acting by others, especially Steven Bauer as Montana's partner.  He has the funniest scene in the movie in which he demonstrates his unique method of picking up girls.  A small but key performance is given by Paul Shenar as Sosa, Tony's Bolivian connection.  All of the male actors, in fact give believable performances:  Robert Loggia, Harris Yulin, F. Murray Abraham. It is the females who bring down the film a bit.  Michelle Pfeiffer, in her first significant role, seems too wooden.  Her most important last scene in the restaurant lacks conviction.  A little better is Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's little sister, but her character draws unintentional laughter because of her mushroom cloud hairstyle.  Their screen time is limited, though, and don't ruin the film.",

Many other films of this type I find distasteful and offensive but for reasons I can't explain this one I never tire of seeing.

Tip: if you want someone to not take you seriously and conclude you are a brain damaged ten year old boy, then by all means say badass. DePalma said many times he made this film to show the futility of violence and complete emptiness that type of will lead you to.

644,25 June 2005,AudemarsPiguet,10, Push it to the limit!Welcome to the limit!,"The first impression ever made about this film and its main character,even before I fully watched or understood it,was the immense lust for life,dignity and harsh masculine beauty(not necessarily in the outer sense of the word)Pacino invests in this character.This impression lingered with me obsessively long after the film was over and was boosted by further viewings. While it is redundant to repeat the story of Tony Montana,the main character of this film,it is very important to stress upon the fact that,without wanting to elude his vulnerability,he still is the product of his age and society. His story actually stats like a history lesson,beginning when the Cold War slowly drew to a close and Cuban refugees could enter the U.S.,Tony being one. For the petty criminal the new country truly is the promised land,but this was the general mood at the turn from the 1970's to the 1980's. The story starts during Jimmy Carter's reign,but much of Montana's rise as successful gangland baron takes place during the administration of a Ronald Reagan. Apparently unimportant trivia but it explains much of the context in which Montana rose to power-the Reagan era marks the shift from a Baptist,Christian,unspectacular president like Carter to a more ambitious one:Reagan the actor,the showman,the marketer(of his own public image).At the same time,with Reagan's direct support it marks a historical change from two decades of relentless social turmoil,crisis,shaken credibility to an age when the U.S. is regaining is status as world power,when a new hedonistic and egocentric generation of ""golden boys"",tired of the elder generation's nihilism and hippie rebellion,will turn a seemingly endless and incurable economic recession in an age of unprecedented prosperity when consumerism and cashing in legendarily climaxed. History records this period as ""reaganism"" and its motto was:""Greed...is good"",Montana illustrating this mentality as good as the broker acted by Michael Douglas in the film ""Wall Street"" which made these words famous. From rags to riches in record time at all cost-this is the way even crime became an economical wonder in the gilded 1980's. In a few years former penniless immigrant becomes head of a multimillion empire where money keeps on rolling in. The soundtrack,considered by many worse than that of a dated porn,is not only awesome,making the film worth watching almost only to hear it,its cult classic ""Push it to the limit"" says it all-this outstandingly,divinely decadent and lush track reminding of the not least famous theme from ""Neverending story""(both soundtracks being composed by the timelessly compelling genius Giorgio Moroder)represent a state,a mood,which makes the two so different films resemble:they are both lavish 80's modern legends,both dealing with initiating journeys,only that ""Scarface"" is a more violent,yet equally fascinating never-ending story about the almost mythical quest incited by unlimited ambition. Even this film's flaws-though unimportant-are the typical product of the eighties.The visuals are extremely unprofessional,during the entire film the image looking rather shabby due to extremely bleak,poor use of light and color,the viewer easily mistaking this film with a typical B-movie of that age,these commercial,cheap films seen on the rudimentary videotapes of that age including martial arts and boring,unpretentious amounts of pointless violence and nudity. Ironically this flaw mentioned above would taint every other cinematic masterpiece,however considering the subject,the B-movie quality is an advantage as it may be intentional to add to this film more ""hood"" credibility. Tony Montana is far more than a simple newly rich criminal,he is a complex ,at a certain degree,even barbarically,savagely heroic character.His famous speech in titled ""Make way for the bad guy"" is an interesting and uncomfortably ironic view at 1980's consumerism. While acknowledging that he is a typical product of his age he still finds the power to sneer at the lucrative,but superficial social establishment of this period. Pacino almost anticipates the not less controversial speech of his later character Frank Slade from ""Scent of a woman"",in both of the cases two harsh,macho-like yet innerly uncompromising characters revealing profound and radical truths in a uncensored,sharp language. One ends up considering the bad guy less immoral than the more respectable members of society-at least in Montana's case you know that he is a killer,a drug-dealer while other far more influential politicians and tycoons only knew to hide their speculations better,had respectable images and no criminal record. Especially in the 1980's U.S.,it was unimportant how to get rich,in Reaganism only the outcome mattered and while people like Montana were the scapegoats and/or the guys who did the dirty work so that more ""respectable"" people don't get soiled(in both cases Montana was useful to society and its ""pilars""),while more immoral people performed the same shady deals at a larger scale,comfortably hidden by their conventional WASP image and their superficial appearance of righteousness. Gifted with the ambition of a Shakespearean character,in Montana's case,in a twist differing from Shakespeare,it is not his ambition leading to his irremediable downfall.It may be partly explained that during the 1980's one couldn't be too ambitious and,unlike in the Shakespearean tragedy,even pathological,Machiavellian,unrestrained ambition hadn't a bad press. The only thing not allowed in this calculating,overly greedy age was to show your human side and while in the world of crime feelings were always an impediment,being so 1980's America(even if not as criminal)was the worst move possible.Like in the closing scene from Macbeth,Montana will be confronted with final consequence of his deeds with Shakespearean depth and intensity... Montana's rise and fall also remind of another typical gangster embodying the American Dream-Gatsby,even the pool where Montana is finally crashing into seem like a reference to the not less famous swimming pool scene. Both Montana and Gatsby are of humble origins,both craving for money and power,and after owning ""the world"" for a while,both have to discover the emptiness of the American Dream,both end up floating in a pool. Everything mentioned above and many more subtleties of this masterpiece almost turn it into a period drama about the recent past, a lavish portion of 1980's memorabilia combined with unexpected art film accomplishment and Pacino(along with Scent.. and Godfather)at his best.",

The soundtrack is also typical De Palma - tacky. The overall plot is very thin (you can make a lot of money out of drug-dealing, and you'll probably end up dead). However, De Palma's instinct for excess works well in this film, with the tracking-shots and the rich colours being ideally suited to the decadence resulting from having so much cash that you need machines to count it and helpers to carry it in to the bank. It's really Al Pacino that carries the film, though (how often have we said that?). His accent is a bit dodgy but apart from that he does a magnificent job in a multi-faceted role: charismatic male-buddy, charming ladies-man, street-smart operator, vicious tough-guy with a heart. You imagine what a great life he could've led if only he'd picked a different career! The scene in the restaurant where he rants at the 'straight' people is really the closest we get to the message of the film - it's just a shame that he had to be stoned: imagine what a speech he could've made if his mind was clear! I still prefer The Godfather(I & II) and Dog Day Afternoon, but we'll make this Al's 3rd-best performance.",

He is the representation of the human spirit that can accomplish anything and overcome any obstacle. I think most immigrants/people of low socio-economic status get inspired by his ambition. This movie does not advocate to sell drugs, but to make it big in America in any legitimate business(real estate, sales, whatever).

I generally like violent, gang/mafia/whatever you would like to call them type movie. I loved the Godfather Trilogy and am enthralled with the works of Tarentino, but Scarface was simply not that good. Its violence was overly dramatic and rare...mostly the focus was simply on Tony Montana, a character who was perhaps meant to inspire hatred or pity from me the viewer. Instead I felt passive; I did not like him, hate him, or care in any way about him. I was in fact more focused on the terrible acting being done around him. Pacino...was Pacino...and well he was the only reason I enjoyed this movie in the slightest. But for his fans I would not call this his best work, not even close to that. Taxi Driver, Godfather 1, Gigli, Scent of A Women, and Donnie Brasco are all better examples of his amazing talent.

Villains appear throughout the movie because they keep getting killed off. The principal villains who last the longest are Frank Lopez then Alejandro Sosa after Lopez is killed by Tony Montana. Tony is called to adventure when he refuses a low-paying offer with low risk for a high-paying risky cocaine buy that turns out to be a trap.

Tony has a psychotic, and in due course, murderous jealously of his sister and we are not left in too much doubt as to the incestuous connotations.

The story centers around a Cuban immigrant who comes from nothing to rise to the top of the drug world.  The road to top is paved with treachery and corpses.  Definitely not for the kiddies or the squeamish, Scarface gives us a dark, if not exaggerated look into the cocaine world.  The ever stylish Michelle Pfeiffer teams up with Pacino as his lady, but who finally sees the writing on the wall.  Good for her.

731,15 June 2005,fatleprechan,9, Brutal Cuban refugee Tony Montana murders his way to the top of a drug empire in 1980s Miami,"Although some critics panned Pacino's performance as over the top, and his Cuban accent as bordering on the absurd, the film has amassed an ample cult following over the years since its release. And Pacino himself has said on many occasions that 'Scarface' is his favorite film in which he has appeared. Despite his detractors many also thought that Pacino shined as the ruthless Tony Montana. An anti Castro Cuban criminal freed from the bonds of communism by the dictator's decree which casts out undesirables. He then lands on the shores of Miami along with his womanizing yet equally as murdering sidekick Manny, respectfully portrayed by Steven Bauer. It doesn't take Tony long to launch his own lethal version of the American Dream. There are many horrific killings throughout the film as Montana carves out his own terrifying niche in Miami's drug trade. Taken in by a local drug lord/Mercedes Benz dealer ( Robert Loggia ) Montana soon finds that his ambition to 'Get what is coming to him.' Which he describes as 'The world and everything in it.' is not without some pretty stiff competition which he is more than up to the task of meeting head on. The main trinket Montana wishes to add to his growing collection is his boss's live in girlfriend played by then newcomer Michelle Pfiffer in an excellent performance as a woman just as addicted to being kept as she is to the cocaine that she continually sniffs. But we never lose sight of Pacino in an engrossing portrayal of a homicidal maniac let loose on a free society after being so long repressed by a regime as terrible as he. The most amazing part about Pacino's performance is how both he and the audience are totally absorbed into the character, at some point you tend to forget that Pacino is in there. Although Montana seems larger than life, you will believe that he has a life of his own. And he takes many lives in this film. To say the violence in many of the scenes is gratuitous is a gross understatement. Often forgotten is Montana's blunt yet clever sense of humor. Just when you feel you can't stomach the gore anymore Pacino will deliver a shining sliver of wit that brings a grin. Interestingly Pacino and co-star Loggia used to dine and hit many of the South Beach night spots while still in character of their Scarface rolls. Like him or lump him Tony Montana has became a part of American culture. I say deservedly so. This is an excellent film. 9 out of a possible 10 T.H.",

734,3 April 2020,anti_heroi,7, Scarface is a good experince destroyed by Tony Montana clich√™s,"A movie that has a interesting propost and mensage, Scarface is a good work when it do a relation with a real historic fact, like the coming of cubans to United States (especially to Fl√≥rida) durring the socialist government of Fidel Castro, but it's a big clich√™ because of the building of the protagonist, Tony Montana. The cuban drug dealer, that build his criminal career in US, has a big different between other character interpretated by Al Pacino, Michael Corleone, of The Godfather trilogy, with his descontrolation and his personally extremally violent and authoritarian. It's like Tony Montana is a comic caricature full of various stereotypes of the bandit, not a reality artistic representation.
Scarface had a good base to be a good movie, but the way how Tony Montana was made destructed all the work. Everything about the protagonist is extreme, his violence and his authoritarism. Nothing is balanced in Tony Montana actions like he hasn't a ration and emotion control, but a supergo in his brain. Obvious the objective of Brian de Palma e Oliver Stone (director and roterist, respectively) was create an Antonio Montana irrational and unbalanced, but it's create a Tony Montana ufanist and alienated. All violence and arrogance that character use to fight in situations are show when the protagonist uses the word ""fvck"" 152 times in movie, showing his violence is not only fisic, but verbal too. The arrogance of Tony Montana transforme in a powerful energy when he think he can fight with the legion of Alejandro Sosa men when the bolivian drug dealer invade Tony Montana mansion, like a super man. Tony Montana isn't an admirable anti-hero, but a disgusting anti-hero, a character that express hate about Fidel Castro regime, who start his government in Cuba in 1959, but he is authoritarian like the cuban leader with all people, including his sister and his friend that died by Tony because of his relationship with Tony's sister.
The age when the movie live was a conturbade period, ideologically and polically. The cold war against URSS/Cuba and the american civil culture with armamentism and racism, the United States lived in an intensive fight. The violence of the movie is contraditory, because, in same time it can be understood like a representation of USA in this time, it's inexplicated (main Tony Montana) because the movie focus more in this violence than in history and operation of crime and its consequence to people, like made The Godfather, the best crime movie of history. The only consequence of crime showed in the film is Tony Montana death showed in a clich√™ form with the saying ""power corrupts the humans"", when the protagonist dies in his piscine with the saying ""power corrupts man"" that was old Tony boos Frank's piscine mansion. if the movie's mensage are converted to any politic history, for example, the clich√™s will be the same. If I can describe Scarface in a only sentences, will be: ""interesting, but clich√™"".",

I think the cinematography is amazing, besides the fact that I would put the legendary Al Pacino on my Mt. Rushmore of acting. This film has it all from an emotional standpoint. You feel the grief, the love, the pain, the greed. Tony's life comes full circle. His rise to power, is what becomes his ultimate heartbreaking demise. Scarface is well deserving of its rank as one of the greatest films of our modern era.",
738,21 October 2019,starry-2,7, An indulgent drug crime rags to riches fantasy.,"This film was too heavy and for some reason not a success upon its release. But like Blade Runner, it slowly gained a massive cult status and aged like fine wine, finding its place in cinema history. Written by Oliver Stone (who partook in 'method writing' (!) ) and directed by Brian DePalma, this violent and daring film is a relentless masterpiece, a study in rags to riches, criminality and narcissism to the extreme. Al Pacino is absorbed in this character that we forget its Pacino (the only other actors to do this that comes to mind were Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull and Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now). This movie is so early 80s in terms of its look and production design/sets that Miami becomes a character unto itself. (As is cocaine...the monetary motivator in this film). The movie plays out like a dream...the events unfold in a surrealistic way, things get more disturbing and chaotic and ruthless as it goes on. The main character and his co-hort are confronted with so many challenges and their daring sacrificial attempts at making it rich at the expense of anything/anyhow/anywhere is sonewhat cool and amusing, all in a disturbing way. The music score is novelty yet epic, and it's no wonder that the rap music culture took heart to this movie due to its romance with violence and brutality and the flexing of money. This isn't for everyone but worth a look- it's one of DePalma's finest commercial films and kudos go to Universal's executives who saw fit to invest in producing this film because it makes sense and gets better with every year that passes. The 4k bluray looks amazing. Technology is so good these days that the amount of film grain seems to be easily controlled. For an old film, this digital transfer makes this film look like its shot in the early 2000s, making this more appealing for the most scrutinizing viewer who thinks any movie older than 5 years is too aged and not visually appealing. The hdr contradt and colors are punchy and vibrant and for the first time since its theatrical release, we finally get to see this film as it was intended to be seen in all its south Florida razor blade glory. (Previous versions, from VHS to laser disc to early days of dvd looked and sounded flat). The soundtrack/soundeffects are more hi fi than ever making this a good fit/competitor with films all throughout the last 20 years. I rate the movie a 7 out of 10. The technical presentation is visual: 5 out of 5 and 4.5 for the audio. This film is a good commercial curio done in the spirit of a guerilla indie film. An indulgent crime fantasy to the extreme.",
739,11 April 2005,leoez,10, Greatest Movie Ever,"Scarface begins in 1980 in Miami. The Mariel Boatlift is in progress and one man is about to live the American Dream. He is Antonio Montana and is one of the most memorable characters in film history. Tony begins in a refugee camp under I-95 and quickly becomes Miami's top drug-lord. Of course he makes many enemies along the way. Tony is ruthless and cruel killing his best friend and bringing down his sister by bringing her into the drug culture. Eventually power, greed and paranoia take over and Tony is a wreck the cocaine doesn't help either. The ending is a cinematic masterpiece and Tony goes out in the most gansta way possible a enormous shootout with him and his one time ally the Bolivians. Despite the violence it has much deeper meaning than just the flash. The immigrant dream is won and is a great depiction of what the immigrants thought America was like. Also it tells a powerful story of what greed, power and wealth can do. If you are ready to experience the greatest movie ever made rent Scarface.",

756,16 October 2006,booyatom,9, You won't sleep through this one.,"Mountains of cocaine, pools of blood, piles of dropped f-bombs, and only one Tony Montana. Was Al Pacino's performance exaggerated? If, for a viewer, Al Pacino's performance was sub-par, so then was Scarface as a whole. Indeed, Pacino's portrayal of a Cuban immigrant and future drug lord, makes or breaks the film, and I'm quite sure both Brian De Palma and Oliver Stone knew this. De Palma did his best to fashion the film around Pacino and, as a matter of fact, he's in every single scene of the film. So, again, if Pacino's Tony Montana irritated you, then you didn't like the film. The thing that amazes me is the way De Palma made this film appeal to so many people. For those of you who can't get enough of shootouts and bloodbaths, here's one for you. For those who love gangster films, enjoy! Stone brilliantly shows Tony's ascent in the drug industry. Personally, Scarface made me understand the workings of the illicit business world more than The Godfather did. Allow me to explain. The Godfather began with The Family already established and illustrated how difficult and competitive that part of the world can be as well as the concept of retribution. Now, I know the Godfather II showed Vito Corleone's ascent, but that just got me thinking: ""Is it that simple?"" Scarface I believe is more patient. It really takes its time. We really see how Tony made a name for himself and how he gets his connections. Apart from establishing Tony's creds and his handling of business affairs, the film is out of control; not in the bad sense, most of the time. From Tony's first job, involving Colombian cocaine pushers to a certain chainsaw, to the last out-of-whack scene, the film just won't let you go. It's smart, concise when it wants to and necessarily brutal. The film would probably not be considered a classic if it was all powdered up and had less blood, gore, swears and drugs than it does. It lives up to its material alright; it doesn't just talk big, it lives big.",

I particularly claim that the acting of Al Pacino in this film is the greatest ever. If you ask me what the antisocial personality anomaly is than I would show you the portrait, Tony Montana. We face a lot of dilemmas about this portrait. There is always an inconsistency in the behavior of Tony. He makes something that he feels regret for that but at the end he does not compensate for what he did. This is the general actions of Tony which is portrayed by Al Pacino magnificently. What is indisputable is that the accent of Tony is really fantastic which forces you not to believe that Al Pacino is not a Cuban. ",

The lines in this movie are absolutely great and heartfilled and I think that Al Pacino definetly deserved an Oscar for making this film along with Brian Depalma. Also Michelle Pfeiffer plays a good role in this performance as Frank Lopez's snotty wife who Tony loves. You can say that Tony loves hard to get woman. This reflects his attitude because his attitude says he can do anything because he has ""balls"". Tony looks down on people who he feels doesn't have ""balls"" and called them ""Cocaroches"".

772,17 January 2019,judejensen,10, Classic Gangster film,"""Scarface"" is probably my favorite gangster movie, though I think ""The Godfather: Part 2"" and ""Casino"" are overall better films, I prefer ""Scarface"" for nostalgic reasons. I first saw this movie when I rented it from my local Library when I was about 11 or 12 years old, I watched it, and I was blown away. Al Pacino plays a refugee from Cuba. He's struggling to earn money, so he starts selling drugs. He starts off as a pretty likeable character, but slowly turns into a monster. Though, he's not a complete monster, he refuses to blow up a car, because there are kids inside. You see a man rise to the top of the world, until his anger and lust for power are eventually his downfall. And who could forget about the shootout scene at the end? It includes probably the most famous movie quote of all time- ""Say Hello, To My Lil Friend!!!""",

What were Pacino's detractors hoping for? Something internal and realistic? Low key? The Tony Montana character is above all a performance artist, a man who exists in order to gloriously be himself. The dominant mood of the film is anything but funny. It is bleak and futile: What goes up must always come down. When it comes down in Scarface, the crash is as terrifying as it is vivid and arresting. An unashamed study of selfish, sadistic criminality, and all the better for it. It's a whole new spin on the immigrant story and the American Dream as an underworld nightmare and a fitting bookend to the two Godfather films.",

Terry malloy, Coreleone, Travis Bickle, Hannibal, Superman.  If superman were corrupted and from Puerto Rico he would be Tony Montana.

The way Tony Montana captures the ""American Dream"" in this story about a Cuban immigrant trying to make it in this country is with out a doubt historical. Starting in an illegal alien camp, working his way to washing dishes, and then eventually becoming a multi-millionaire Cocaine Kingpin. Scarface shows you the highs and lows of Tony Montana's life.

The anti-hero Montana is someone with whom we can identify with, because the movie questions how far we are willing to go in order to gain ""the world"".

The acting is terrific. Al Pacino - enough said. He can do any role that he puts his mind to, and this was no exception. Pretty boy Steven Bauer, as Manny. I didn't think much of him in other films he did, but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma's direction. Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira. Popping' fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in ""Grease 2"" she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye. But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony's sister Gina, who when she smiles, or cries, we see her soul and her fresh way of living, and watch it deteriorate; Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa, a drug lord, who runs deeper than a river, and Shenar portrays him as so; and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina's torn mother. These three dig the film as deep as it can go.",
828,22 May 2010,jowshihuh,4, B-film Quality,"In my defense, I was really expecting to like this film. It has, unfortunately, not aged well at all; every scene screams this to me. I'll agree, Pacino can do a mean accent, and I felt fine with his performance. The other actors, unfortunately, fell short. Also, some of the more violent scenes felt like they were forced into the film. It's no secret that the crowds dig unique ways of killing off characters. I have a feeling Stone thought one day, 'Hey, I bet chainsaws would be great,' or 'Hanging from helicopters sounds like the bomb!' and then found his chance to (clumsily) throw that into this film. It's also well known that they dig swearing, so f-bombs are thrown all over the place. Now, I know what you're thinking, and that's that I am offended by all of this. I'm perfectly content with graphic content if it works, but in this case, it just seemed to not fit. At last, to somehow make people think they were watching something more than an action flick, which this kinda is. But wait, how could we possibly end this story. Eureka, I've got it: go Nicholas Sparks on the script! Tony's last day is his worst, and then a skinny version of the terminator does what about fifteen hair metal rockers fail to do, which is sticking bullets in poor Tony's spine. He then makes a dramatic dive down to his fountain, where we meet a motif (which the crowds also dig) and then the film's over. At the end, I think I was supposed to feel sorry for Tony (I mean, the guy doesn't kill kids, so he's good, right?). Overall, the bad slightly outweighs the good (which techno scores are still cool, okay?!), and this ends up only being a mediocre film with all of the elements to draw in the crowds.",

It's a classic, it's got plot, it makes sense, and it's directed by Brian De Palma (Untouchables).

It's feature some incredible acting, a great 80's atmosphere and some of the greatest movie quotes all time. There are so much violence, also there are some De Palma's demonstration of talent. The director shows his attributes by moving his camera in a subversive way, using all the possibilities of every piece of frame. There are some incredible scenes, sequences and one of the best ending sequences ever. The character's personalities are well developed, in a way you can't avoid feel empathic about then. Nothing but a great, classic, genius and entertaining flick. Simply awesome and great. The best Pacino's work, no doubt.",

For 1, I have NEVER overly liked Pacino, he overacts in most of his movies (espically after the early 90's.) Also, this movie is just soooo over the top. With people being shot dozens of times, still standing and barely flinching. Or how about Pacinos character taking a nosedive into a pile of coke that could most likely kill a good sized elephant? This movie is good, but i don't believe it is worth all the hype. It is NOT up there with godfather, casino, untouchables, or any of the other classic gangster movies.

The use of gore and violence is brilliantly done, as it is entertaining but not gratuitous; it is used to put a point across. The casting is perfect; Pacino is brilliant as the ruthless and eventually paranoid Tony Montana, Steven Bauer does a great job as the right hand man Manny Ray, and flank characters like Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio)contribute nicely to the overall plot. Excellent stuff from Brian dePalma, and a personal favourite of mine.",

846,13 June 2006,finsnasty845,6, Solid but over rated,"When one thinks of an epic crime film many consider Scarface a ""great movie"". But, to me that isn't the case. It has entertaining qualities but really doesn't have the cinematography or dialog to live up to Goodfellas or the Godfather (part 1 and part 2). Al Pacino does a very good job but he really is the only top name actor in this movie. Rather than developing the story he almost automatically becomes a driving force in Miami. Which to me is totally unrealistic. The dialog is mediocre at best. There is no true acting it, is just a non-stop Al Pacino being angry the entire time. I enjoyed certain parts of Scarface but it is a very overrated movie.",
847,11 August 2020,willkelsey,4, Save 3hrs of your life and watch any other Pacino film,"Scarface did not live up to expectations. The film drags on to the point of boredom because what this film crucially lacks is unpredictability. This in turn is symptomatic of the film lacking any real character development; none whatsoever for any non-pov character and very little for the main character Tony Mantana. The film is essentially about greed, power, and corruption and the effects of these on a person in power (other explanations are somewhat explored in it such as effects of migration and stunted emotional intelligence due to poor conditions in upbringing but not in any notable length). However, the film is not an exploration into these dark features of humanity because from the beginning of the film Mantana (Pacino) is already insatiably tyrannical. There is no character ark in which to grip the audience or to make them feel any attachment to Tony, and thus, the meaningless ending (which I will come to) makes the audience feel nothing if not glad that the film has drawn to its predictable close. The film's landmarks are brutal episodes involving guns and blood. The flaws in these are twofold: firstly they are tiresomely predictable with one being directly foretold by Tony in a previous scene; and secondly, they are pretty poorly shot in terms of genuine good cinematic experience. This means the relief that comes from the banality of the rest of a film that has a fairly poor script really just offers more banality. Elsewhere I have trouble understanding the sense and point of Michelle Pfeiffer's character. Her initial reaction to Mantana shows absolutely no correspondence with her later actions (treading carefully not to give away spoilers). Furthermore, her lack of agency and interest is indicative of the way women are viewed and portrayed in the film and this is definitely one of the films that has aged badly. The final complaint is the ending which again is pretty boring in terms of gangster violence and again entirely predictable. The fashion of the ending being both fruitless and completely lacking in surprise or thrill confirms everything you should be thinking throughout most of the film. Without brief spells of good acting from Pacino and Pfeiffer this film would have been cast onto the pile of useless gangster films. For 3 hours you could do much better without having to even stray from the lead actor. You have been warned.",
848,24 March 2003,mrkilmer1,10, An American crime classic.,"After watching Scarface my thoughts were along the lines of ""Wow that was a great movie."" This was undoubtedly Pacino's best work (other than the Godfather Part 1). As well as having Pacino as the leading charactor Scarface is similar to the #1 ranking movie of all time, The Godfather. Both films have family morals, violence, and passion. One thing I believe that holds this movie back from being rated up with Godfather is the amount violence, there is hardling a scene where there is not gore or the F word being said. If you can get past the overkill of violence you will find a film that centers around a man that wants non other than the American Dream.",
849,3 March 2011,udit_sabharwal,8, It's just not the mafia,To make things clear from the very start. This ain't no mafia amigos so there ain't no class in the film. The sheer beauty of the mafia lies in their simple yet deep thinking brains and strong family values. Scarface is something that is absolutely against all of that. While the movie features Al Pacino who I must commend handles the role with the utmost ease perhaps his portrayal of Michael Corleone cannot seem to get out of my head. Sure he's playing with the big boys now with bigger guns and loads of cash and he's a lot dumber too with a drug addict for a wife. Sure it ain't no Godfather but it is cuban in the making. It is everything the godfather is not and perhaps that is why it loses out on it's class,
850,28 April 2016,socclgr,7, Scarface review,"Scarface (1983) is a classic gangster flick full of suspense, money, and of course guns. Al Pacino plays Tony Montana, a hotheaded Cuban immigrant that climbs the drug business along with his friend Manny. Unlike other gangster films, Tony isn't supported by his family and has no in to the drug industry. The 1983 film is a remake of a past version made in 1932. The 1983 version directed by Brian De Palma is of course more extreme because of the upgrade in special effects and uses more dedicated method actors. Compared to other famous gangster films like The Godfather trilogy (1972-1990), Scarface (1983) is definitely darker and gorier. The movie has all the aspects to fit in the gangster/crime genre. There's the mafia, money, power, the boss and underdog, the damsel in distress, greed, guns, blood, and drugs. De Palma creates suspense with shots like the close up front shots of Tony and the chaotic ringing noise in the background letting us know that he's about to snap and something's about to happen. The lighting in the movie is mostly natural light that's used symbolically (day=innocent night=deception).For example, when it's bright and ""daytime"" in a scene everything is normal. Then when the lighting appears to be used to show that its ""night time"" that's when all the gangster acts take place. During the final scene, which is also Tony's death scene, we see Tony front on as he is shouting at the top of the staircase. Then as he is shot in the back and killed, the angle switches to us looking down at his body as he falls into the pool. This is very symbolic of his change in power, from low too high to rock bottom. Another staircase angle shot is when Tony comes over to Manny's looking for Gina, only to find her in a robe at the top of the stairs looking down at him and smiling. Being used to a more traditional Italian gangster movie Scarface (1983) was surprising and a little hard to take from the content and blood. Overall it was a classic film with a good story-line, full of some amazing timeless actors/actresses. It's defiantly a movie that leaves you feeling uneasy, without a ""happy ending"", and I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in gangster/crime or action flicks. I give it a 7/10.",

This may give you an idea that Scarface is a ""gangster movie"". Sure, there are gangsters and mobs in it, but that's not the point of Scarface. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a cuban refuge looking for a new way of life. He falls in with the mob group and becomes a well-known drug lord. Montana was all for doing what you wanted to do with your life. The classic phrase: ""Say hello to my little friend!"" is in Scarface. This quote is what always comes to mind when I think about Brian DePalmas movie, Scarface. This falls under my top 10 favorite movies. I would rate it ***1/2 (out of ****).

854,30 August 2012,christophergob,10, One of the Best Crime Movies Ever Made,"Scarface, a crime-drama directed by Brian De Palma, is an artistic film that depicts a rise and fall (allegory to classic Greek fables) of a gangster who gets everything, but at the same time, loses everything in his life. This movie has amazing drama, exceptional acting, and bloody, exhilarating action. Al Pacino (The Godfather 1 and 2, Dog Day Afternoon) who plays the avaricious, antisocial Cuban immigrant Tony Montana (who has a scar on his face due to his unknown childhood trauma) who wishes to pursue the American Dream when arriving in Miami, Florida with his loyal best friend, Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer, an underrated actor). He decides to follow the dark side to exceed his prospects. Tony does a hit job on a corrupt politician (exposition) for crime boss, Frank Lopez, who has a soft spot. Thus, Tony starts to escalate. As Tony explains to Manny ""first, you get the money, then the power, then the women,"" he becomes charmed with Frank's cocaine-addict oblivious wife, Elvira (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) and wants Frank gone, so he can take control of the cocaine empire. While Tony is working for Frank, he has an almost incestuous relationship (I dunno) with his sister, Gina Montana and is very protective of her because he doesn't want her to be corrupted. Later in the movie, Tony makes a deal with sadistic cocaine drug lord, Sosa, who tells Tony not to screw him, and argues with his Frank about the deal the he made. Frank explains to Tony that Sosa is a snake and not trust-worthy. Tony doesn't believe this and starts fooling around with Frank's wife. Frank's assassins attack Tony in a luxury club, but he escapes luckily and confronts Frank. Tony kills him for his betrayal and takes over the empire. Tony gets everything, but slowly goes insane when he keeps doing cocaine. His relationship with Elvira falls apart after marrying her. Also, he has problems with the FBI force. Manny secretly dates Tony's sister without telling him. Then, Tony makes another deal with Sosa that they would both solve each other's problems by doing favors for each other. During the climax, Tony has to whack a journalist that could enervate Sosa's business by putting him in jail, but Tony has a sense of morality when he doesn't want to kill the journalist's family when they are in the car with the journalist, so Tony decides not to. Tony fueled by cocaine, later, founds out that Manny was having sex with his sister at his sister's house, and kills Manny cold-blooded. Back at his huge mansion, Tony goes infuriated when Sosa angrily calls him about the failed job. After snorting so much cocaine, Tony has lost a sense of reality, while Sosa's men sneak in the mansion to kill Tony. Tony's sister is killed, so Tony grabs a gun to shoot at the doors of his luxurious office and says the most famous line in the movie, ""Say hello to my little friend"" and blasts the doors open. He starts killing people madly while they are shooting at him. One of the Sosa's top assassins sneaks in the window of Tony's office and shoots Tony in the back. Tony, now dead, falls down into the water fountain on the main floor. There is blood everywhere. The music starts playing as Tony's empire is annihilated. The action in this movie is pretty spectacular because it was influenced by John Woo's action films. There are a few shootouts in the movie: one in an apartment, one in a night club, and lastly, one in the mansion at the end. The moral of Scarface is that people shouldn't take advantage of the American Dream by taking short cuts. Also, the movie also has a message that you shouldn't do drugs since they will corrupt you, just like committing crimes.",

In Muni character violence is essential and a particular language to deal with a world open for anyone that can handle it. Muni, at the opposite side of Pacino, is very human, human to act and human to die, and he die as his boss die under his hands, how any criminal, in a good tale about moral and the right way to do things define, must to die: praying for his life, defenseless against a society that is a lot more than him. Its not a minor point, in fact its a huge point, the radical difference between Muni shoot dead for policemen without excess and Pacino fighting some kind the little war against numberless henchmen send by a drug Bolivian landlord. A lot more credible is also the Muni sister reaction, who at last just must to recognize the undeniable fact that both are the same because are in the same side of the world, than the Pacino sister with all that twisted incestuous allusion, besides the incredible bad skill with the gun.

Al Pacino portrays a character that seems somewhat exaggerated but is perfect in conveying how immigrants from Cuba would have to act in order to be/become successful. It is baffling to know that the movie was not such a big hit initially. Now, it has become eminent in movie history. Pacino is actually recognized more as Tony Montana rather than Al Pacino. His performance in this movie was unfortunately looked over at the time but finally he was recognized on how great of an actor he is.

Even though you don't see anything the Chainsaw scene will still make you want to turn away, but at the same time it has its kinder moments even when its mixed with violence.

Montana does not want to kill the kids, but the guy who holds the bomb is still planning on blowing them up. Montana gets angry and shoots the guy carrying the bomb because he does not want the kill kids. The only reason i gave this 9/10 instead of 10/10 is because there are often moments where you feel like you've seen them before. Maybe its just me and i need to see it again.",
878,9 December 2004,robert_180sx,9, Awesome!!!!!!!!,"This film superbly illustrates the American dream and one gangsters rise from the gutter all the way to the top. This film has you entranced from beginning to end and for those that say they cannot sympathies with Tony Montana i disagree. The man had values and morals(he didn't blow up that car with the wife and kids inside)and all the people he killed were all bad guys anyway. He did what had to be done period! It's sad when he dies at the end of the film. The last scene of the film depicting Tony Montana's demise is the best shootout scene in movie history. With the immortal line ""say hello to my little friend"". I give this film 5/5. Brilliant!!!!!!",
879,9 July 2006,graphixauthority,10, Not In The IMDb Male Top 100 !?!?!,"I cannot believe that I didn't see this movie in the Male Top 100 list. That right there tells me the list is very flawed. I have yet to meet a guy who didn't think this was, at the very least, a Top 10'r of all time. This is coming from across the board both ethnically and economically too. I'm impressed with the fact that Oliver Stone and De Palma actually spent time with Southern Florida drug-dealers, for over a month, to add to the realism of this urban rags to riches story. I'm not going to sit here and explain this and that because everyone should have seen this flick by now. Al Pacino was way more challenged playing this role than his Godfather character. Number 234????. I'm speechless.",
880,25 October 2004,dunbar_10,9, A fantastic journey,"This movie is simply an epic masterpiece. It is one of those films that will be remembered and imitated for years to come, it has a huge following still, over twenty years later and has influenced some of the greatest movies since then. Al Pacino gives an Oscar worthy performance as Tony Montana, a determined and streetwise Cuban immigrant who overcomes several obstacles to reach the level of success that he has by the end of the movie. Al Pacino is loud and intense in this movie, displaying one of the most famous accents in movie history, and he does it masterfully. The supporting cast is very talented, with Steven Bauer as his right hand man and best friend.",
881,15 October 2008,matty-tildesley,10, Brian De palma's finest hour,"Brian De palma can be proud to call this masterpiece his best work. De palma and Pacino combine brilliantly to create a character that you love to hate and hate to love. Tony Montana is dark, sinister and completely obsessed with power and yet he has morals and values that he holds above all. the combination of his deep, captivating and contradictory character eventually lead to his downfall. De palma however does so much more with this film than just a character profile. his portrayal of Tony's rapid rise to the top of Miami's drug empire and his eventual downfall is excellent. Tony's fight to the top is filled with death and betrayal as well as some brutal set pieces. his drive to be boss is a double edged sword as it is both his desire to be more than just another working slack and his insatiable greed that fuel him. his brutal rise is complemented smoothly by the emptiness De palma portrays when Tony is at the top. everything in his life is false from his backhanded bank to the bodyguards who just need a job to his wife who was married to the boss Tony murdered. Everything around Tony Montana is a fake and causes him to drive away his family and succumb to extreme paranoia. all of this truly comes out thanks to a brilliant performance by Al pacino. However what turns this film into a classic is the way in which it portrays the dark side of the American dream although on an extreme premise. Tony is no different from many people who wish to be more than a dish washer or a cleaner but cannot realise that money will jot bring happiness. his greed and power-lust cause his alienation from his family and spark a chain of events that leads to his death. this film has brilliant direction, some brutal and exciting action scenes as well as a good script that has deep powerful themes and a stand out performance from Pacino to pull all these elements together into one of the most memorable characters in film history. a masterpiece and a must watch. 10/10",
882,15 December 2012,domscarfacer,10, His World,"This movie is a masterpiece. Tony Montana starts a new life in America. But he becomes a gangster. Brian depalma directs, and Al Pacino does a terrific performance as Tony. You really believe he is a gangster. The ending is one of the most epic endings to date. This movie will be watched for ever. Tony isn't scared of anything. This movie is definitely better than the 1932's one. In the 1932's version he is Italian. In this version he is Cuban. I think that just adds to the awesomeness. Because his accent is so ridiculous over the top. The amount of cocaine in this movie is insane. This is not a kids movie. Please watch this movie. 10/10",
883,23 August 2004,harrytong76228,10, the most of the century..,"Tony Montana is not just another character in movies, he is just like any other guy in this country. America was build upon immigrants and throughout the decades this was forgotten and America was sterotyped as a ""white mans"" country and sadly it still is. But what made the movie Scarface different from all the others is not just of the ultra violent scenes, but the American dream Tony Montana had even though he was an immigrant he went from poverty to prosperity. This movie is a voice to all the immigrants living and making up for the miniority of the population but soon will grow. He sad it best "" You all are assholes, cause you know why? You don't have the guts to be what you want to be"" I know now that I want to be just like Tony Montana.",
884,2 April 2003,Mr_White2003,10, Truly Brilliant,"The film is one of the greatest gangster movies of all time with some terrific performances especially Al Pacino, although as great as he is, he extends himself to great lengths in this movie to make us sometimes hate & sometimes love Tony Montana. I think this is just one thing which makes Pacino so great is the fact that he can look like either a bad guy or a good guy and he can act like a bad guy or a good guy as well. In Scarface the performance is just brilliant & i don't think there is anyone who could of played the role better. He has everything right from the accent right down to his manerisms and the way he speaks. As a big fan of Pacino i love almost all of his movies (apart from City Hall) & counting out the Godfather Part 1 & 2 i would say this is his best movie & if you are a fan of his or a fan of Brian De Palma watch this movie! It has one of the greatest endings in movie history, has an awsome soundtrack & set the record for the ""F Word"" being used most in a film! Screw the Oscars they don't know anything as Pacino should of atleast had a nomination for Best Actor & screw those crappy Razzie Awards for nominating De Palma as Worst Director he directs this movie excellently!",
885,24 December 2012,SwagAli,10, You won't catch Tony Montana begging for his life,"Everyone knows who Scarface is. Growing up, Scarface was the movie you could catch any of your friends watching on any given day (at least your guy friends). The movie was and still is one of the most quoted of all time, and Tony Montana, played by Al Pacino, is one of the great characters of our time. I have watched this film many times and it never gets old.",
886,14 April 2005,CREAMMAN25,9, Scarface,"I believe scarface is one of the greatest films out there because of the amount of joy you get out of the performances from the actors and actresses involved who all have great characters to play ,Al Pacino who plays Tony Montana the lead character migrates to Miami in United States of America from Cuba, because of the country's hard times, delivers all too perfectly with the rest of the cast. This film is covered with great performances and Al Pacino/Tony Montana delivers some classics stuff which gives this film a timeless dynamic which means you could watch this film more then once and still come back for more.",
887,30 September 2004,Scott_10,10, My All Time Fav Film,"This film is my all time favourite though i have not seen Godfather which is also supposed to be a unique film . The film is a very good outlook at the drug scene back in the 80's and also how greed can take over anyones life. The rise of Montana is an epic one but so also is his downfall. As he is told early on in the film "" Don't get high on your own supply"" which is ironic as this is exactly what he does and he pays the consequnces for it. Brian De Palma directed this film to perfection and is probably his best film. People say that it is too violent though i believe the violence is appropriate to the plot of the film. People may disagree with what i have said but this is my opinion so if anyone would like to discuss this film or any other just write back.",

891,5 August 2017,burke-gary29,7, Gangster film!,"In the tradition of the Godfather films, director Brian DePalma has brought Oliver Stone's creation Scarface to the big screen. It is the archetypal 'rags to riches' story of a young Cuban refugee named Tony Montana. Al Pacino more than fulfils this role as he conveys the ruthless nature of Montana and likewise the ruthless nature of Miami's Cocaine underworld. Although Montana's ultimate position in life is morally wrong, he is a character with unequalled resolve. DePalma brings the audience not only into the inner recesses of Montana's world, but also the reality of the world that he has built.",

It is better than 'the Godfather' for a few simple reasons: first of all, in one single movie, you see the start of a character, the raise to power and the downfall. Secondly, you get to see the transformation of more than one character and in several relationships, just as between Tony and Sosa, and Manny and Gina.",

Al Pacino puts out a remarkable performance as Tony Montana and this film is a must have in all collections. If you have not seen this film i advise you do so as soon as possible and i promise you will not be left unsatisfied. This was the film that without a doubt put Al Pacino on the map to being the best actor in the world.

And he always used to say the word ""fuck"". That got me laughing how he even said that to United States oficials and bankers.

900,11 October 2017,jaimedeluis,5," Short review about my thoughts of ""Scarface""","Personally, I expected more about this film. Great plot, good argument, one of the best directors... but there is something that sends this all to the ground. Maybe it's the length of the film. Maybe it's the flat action, or maybe it's Al Pacino's madness that leads to an implausible final, where a complete unknown character seems to be the star of the film by shooting Montana. And I didn't liked the time lapses: 1 month, 3 months, 3 years... Hopefully the film ended before we had to wait 2 generations till we enter the action. I have to say that visual effects of the actors when getting shoot were really crafted. And that Brian DePalma is one of my favorite directors, but this film isn't what I thought.",
901,21 February 2006,mca3930,10, A Timeless Masterpiece,"This is probably one of the best films I have ever seen. The acting is superb, the story is excellent, and the direction is fantastic. Al Pacino gives his best role to date as drug kingpin Tony Montana and his rise and demise. Fine supporting roles are given by Steven Bauer, F.Murray Abraham, Robert Loggia, and Paul Shenar. What makes this movie so masterful is the fact that when you watch it, you become in it. Also, it isn't easy to get an audience to root for a ruthless drug kingpin, but Brian De Palma pulls it off. Case in point, if you haven't seen this movie before, see it. You won't be sorry. If I could give thin movie eleven stars, I would. 10 stars out of 10.",
902,3 March 2005,Mistyckel,10, An opening eye for a reality unseen...,Truly an amazing movie. For anyone to criticize this movie on it's gore or violence shows ignorance for the movie's scene. How can you portray a school without children? How can you portray a drug lord without violence? Sure it has it's cinematic over-spurs as any movie would but they are surely justified by the conclusion of the main character. Truly a movie worth the time to watch or even buy. Not one for the younger kids. A story of a Cuban coming to the United States with a dream of freedom only to be locked down like most Americans by financial burdens. Instead of taking the common burdened path this driven Cuban chooses an alternative risk for reward route and climbs to a level of success unseen by the vast majority of society.,

905,5 April 2014,Geylani-Ibrahim,9, critic review for scarface,"As many classical movies, a category of genres control the main act of each movie. Joining drugs, explicit scenes, and gory crimes. Directed by Brian De Palma, the movie Scar Face (1983), talks about the 1980s period in Miami, Tony Montana (Al Pacino), a Cuban immigrant takes over a drug cartel while succumbing to greed. The movie got nominated for 6 awards including ""Best Performance by an actor in a motion picture"" for Al Pacino and ""and best classic DVD release"". The initial critical response to Scarface was mixed, with criticism over excessive violence, frequent strong language and graphic hard drug usage. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. Contemporary reviews have been more positive, and screenwriters and directors have notably praised the movie. It is now considered a classic within the mob film genre and has resulted in many cultural references such as in comic books and video games. In my opinion Scarface really is a good movie to watch, its mature and gory scenes make it look like real events and that the movie was well developed. i recommend watching such movie.",
906,30 April 1999,Zarathustra,10," Al Pacino's greatest film, an American epic.",Scarface is Al Pacino's greatest work as an actor.  His portrayal of a Cuban refugee turned drug cartel leader is intense and believeable.  The movie epitomizes the dream of the American underworld and Tony Montana is a Gatsby like figure that is unsatisfied by the attainment of his dream that he pursued so long and hard for.  Michelle Pfiefer as Elvira Pacino's eventual wife and Steven Bauer as Manny his lifelong friend just add to Pacino's rivetting performance.  This movie has more memorable scenes than I could dare to recall.  The passion and realness of Pacino's acting are unparalleled.,
907,24 April 2005,leoxiang,10, scarred up for life - the spiritual side of scarface,"Much of the good things have already been said about scarface, to say it as a landmark film in the gangster genre is definitely without a doubt. Critics from the very first release of this movie have complained about the 210 f words and the violence, but these are things that are necessary to a gangster picture, especially one that represents a dynasty. (each gangster movie has a different style of doing violence, the 'cleaner' ones are that of godfather and once upon a time in America, De Palma's choice of violence in this movie is only to enhance the viewing, whether you like it or not, it is up to you. As a viewer, you should only have the right to comment on the quality of such style rather than completely denigrating it) Having said all that, i now turn to the issue that has not been discussed often on this board. To a segment of viewers, Scarface is not a drug movie, it's more about the determination for power, to go higher and higher in the world. There are no other issues that are more important than this, Bregman, the producer wanted the movie to head this way because it shows something that is inside everyone of us. Some of the viewers do not openly agree, but this is the main reason most of the fans are drawn to this movie. This movie represents the reality of the world, that to achieve success, you somewhat have to inherit Tony's traits. Tony's strength in front of the chainsaw, his wit when facing Sosar and his determination in the argument between Frank for the $15m deal are all very admirable and respectable. The audience love these parts, it is not wrong to respect someone who has paid a price to achieve his goals even though he did so through a rather evil but common street business of the time.",
