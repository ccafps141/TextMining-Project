0,6 March 2017,zkonedog,10," So Much More Than Just A ""Shark Movie""","Reputationally-speaking, ""Jaws"" will forever be known for two things: director Steven Spielberg's unique ""shark-eye view"" camera work and building of suspense, and composer John Williams' two note ""attack"" motif that became as iconic as any piece of music ever created. Perhaps those two aspects alone would have been enough to make ""Jaws"" an iconic film--who knows. But the fact is, this 1975 effort is about so much more than just suspense/horror. It is one of the most well-rounded, complete movies ever made.",/
1,17 December 2013,gogoschka-1,10, One of the experiences that made me fall in love with movies,"I will never forget the first time I saw Jaws. I was glued to the seat from start to finish. I jumped, I held my breath; this was one of the experiences that made me fall in love with movies. This was probably the first film where I completely forgot everything around me. I was there, in that boat, in that gloomy cabin, with those people - everything seemed so real (and alas, the sea never looked the same again). When I watch it these days I still marvel: the atmosphere and the performances in this film are simply magical. Spielberg without the schmalz. He has never been better.",r
2,1 January 2022,planktonrules,9," Even with very dated technology, this is a great film to watch.","Back in 1975, ""Jaws"" made a huge splash (pardon the pun) in theaters. It set all sorts of box office records and made the covers of magazines all over the country. And, the film was seen as groundbreaking and amazing. When seen today, it's still a great film to watch even with it's very dated technology. In other words, the shark often looks very fake but the story is so good and handled so well, you really don't care. Excellent acting, a very nice script and excellent direction make this a definite must-see.",e

4,23 May 2017,fairlesssam,9, A monster of a movie,I re-watched this film recently and was blown away by the absolute suspense it invoked in me.

What a great one to start with, right? This movie not only scarred me out of the water, I was afraid to go to the bathroom! I thought Jaws was going to pop up out of the toilet and bite my butt! :D I know it was silly, but that was how much Jaws effected me. I know also that it has not lost it's effect to this day. I'm questioning, because it seems like all the terrific horror films came out of the 70's.",e
6,8 November 2016,Idiot-Deluxe,10, JAWS = Timeless Cinema,"It's true, few movies tell a story better and in a more compelling way than JAWS - the original summer blockbuster, which was a world-wide smash-hit or ""phenomenon"" upon it's initial release in May of 1975. Forty-one years later it still stands as one of the best movies of all time and having seen it well over 100 times in the past 30 years, I can firmly attest to it's extreme longevity and at this point it would seem JAWS' ability to entertain me, myself and the masses is indefatigable. In other words: JAWS IS ETERNAL. An ageless, universally beloved masterpiece and due to the films great originality, it has always been easy for me to admire it.",w

You do realize this was 1975 and was a one of a kind Cinematic Masterpiece. Receiving oscars because it was great, ahead of its time. Also starting the career of Spielberg. Some of you people (that's right I said it ) make me laugh thinking movies started in the 2000s, go back and watch it and then realize it's time of release and the impact it had on the Cinema, before you say it's not groundbreaking and surely before YOU can compare it to Sharknado, Meg, and other ridiculous CGI hacks! People will be talking about this CLASSIC long after you and I are making our meaningless reviews, 10*s if ever a movie deserves it.",/
8,29 August 2016,Tweekums,10, Spielberg's original blockbuster,"On the fictional New England resort island of Amity tourism is the main industry and each summer the beaches are backed with people hoping to swim in its beautiful waters the last thing the authorities want is news that a shark has killed somebody. When I girl disappears at sea it is first assumed she just drowned but when her body is found the Island's new Police Chief, Martin Brody, wants to close the beaches but the mayor is determined to keep them open and pressures the local doctor to certify that she was killed by a boat a second death, just off a crowded beach, causes a major panic and the mother of the victim offers a three thousand dollar reward to whoever catches the shark. This attracts everybody with a boat but doesn't impress local fisherman Quint, who demands $10,000, or shark expert Matt Hooper, who Brody invited to the island. After further deaths Brody, Quint and Hooper set of in Quint's boat, the Orca, to hunt down the great white shark that has been terrorising the island.

17,25 November 2021,sean-ramsden,9, A masterful classic that still lives up to this day!,"The first summer blockbuster, the big breakthrough for Spielberg, and the shoot that ended up tripling its schedule! Jaws is a monster of a film that changed not only the moviemaking world but also the beach-goer's confidence. It is as though we are born with the knowledge of this movie. As a very young child I genuinely believed the Jaws 'Dun...Dun' always played before a real life shark attack was about to take place, I hadn't even seen the film! Something said constantly about this movie is that the terror comes from not showing the shark but from simply suggesting it. Where and when is the shark going to pop up next? This was an idea that Spielberg developed mostly due to the issues with the repeatedly breaking mechanical shark but taken also from the master of suspense himself, Hitchcock. ""There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it"".",/
18,15 November 2019,acedj,9, What to say?,"What can be said about this movie that has not been said a thousand times already. This is the movie that started the shark attack genre of films and 44 years later is still the best of them all. It is by pure happenstance that the wonderful suspense that build through the film by not seeing the shark is actually a direct fault of problems with the mechanical beast they made, affectionately called Bruce (This being an Easter egg for the name of the great white in Finding Nemo). And suspense does build, not because you are not aware that it is the shark killing people, but because unlike many of the films that came along in this genre, it is not in you face. It is a subtle threat and you can sympathize with the people that are being hunted. The cinematography here is phenomenal, as is the acting. This is one of Richard Dreyfus's best roles. This is a long, slow story that back in the 70's was scary as hell, but to a more desensitized group of movie watchers will still be good, but without a lot of the scare factor. This is one of my must see before you die movies.",?
19,26 June 1999,baumer,10, The best film ever made.,"I saw this film when I was about 8 years old.  And what I remember most about it, is thinking that I had found the most frightening film that I had ever seen.  When I asked my parents if there really was a Jaws and they reassured me there wasn't, I still thought they were lying ( and they were, he does exist, I'm sure of it ).  To this day, almost 20 years later, I am still frightened to go swimming.  I have been to the Caribbean twice in my life.  Once to the Bahamas with my high school graduating class and once to Acapulco for March Break.  Neither time did my classmates or friends venture into the water because of me.  "" Did yo know that most shark attacks happen in three feet of water of less? "" I asked them.  Needless to say the hotel pool was well utilized on both trips.",r

23,7 November 2019,RhapsodyReviews,9, Classic Film.,"Review:
'Jaws' is a thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg. It is based on the novel of the same name by Peter Benchley.
Even for the time it came out this movie is still entertaining as hell. It's not the most realistic take on a shark, but it tells a revenge story that keeps you engaged.
In the film, a giant great white shark attacks beachgoer at a New England summer resort town, prompting police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a professional shark hunter (Robert Shaw).
You can't say anything bad about the acting in this movie, especially from the main cast. I was surprised by that given the age of the film. There are only a select few films that I consider both classics and to have good acting.
Spielberg brilliantly took what could have been a cheesy movie and turned it into a classic that will never be forgotten. Between the acting, directing and the amazing score, this movie is one to be talked about for years to come still.
Overall, this is yet another master craft from one of the greatest filmmakers out there. Nobody can walk away from watching this movie thinking it could have been better.

24,14 October 2017,Amthermandes,10, The Epitome of Suspense,"No movie can beat the brilliance of ""Jaws"" within the world of suspense and horror. Some movies have come close, others have even matched it and gone on as legends themselves. But none have, or ever will, surpass this Spielberg masterpiece.",t
25,28 March 2021,bsideleau-62176,10, Modern filmmakers need to take cues from Jaws,"Watching Jaws today, the film has just as much impact as it did back in 1975. Why? Because, rather than relying on special effects, the film relies on characters, dialogue and atmosphere. The shark's presence is always felt, even though it is rarely seen. However, what you remember most from this film are the characters. The interaction on the boat between the three leads is cinema perfection. The filmmakers of today have lost their way in a sea of weightless CGI and meaningless noise. A true masterpiece ""monster movie"" begins with good characters and atmosphere, the effects are merely the icing on the cake.",t
26,8 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, Still the greatest 'underwater menace' movie,"Twenty-five years after it was first released, Spielberg's timeless classic still hasn't aged a day and retains that chilling suspense and tension which first propelled it into the limelight in the first place. A masterpiece in fear and terror, this is an expertly-crafted film (everything about it is just right: the pacing, the story, the acting, the cinematography) packed with believable, realistic characters who you know and care about, and plenty of nail-biting moments and scares. It also boasts an incredible last fifty minutes, which is basically a cat and mouse game between Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw and the Great White itself.",_
27,26 June 2020,andymac-46665,10, You're gonna need a bigger boat,"45 years later, this film still has the power to entertain.
Loved this film since I was a kid.
Flawless acting, direction and production values.
Even the big rubber shark has some appeal.
My Nan used to say, they don't make em like that anymore. With Jaws she was right",u
28,2 December 2019,theknownames,10, An engrossing cinematic experience,"Jaws has stood the test of time. Another brilliant soundtrack by the legendary John Williams. And while Speilburg wishes he never made this film because of it's effects on shark killing (not to mention people's fear of the water) his movie changed the course of history. The principal photography rewrite coupled with Bill Butlers cinematography create a palpable window into vacationing in cape Cod where it's been discovered, 50 years later, that there are indeed great white sharks are hunting in the Atlantic Ocean just off of cape cod shores in MA.. A prophetic premise coupled with the vivid chrome color palette - and I still hear the echoes of Spanish lady while sitting in traffic as I head towards my own great America summer vacation.",r

30,2 January 2021,AngelHonesty,10, Never Gets Old,"Talk about a movie! I will always love this film no matter how much time passes. No one has been able to make a better shark movie since Jaws. The death scenes still give me chills as you can imagine a shark ripping a person apart. The suspense is kept up perfectly throughout the entire film as you encourage Brody to find away to kill this shark attacking people. I loved the way the movie was filmed, with great acting and good lines it turned it into a masterpiece. The only downfall in the entire movie is how they drag out the end, but still worth the watch!",
31,26 June 2012,Hey_Sweden,10," ""This was not a boat accident!""","*The* original, classic man vs. nature thriller that ushered in the era of the ""summer blockbuster"", ""Jaws"" remains vivid, believable, and highly effective, more than 40 years after it was first released. Everything about it is memorable, from its set pieces to its shocks to its cast to its music to a young Steven Spielbergs' masterful direction, and these elements can thrill even the viewer who's seen them before. Any summer season simply wouldn't be complete without a viewing of it. The story is straightforward and compelling; the screenplay (final credit is given to author Peter Benchley and screenwriter / actor Carl Gottlieb, who plays newspaperman Meadows) trims the melodramatic fat from the Benchley novel and goes right for the thrills, which come frequently.",
32,24 January 2022,safenoe,10, Scary,"I saw Jaws on the small screen but still definitely scary for sure. Jaws was the inspiration for Sharknado for sure, and the score by John Williams lives on forever. It's hard to believe Steven Spielberg made 1941 just four years later.",

35,15 March 2023,cataldocraze,10, One of the best,"Simply one of the best movies I've ever seen. Start to finish- it's near impossible to find fault in this movie. Peak Spielberg, directing a perfectly written script, perfectly acted by a talented cast with almost impenetrably good special effects captured flawlessly by the cinematographer and crew. That's without even considering John Williams' amazing soundtrack. A nearly perfect film. It starts, happens, and ends without the viewer even being aware that it's happening. And then you realize that that you just watched a timeless classic of a film that I'm confident will endure as long as people are sane because of it's overall quality. There are literally no faults with this movie. A top 5 all time for me.",

37,11 October 2004,OriginalMovieBuff21,10, One of the greatest blockbusters ever made!,"Jaws is one of the best films ever made and probably one of the greates blockbusters also. The dialouge for this movie is excellent and my favorite actor in this film, Robert Shaw, is so memorable and timeless. The shark scenes were so creepy and brilliant it just can't ever be missed. The scariest scene throughout the whole film is the scene where they go scuba diving and see a man's head that pops out from a fisherman boat. That was totally freaky and got me goosebumps. There were no flaws in this movie except some corny acting but still it was 1975 film and the 70's films have the best movies anyways. I highly recommend this film if your a big shark fan. Also keep out of waters!",
38,17 February 2022,LukeCoolHand,10, Perfection,"Want to see a perfect movie ? Well here it is. Perfect casting, perfect pacing, great plot, right amount of humor, wonderful dialogue, and just about the best if not the best movie ever put on film. I loved it the first tine I saw it at the theater in 1975 and I still love it today. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and especially Robert Shaw are perfectly cast - cannot think of any other actors that may have been better, Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton were great too. There is not a minute of wasted time in this movie - all scenes are top shelf. The only other movies in my opinion I would call perfect are Deliverance and The Thing 1982. There are a lot of great movies I love besides these 3 but they all have at least one thing in them I'd change - Not Jaws.",
39,10 March 2004,TruPretender,10, An instant classic!,"When I first saw the film, ""Jaws"" I was immediately frightened by the unseen terror that pulls the human psychosis to the depths of the ocean...literally! Steven Spielberg had made himself the most successful director of all time when he went all out with this one! Running to the back of the house and turning all the lights on were just a few things I resorted to after watching the opening for the first time!!! I Never watched anymore of it until 1-3 years later. I was highly hesitant because to a young child, a skinny dippers suffering to the wrath of the giant unknown mouth was the most horrifying sequence in film history at the time...and it still is now! Once I finally got the courage to view the film, I was still in for a lot of surprises. The cinematography is superb in its ruthless attempt to bring the audience to the depths of a powerful ocean, and to the eyes of the dark, wretched creature the inhabits it. The story of the killer shark attacking the unfortunate island in the world is more than scary. It could have been any place in the world, and it had to be Amitty Island. The shark could have easily lost it's way in the swaying currents of the ocean, but as the opposite inhabitants of the beach get angry, this big mother is here to stay! The technique is wild, absolutely wild, and John Williams score earned more than an Oscar for it! Creepy piano notes enter this films titles, and the blue depths of the uncharted territory beneath the sea let us all know that no sense, however small, was to be spared. The first victim, alone will haunt those who view it for the rest of their days, and the rest of the story is more like a battle. This strange battle is often more focused on understanding the other side. What Brody, Quint, and Hooper must do is plunge into the depths themselves, and seek out the unruly monster of the sea. The common theme in this terrific classic is survival, and why not? Survival is a natural instinct to all animal alike. The shark must survive, as it makes so clear by snagging unsuspecting swimmers, but also the people, they to have to survive, but the island is not big enough for both man and fish together. Always a joy to experience over and over again, this film is the ultimate scare show to end them all! Sometimes, a lot of us fans can not seem to get enough of this instant classic!",

41,4 July 2016,heisenberg12,10, The true definition of a classic movie,"Jaws is a movie you can see one hundred times and it never gets old or fails to entertain in the way it had its first time. In fact, you love it more and more with each view. There is movie magic in this film that is almost divine. It almost feels like an artist throwing everything up against the wall and miraculously the material forms itself into some kind of vintage masterpiece. Where the movie really sets itself apart from the rest is in the final third, where it breaks all horror conventions by somehow formulating an iconic interaction of the three contrasting characters, all likable: Hooper, Quint, and Brody. The scenes the three of these have together are some kind of an ideal in filmmaking- they're raw, improvised, and each actor completely takes control of their characters in a way that makes the contrast feel even more real. It makes for great scenes, effective drama, and every moviegoer's favorite- memorable, quotable lines and dialogue. Shaw not receiving at least a nomination might be one of the top three biggest snubs in Academy Award history. His two iconic monologues, especially the Indianapolis, are among the most memorable in movie history. In fact, he not only should have been nominated, but he probably should have won. A classic movie, more rare than ever before in recent decades, is one you can watch over and over and never get bored or tired of it. It entertains constantly and finds a special place in your heart. It contains some sort of magic, perhaps with Jaws it is originality or just that raw, risk-taking filmmaking that just sticks, and you just can't seem to change the channel whenever it's on. It withstands the test of time and dozens of views. That is a rarity.",
42,10 May 2023,Mymoviediscography,9, Just watched Jaws and my heart is still racing!,Spielberg's classic thriller is a masterclass in suspense and terror. The film builds up tension in the most unexpected moments and takes you on a thrilling ride from start to finish.,
43,24 March 2021,evans-j34,10, The film that terrified you of even going in a swimming pool,"Watching this film as a 80s kid terrified me ever more of the sea ( even though I love to snorkel now my heart still races and I look around in fear 😅) my mum had the book which is just a great a read and true to the film, even the front cover of the book was so chilling. This film keeps you on edge of your seat the opening sequence so frightening I would never swim in the dark, but even the boy on the float ( blood splitting out everywhere )was just as terrifying, tbh I was shocked to learn decades later this film was only a PG as not only is it truly frightening it is gory, a mean a man gets are in half, another leg. No1 whowver saw this film growing up ever looked at water the same again and will have had nightmares no shark films even come close to this original, reading other comments now that the mechanical shark looked fake I honestly dont remember it doing I always remember it looking very real to me, certainly better than all the CGI cr@p 1s we get now",

45,7 March 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10, This movie is the reason why I am afraid to go in the sea now,"I do admit that the story is rather silly initially, but essentially this is a captivating, well made and scary film. Full to the brim with brilliant dialogue, strong performances from Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss, tension, suspense and Spielberg's excellent direction this really is a must see. Jaws itself is really terrifying, but even more so was the truly haunting score from John Williams. If you think the shower scene motif, played very high on the violins from Psycho is scary, and it is, I am still traumatised from watching that scene, or in the wolf's french horn theme in Prokoviev's Peter and the Wolf, the great white shark theme played by the basses in this film is even scarier, it never fails to give me goosebumps. Technically this film can't be faulted either. Overall, a must see, and is most likely to have you biting your nails. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
46,31 October 2001,Sylviastel,10, My Favorite Spielberg Film of All Time,"I love Jaws and I still go in the ocean even though I've seen this movie about a hundred times. I love watching JAWs. It's probably Spielberg's best film to date, sorry Schindler's List, E.T., and Saving Private Ryan. This movie does not leave you with any bad feelings. The movie is first entertaining from beginning to end and it is well-done. I love Roy Scheider in his role as the water phobic police chief, Lorraine Gary as his wife, Murray Hamilton who I always mistake for Hal Holbrook as the Mayor of Amity, Robert Shaw as the shark hunter, and Richard Dreyfuss as the shark expert. Anyway, there are great moments in the film like when Chief Brody catches his young son imitating him at the dining room table and asks him for kiss and Mrs. Brody watching with a cup in hand. It's those moments of pure magic that make you want to watch over and over again.",
47,27 September 2005,Theo Robertson,9, Spielberg's Best Movie,"There's something terrifying about open water that has etched itself upon the human psyche .

We can't see , hear or smell what's under the waves and we can't breathe in water either and anything that can has got one over on us . Why do you think there's been so many legends about sea monsters ? And the success of JAWS is entirely down to the way that it exploits mans fear of the sea ",

At the time it was the biggest box office hit in the world and for its budget, it was quite an achievement. It still isn't without problems.

The story is simple, straightforward yet profoundly powerful, with outstanding performances by every member of the cast. This is the kind of movie that Hollywood no longer makes, CAN no longer make and no longer wants to make. It's a movie with a story, devoid of any computerized special effects, depending entirely on the actors to bring the script to life. This movie is so effective that it has become an cinematic icon. The images from this movie have been incorporated into American culture. The impact of this movie on the public has been profound, enduring and unquestionable. Roy Scheider gives one of the great performances. Robert Shaw's performance is equally powerful. They are the stars of this special movie, but the entire cast is excellent. Bravo to Jaws.",

After more attacks, he, a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss), and the owner of a boat (Robert Shaw) set out to destroy the shark. The shark is not even really seen for over an hour into the film, making the concept of a shark rather than the shark the source of the horror, a sense of brilliance not found in most horror movies. Also, the film revolves more around the characters and the decisions they must make to deal with the situation, which really brings about a more interesting aspect of the film. Audiences don't want a film to dwell on the horrifying objects that can't communicate; they want to expand on characters and people. That's what makes this such a great film. It's intense, a bit scary, and has little bits of humor throughout that make it fun to watch. The ending proves to be a bit too intense for me, so I don't feel it's absolutely perfect, but very close.",

58,23 September 2001,WehoSteve,10, Not your average fish story...,"Widely regarded as the film that began the ""summer movie blockbuster era"", JAWS (1975) was also rightfully one of the year's most critically acclaimed movies. It was also the recipient of an Academy Award Nomination for Best Picture and a winner of Oscars for film editing (Verna Fields) and music score (John Williams).  One of the reasons the film received no acting nods is that everyone involved is so good, how could one single out just one or two? (I personally feel Robert Shaw should have gotten a Best Actor nomination, however). Roy Scheider is wonderful as New York cop Martin Brody, who has relocated to a small coastal island town, only to have his bad case of ""aquaphobia"" put to the ultimate test. Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly cast as a shark expert and provides some truly funny comic bits along the way. Lorraine Gary (who director Steven Spielberg says was the first person to be cast for the film) does an excellent job of being the concerned wife and mother. Finally, there's Murray Hamilton, who gives one of the best performances of his career as Mayor Vaughn, who seems to be more concerned about the economy of the town than the safety of the residents. In a way, Vaughn is really the film's villain. Solid cast indeed. The screenplay (by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb) is tight and well-written, as is Spielberg's direction. Whether it was the mechanical shark's failure to operate correctly or Spielberg's decision to simply see less of the shark until the end of the film, the ""less is more"" idea works perfectly, particularly in the opening scene, which is chilling to this day.",

66,25 November 2008,thinker1691,9," "" You're Gonna Need a Bigger Boat ""","According to his own recollection, novelist Peter Benchley stated he considered his story involving a huge shark attacking beach swimmers several years before the movie. When the book came out, Steven Spielberg first thought it would make for a good scary movie. That was before he became aware of all the technical problems involved. At one point he hated the project and anything having to do with it. To his credit, he finished the difficult film and it became a true Classic in it's own right. The actual story is based on the 1916 account of New Jersey beach goers being attacked and devoured by a real life shark. It is no surprise, when you see the film ""Jaws"" be prepared for some unexpected shock scenes. There are several which if you're seeing it in the dark room, at night or alone, you'll find yourself seeking company, comfort or a large weapon. To my way of thinking, it is the actors who imbue the film with such artistic reality, they cause audiences to re-consider going swimming in the ocean. Spielberg did an excellent job in finding Roy Scheider to play, land loving Police Chief Martin Brody. Robert Shaw is superb as Quint and his ' USS Indianapolis story' makes for mental horror. Youthful newcomer Richard Dreyfuss is excellent as Matt Hooper, the 'professional' shark expert. Murray Hamilton plays the fiscally stubborn Mayor Larry Vaughn. Together the cast add their personal signature to this incredible film and place it on the shelves of the finest movies ever made. ****",

Jaws is about a shark, a man eating shark, a very simple topic, but it is perfectly executed. The shark itself is not shown until the very end (Spielberg intelligently uses the Hitchcock suspense technique there) and John Williams' brilliant score delivers all the scares.

It was also nominated for an Academy Award for ""Best Picture"" and while it didn't win on that particular night it later did win a Golden Globe award for ""Best Motion Picture-Drama"". Likewise, Richard Dreyfuss won a BAFTA award for his performance as the oceanographer named ""Matt Hooper"". And there were other awards and nominations as well. In all it was quite impressive. Now, as far as the movie is concerned, this is definitely one that I can recommend to all but the very young and faint-hearted. Although there isn't much gore, graphic language or nudity it still has enough drama and suspense to keep a person's interest throughout most of the movie. Personally, while I thought the special effects were more than adequate for that specific time period, I still would have preferred a bit more gore to make it seem even more realistic. Additionally, I thought some of the film got a bit bogged down by the dialogue-especially while the three main characters, ""Sheriff Brody"" (Roy Schieder), ""Captain Quint"" (Robert Shaw) and the aforementioned ""Matt Hooper"" were at sea waiting for the shark to appear. Even so this was a very good movie and as proof of that one need only look at the number of sequels, clones and similar movies which have been spawned (no pun intended) due to it.

70,3 September 2021,nickenchuggets,9," ""You're gonna need a bigger boat""","Being one of the most well known movies of all time, Jaws has had a profound influence on popular culture, filmmaking, and even how people regard sharks. A legacy this movie left behind that is not always considered positive is how it portrays sharks, specifically great whites, as unstoppable killing machines who live only to eat people. It's true that the great white specifically is the type of shark that is responsible for more attacks on humans than any other, but it is still an incredibly rare occurrence. Jaws was also the first movie to rake in over 100 million dollars, and demonstrated to everyone in the business how much money films could make when they were done right. Star Wars came two years later and would surpass its financial success though. Despite this, the movie remains one of the most iconic in history, and this has a lot to do with its presentation. The movie starts on a beach and shows how one day, a young woman is brutally killed and gutted by some mysterious killer while in the ocean. Some experts determine from an autopsy that a shark is responsible for the attack and get Brody (a police officer) to close the beach, but Larry Vaughn (the mayor) is convinced this decision cannot stand because income will grind to a halt. The decision to close the beach is temporarily undone until the shark strikes a second time, this time killing a young boy. Meanwhile, the people at the beach are growing more paranoid and want whatever is terrorizing the sea to be dealt with. A fisherman named Quint offers his services to mayor Vaughn and promises to kill the shark. Later, a tiger shark is killed which helps convince the public the danger has ended, but an oceanographer named Hooper doesn't believe the attacks were carried out by such a small animal. Shortly after, it is the fourth of july, and tourists are everywhere on the beach. The shark attacks yet again, ending the life of another person. Brody now decides enough is enough and sets out with Hooper and Quint on the latter's fishing boat to track the animal down once and for all. During this final confrontation with the nightmare of a shark, it displays almost human-like intelligence and makes a mockery of the men's attempts to kill it. That night, the shark smashes its bulk into the side of the boat, shutting its electricity. Quint goes borderline insane and prevents Brody calling for help from the coast guard, saying how he and he alone must kill the animal. The boat's engine then explodes after the shark floods its compartment, leaving the boat dead in the water. The boat slowly starts to capsize, and with time running out fast, Hooper attempts to stab the shark with a spear loaded with poison, but drops it in the ocean. The shark then eats Quint, which means Brody is the only survivor left. He climbs the ship's mast which is the only part of it still mostly above the water, and using a rifle, manages to shoot a tank of compressed air lodged in the animal's mouth. The huge explosion literally blows the shark's face off, and Hooper (who managed to survive the fight) reunites with Brody. Jaws is a film with quite a simple premise, but time and time again, simple movies are shown to be the best. The reason why the movie is still disturbing so many years later is because even though you're aware the shark is the main antagonist, getting a glimpse of it is rare. It hardly appears on screen, but you feel its presence as more and more people start getting mauled. Another interesting parallel this movie has is shared with the book Moby Dick, since Quint is pretty similar in character to Captain Ahab. Both are grizzled veterans of the high seas who are obsessed with killing a large beast, and both are eventually killed by their respective adversaries. Alongside The Exorcist, this is probably the only movie I can think of that remains disturbing even decades after you watch it. I'm sure many people no longer go in the water because of Jaws. The menacing music by John Williams also helps this movie's reputation greatly. It's not everyday where you see a movie so creepy that it stays with you years later. Overall, Jaws is a time proven, well written, and genuinely creepy movie that shows how sharks are one of the few animals in the ocean that are afraid of nothing. Not even humans.",

There's no wasting of time on this. The movie grabs you by the collar in just the first couple of minutes with the truly frightening first attack - made even more frightening by the fact that (although you know what it is) you never see the attacker.

There is something about him that is extremely like-able. My favorite part about the actual shark itself is that the robot couldn't sustain in the water and ended up breaking down. So they used the barrels to try and show where the shark is. It actually adds this element of mystery and horror that's extremely affective.

But when Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw) are on the ""Orca"", the shark pops up without warning; this prompts Brody to suggest getting a larger boat. There was also a good contrast between the two sailors and Brody: both Quint and Hooper had scars from being attacked by sharks, while hydrophobic Brody had no scars.

Shaw, who met with an untimely death three years later, is particularly memorable as the cantankerous Quint. Of course they are just supporting actors to the real star: Bruce the shark.

Jaws was a mega blockbuster at the time, becoming the highest grossing film at that point and changed the way Hollywood release and marketed movie. Both the film and the novel was inspired by the historic event of the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916. The movie starts out with the infamous scene of a moonlight skinner dipper getting drag under the ocean. In the morning, the town of Amity Island finds out that she was attacked by a shark attack. Police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) orders Amity's beaches closed, but is overruled by mayor Larry Vaughan (Murray Hamilton), fearing it would hurt the summer tourism on which the town's economy is heavily dependent on. When the deaths continue to pile up, Brody brings in ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) to kill the killer Great White Shark once and for all. Quint is larger than life and even cartoonish because the story needs this character. Quint is the ring leader for the great ""Boys"" adventure which is the turn this movie takes in the last third act of the movie and the best part. Quint, Brody, and Hooper. They laugh, they argue, they are tested, they bond, and it work. Robert Shaw does a great job in the role, and the whole USS Indianapolis speech was amazing. His overt bravado and Machismo was greatly needed to play counterpoint to Hooper's nebbishes. He is the story's Captain Ahab. It was one of the things they change from the novel. Another is cutting most of Benchley's many subplots, like Hooper having an affair with Brody's wife, which is great in my opinion. In my opinion, Richard Dreyfuss was the weakest of the three main characters. It was so unlike the character from the book. Still, Hooper should had the same ending as the novel. It was disappointing. I do like Roy Scheider as Brody. I love Roy Scheider's ad-lib of the line ""You're gonna need a bigger boat."". I just wish his fear of the open water was explain. It was generalized and non-specific to fit the expected fears of most of the audience. Brody is the everyman character so he must be most generalized, least brave throughout, least in control throughout. He does not become ""heroic"" until he is finally all alone and must do whatever he can to kill the beast, which he does the vicarious triumph of the audience through him. The film had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. Due to that, Spielberg rarely show the shark, until the third act. The shark instead is shown by camera point of view of the creature looming in the ocean or close shots of its fin. John Williams's orchestral theme, the creepiest since Herrmann's Psycho also plays a part. Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the animal's presence, employing an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances. The music gives it a pulsing heartbeat. It ramps up the tension from point to point and brings the film to higher and higher plateaus. Due to the lack of shark presence, so critics might say, this is the greatest B movie ever. I disagree. It's not a B movie. It's a movie that follows the same structure as B movies. B movies are not necessarily bad. They're cheap and they put the premise before character and plot development. The two things that separate Jaws from B movies are the deep characters and the insane budget. The writers cared so much for who the characters were that it could not be a B movie. I just recently saw the movie again and I am amazed how well it holds up. Spielberg was a master at showing his skill and awareness to story, setting and character. Then the art! There is a shot of Brody looking out the boat window while reflected in the glass is the yellow barrel being dragged out to sea by the monster shark. Brilliant! It is sublime in illustrating the magic and exhilaration of this great ""Boys"" adventure! The reason why Jaws works as a good horror movie is because who can deny it? Great White Sharks have killed people in the past, and aren't creatures of morality. Great white sharks are apex predators. Their physiology and whole lives even are centered around killing. Nature can be scary and brutal; why not show it as it really is? Great White Sharks, although they are indeed misunderstood creatures who don't outrightly kill people for pleasure or even sport like humans do. They have been known to kill people under the perception that they have mistaken swimmers as wounded prey. Hence their attraction to loud noise and splashing. They are indeed a force of nature, but as humanity has learned time and time again, nature is a dangerous thing, and great white sharks are some of the most deadly the ocean has to offer. Some people got offended because it portray sharks in a bad light and help cause some species of sharks to be nearly extinct due to hunting. New studies have shown that the danger great white sharks pose to humans is greatly exaggerated and I agree, they are dangerous, but it's rare to have shark attacks. What isn't exaggerated is how popular the movie got after the released. Its spawn horrible sequels, and a few Universal Studios rides. In the end, Jaws is a pretty good horror movie. Filled with terror and adventure, Jaws continues to make new generations of fans afraid to go swimming. Let Jaws take a bite out of you!",

94,25 January 2014,bkoganbing,9, A different skill to the hunt,"I've always had a theory of why Jaws is such a frightening film for so many people. It is because we are challenging the shark which maybe the most perfect killing and eating machine in nature in his own habitat. We are land creatures, we cannot breath in water, we can only hold our breath going under for a limited time. Even with scuba apparatus we are no match for the shark in the place where he lives and breathes.

I think we can skip the story except to say fish eats man, man finally kills fish. The fish was called Bruce, or was it Moby Bruce. Roy Scheider is the chief of police of a resort fishing village on an island. He's the local authority so often found in monster movies. Murray Hamilton is the superior who doesn't trust or believe Scheider. Richard Dreyfus is the requisite scientist -- often but not always a toothsome babe. In this case the expert can be a man because Scheider is already happily married, with children, as the first half of the movie establishes.

This is part of popular culture, with countless references to it and parodies of it in the almost 35 years that has passed. I suppose I will still describe the plot: A small island community finds itself terrorized by a shark. A really, really big one. The storytelling is good, and this never loses your attention. It's interesting to note that the limitations of the mechanical effect led to this being as excellent as it is. Not being able to show the animal all the time, Spielberg opted for build-up and character development, thus creating a marvelous suspenseful atmosphere as well as getting the audience properly invested in these characters. This is immensely exciting and intense, and you don't know exactly when something is going to happen. The acting is great, every single performance(with the possible exception of some of the kids, but that's nothing new). FX are better than you might expect, and the careful and precise editing and cinematography succeed in making them entirely convincing. The score is solid. This comes with an featurette that is almost two(in total, all of the stuff amounts to maybe three) hours long and worth watching, an interview with Spielberg, deleted scenes, Shark Facts, a minute and a half of unfunny outtakes and some galleries. There is frequent moderate to strong language, a little bloody violence and disturbing content. I recommend this to any fan of horror films and/or thrillers. 10/10",

Roy Shieder plays a sheriff of the town and Richard Dreyfuss plays a marine biologist of sorts.  There is great tension throughout the movie and some good comedy here and there as well. The shark attack scenes are pretty good too, especially the one when you see the shark go for the one guy after the kids boat is tipped over.  The first part of the movie is the town, and the second is the boat scenes and them tracking the shark.

All the shark killings in the first hour of Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" have the same mentality of the slasher movies that became vogue sometime in the late '70s. But this is what sold tickets--and made Peter Benchley's source novel a huge bestseller--yet the carnage isn't so much scary as it is depressing, and Spielberg displays no remorse for the victims (he's too anxious to show severed limbs). Police chief Roy Scheider, scientist Richard Dreyfuss and bounty hunter Robert Shaw sail out to capture the shark, and the machismo and male-camaraderie turn the film into something headier: a character study with art-film flourishes (and indeed, some of those shots from the fishing vessel are beautifully done). It's a gripping, compelling film without being a lot of fun. Dreyfuss' brainy nerd gets laughs, though his nonchalant sarcasm is overplayed (and his final act re-emergence is a crowd-pleasing though dunderheaded move); Scheider is a terrific Everyman who isn't afraid to sink into the background; and Shaw is dead-on in his bloodthirsty portrayal of a hunter obsessed. **1/2 from ****",

In late 60's a new group of directors emerged to fill the vacuum. Their influences were other films. They were the movie brats. And the only one of them to achieve sustained unbroken success was Steven Spielberg. He is the most commercially successful filmmaker of all time, with an unerring instinct for the modern mainstream. He has converted his filmmaking powers to unprecedented corporate power in Hollywood. But while his commercial success is indisputable he has suffered much criticism; chiefly that his films are childish in their viewpoint. He positions himself in the cosy Middle-American ideological mainstream and presented issues in morally simplistic terms. His movies were full of sentimentality, moral certainties and special effects wizardry. He made Schindler's List partly with a view to address the accusation that he was not a serious filmmaker.

139,7 February 2014,utgard14,10, Spielberg's Best,"What's there to say that hasn't been said in praise of this great film? Spielberg's classic about a great white shark terrorizing the small community of Amity Island. It's an effective powerhouse thriller with terrific direction and an iconic score by John Williams. It's based off of Peter Benchley's terrible novel. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw give the performances of their careers. Let's not forget the underrated Murray Hamilton as the Mayor. He brings sympathy to a part that most would have played as a straight-up mustache-twirling heavy. Despite all the variations and ripoffs through the years, Jaws hasn't been matched. That's because it's not just a movie about a killer shark. It's a movie about people. All of the imitators seem to forget that and just try to make a movie about a shark or bear or fill-in-the-blank-animal killing as many people as possible in gruesome ways. Today's CGI-addicted filmmakers could learn a thing or ten about storytelling from Jaws. It's definitely a classic and, in my opinion, easily Steven Spielberg's best film.",

At first I thought it would be in Califorina thats where all the great whites are located, WRONG! A sleepy New England town would have to be the place to be. I would know it would be a fact that sharks would be one of the most feared killer animals we would ever have. I would thought alligators would be the top one. Steven Spielberg has made a success with this movie, it was not only filled with depth, but also intrigue, wonder, and of course horror. It seems that the great white has given a bad rep for its ferocity, but it's our own fear that really does that. In order to give the respects of the shark it to understand them like snakes, the non-poisonous ones, this idea wouldn't get so twisted. However, there has been shark attacks in the past, and this movie is just another scare factor just to keep us out of the water. What a cast, what a hit, this movie was definitely a blockbuster hit, and I would say anything that movie is not a keeper. And that's no fish story. 5 stars!",

One of the most successful and terrifying American classics that single-handedly coined the phrase ""blockbuster"" and did for swimming what ""Psycho"" did for taking a shower. Picturesque summer resort community Amity Beach is suddenly turned into a great white shark's feeding buffet with only source of reason Sheriff Martin Brody (Scheider) wanting to close down the beach prior to the profitable Fourth of July with the aid of shark scientist Matt Hooper (Dreyfuss) and salty shark hunter Quint (Shaw) on one of cinema's most memorable journeys into fear. Masterfully directed by a young punk named Steven Spielberg in his big-screen sophomoric turn helming the first of many successes in Hollywood. Based on Peter Benchley's (who has a cameo as a TV reporter) best-seller the storyline hooks you from its horrifying opening moments to its breath-taking finale of pure adrenalined, visceral terror. Oscar-winning and memorable soundtrack (""dumdumdumdum"") by John Williams and production design Academy Award recipient for its genuinely scary and realistic shark nicknamed ""Bruce"" by the film's crew after Spielberg's lawyer.

147,26 July 2018,Foreverisacastironmess123,10, Scared of sharks? Probably a safe bet that it's this classic's fault!,"There's a good reason that for years after its release, some were still afraid to go into the water. Jaws, what a Titan of a horror thriller! While the sequels may have got increasingly stupid and poor, the original was always one of those great classics that you really feel like you grew up with and had a special place for, and that was and still is so well deserved to this day, because it holds up so tremendously well. It was the first movie ever to cross the hundred million dollar mark and its hand in creating the summer blockbuster pretty much means that its influence on contemporary cinema cannot be overstated. Something that's so great about the movie's appeal and the craftsmanship put into it is its continued ability to thrill and terrify audiences despite having few overt appearances of the Great White shark, which also work amazingly well because the result is actually much scarier than if the mechanical shark had worked well enough for it to be shown throughout the whole movie. Young Spielberg knew just how to use that shark sparingly but effectively, using the iconic score, shadows, camera angles, and mostly just the acting chops of a fine cast to raise the tension and menace of the lurking aquatic predator to nightmarish levels. The keen focus on the characters and their story and interactions heightens the shark as a deadly force of nature. The infamous opening scene remains incredibly chilling, not least because of the disturbing performance of the beautiful young naked lady but also because it's a case of what we're not seeing being more shocking than what we do. One of the most deeply gripping and suspenseful moments in the film comes not from action, but from dialogue. RIP Robert Shaw, you sir gave one of the all-time great horror movie monologues! Thrilling, scary, atmospheric and cinematic, it inspired many animal attack movie imitators at the time but none of them really ever held a candle to it, and while there may have been one of two good examples over the years, the only truly great killer shark movie and great/granddaddy of them all remains Jaws, it's the best one of all time.

154,6 July 2017,a_chinn,10, Greatest nature-gone-wild film of all-time!,"Steven Spielberg's classic film about a giant shark terrorizing a small New England resort community is masterful entertainment and also (along with ""Star Wars"") ushered in the age of the blockbuster film, essentially ending major studio support of smaller edgier films of the 1960s and 70s. I recently listened to an interview with Roger Corman, the prolific low budget exploration filmmaker, who noted that after he saw ""Jaws"" he said to himself that he's in trouble because the majors figured out what he'd know for years, in terms of what audiences wanted to see, and did it much better. An argument could pretty easily be made that this is the greatest nature-gone- wild movie ever made. ""Jaws"" truly is a great film, but when most of it's competition was the the likes of ""Frogs"" (about a deadly hoards of frogs) or ""Them"" (about giant radioactive ants) or ""Night of the Lepus"" (about giant killer rabbits), it shouldn't be much of a surprise ""Jaws"" wins out (okay, Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" is a pretty excellent nature-gone-wild film, but ""Jaws"" is still better). But back to ""Jaws,"" this is the film that put Spielberg on the map. Up to this point he'd mostly done television and had one film under his belt, the fine ""Sugarland Express,"" but ""Jaws"" is a popcorn movie of the first order. Roy Scheider is the Chief of Police for the sleepy beach community of Amity Island when he's confronted with a likely shark attack at the outset of tourist season. Murray Hamilton is great in a supporting role as the mayor who won't let Chief Brody shut down the beaches, that is until a horrific attack in front of legions of beachgoers. At that point Brody is authorized to enlist the help of young shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and crusty shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw). Brody, Hooper, and Quint are a wonderful trio of contrasts aboard Quint's ship as they hunt the giant great white shark.

The movie would soon find more success on home video as being the first major movie to come out on laserdisc, and on TV airings where there was additional footage while being edited for tv. Three sequels as well as numerous video games and merchandise soon followed, as well as a memorable soundtrack that has been made fun of numerous times. This was Spielberg's first big hit, and the term blockbuster was coined as this movie came out in June of 1975 backed by a major tv ad campaign that didn't show the shark in real footage except at the very end with the poster and the film's rating, which could be pg-13 if it were remade today.",

159,2 March 2008,sharkattack1978,10, Jaws still lurks in the waters,"This is the mother of all shark movies. Still standing the test of time since it was made, Jaws is a solid gold classic. I have had this on video and DVD many times now, but every time i see it on TV I always end up watching it. It is a film that has universal appeal (no pun intended). By now everyone should know the story a killer Great White Shark is chowing down on the small town inhabitants of the peaceful Amity and the Police Chief Martin Brody must find a way to stop it. Right from those terrifying (Spielberg found the tune silly when John Williams played it for him, later it would become the theme that would strike fear into film-goers hearts and still do to this day) opening scenes with THAT music immediately instills the fear into you. To tell the truth i have never been swimming in any sea since i saw this movie, purely because like its depicted in this film, you don't know whats under you. This is a gem of a film as it still has the power that it had many years ago and still terrifies the new generation. Spielberg did a wonderful job capturing the magic of Benchley's novel. A lot of people slag off the ending even benchley didn't like the way that Spielberg scripted the shark dying. I say think about this without that scene Scheider would never have had the opportunity to say that great line ""smile you son of a....."" If you haven't seen Jaws then where the hell have you been, you have missed a great film. The shark breaking down during the film was great because then Spielberg gave us the POV of the shark as it's about to attack. If he had of had the shark to begin with it probably would have never worked, thank god he didn't. There's something about the view of the shark that more scary than seeing the shark. Maybe it's cause you know it's going to kill someone, or it could be the fact that Spielberg makes the audience think that for brief moments WE are the shark. The film should have got an Oscar for not only Editing (which it did) but for Roy Scheider for best actor, Richard Dreyfuss as Supporting Actor and Spielberg as best Director because it deserves it. When you do finally see Jaws, you do jump and if the shark had been seen earlier, i believe that, the scene on the boat would have lost it's shock value. All in all Jaws boasts some great performances from all the key players and yes even to ""Bruce"". This is also the only Jaws film where the shark was believable and not rubber looking like the sequels. I'm not so sure that it would still work if a CGI was integrated into the film or if they do a remake, the power is behind the eyes and thats exactly where i should stay.",

Wielding with likable performances by a cast of Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss, and the larger-than-life Robert Shaw, as groundbreaking suspense too powerful to ignore; this summer flick not only stole the position of the first summer blockbuster in the cinematic world, but defined the very career of Steven Spielberg. Shot in 1974, the production of the film dragged Spielberg through a journey of tribulations involving his newly inventive special effects that no filmmaker in Hollywood used before. Most notably was the 24-foot mechanic shark that failed to work throughout which resulted in minimal showings of the shark on screen. Ironically, it made for better suspense and better thrills (and plenty of gore) to leave audiences at the edge-of-their-seats. The film follows Roy Schneider as Sheriff Martin Brody who moves his family to the beautiful Amity Island, home of a highly tourized beach that soon becomes a place of nightmares when a hungry Great White Shark makes his way near shore and eats one of the tourists alive.

It brought about the advent of the summer movie season, it paved the future for blockbusters, it skyrocketed the career of a genius director in the form of Steven Spielberg, and of course this happens to be a damn good thriller. It is one of my favorite all-time movies and despite seeing this film multiple times, I always find watching the movie to be a wondrous experience. Steven Spielberg is considered by many to be one of best movie directors of all-time, and I wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. Time after time, he creates movies that exhibit joy, happiness, and the most of all-magic. Even his lesser films have a hint of magic to them. Each and every single thing the guy makes is pure art. 1975's Jaws is just the beginning of his storied career. Now the production of the movie was often troubled, but the result was incredible. Spielberg often recalls that he thought he would never make a movie again because of his not-so-secret production issues. The film was over-budget, the screenplay was being written simultaneously with filming, the cast and crew were becoming tired and worn out, the mechanical shark they were using kept on breaking, and Spielberg was just a director whose lack of experience and his heavy ego made things even more complicated. But luckily, Spielberg persevered in creating a very fun, terror-inducing movie.",

170,7 May 2005,Coventry,9, Slightly overrated...but definitely a trend-setter!,"""Jaws"" is a tense, intelligent and compelling adventure that still counts as Steven Spielberg's second best film, after his downright brilliant debut ""Duel"". Nonetheless, apart from the terrific idea to introduce a ""creature of nature"" as an invincible nemesis, this movie lacks a few essential aspects to be labeled masterpiece, in my humble opinion. That, of course, doesn't mean that it isn't a must-see film! ""Jaws"" is an exhilarating movie-experience and also an excellent reminder that Spielberg used to make gripping films for adult audiences, rather than dull and childish epics with an overuse of sentiment. The clever screenplay (mostly written by Peter Benchley) neatly divides this film into two parts. The first part is really splendid, with the quiet island community of Amity slowly growing aware of the fact that they've got a serious water-problem on their hands. The first (and severely mutilated) bodies of shark-attack victims begin to wash ashore but the obnoxious mayor initially refuses to acknowledge the problem out of fear tourists will stay away during the summer-opening weekend. This first half is very suspenseful (the opening on the tunes of John Williams' world-famous score!!), the camera-work is exquisite and there's some nice hillbilly-humor in the script. The second half has three specialists going out to sea in order to hunt down and kill the great white shark. Police chief Brody (Scheider), independent sea-hunter Quint (Shaw) and oceanographer Hooper (Dreyfuss) play cat and mouse on open water with an impressive monster they yet don't properly know the enormous proportions of (hence the classic quote ""You're gonna need a bigger boat"" when Brody first beholds the shark). Personally, I think this second part is a bit overlong and overall not as involving as the first. However, the character-drawing of our 3 heroes is brilliant and Shaw's ""Indianapolis""-monologue is still very chilling (it took three additional scriptwriters to perfection this legendary speech). The film's climax is very bloody and therefore a rewarding ending.",

175,19 May 2006,johno-21,10, And a leisurely ocean dip would never be the same,"I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release and was impressed. I had not read the novel but in 1974 Peter Benchley's book Jaws spent most of the year on the best seller list and the film's producers approached the young Steven Spielberg to direct. He was known for the big made for movie hit Duel and had recent success with his first theatrical released film Sugarland Express so he was given the monumental challenge to adapt for the screen a runaway best selling thriller for a summer release. Summer releases were usually relegated to Drive-In movies back in 1975 but because of the film's subject they took a chance on coinciding with the swimming and summer tourist season for maximum effect. The chance of a summer release of a major theatrical release and the use of a relatively unknown director was a big hit. Major summer releases became the norm and Spielberg became a legend. Spielberg would of course go on to direct such major films as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark and it's two big Indiana Jones sequels, ET, The Color Purple, the Empire of the Sun, Jurasick Park, Shindlers List and Saving Private Ryan among his big hits. He stumbled with a few misses too but the Spielberg name on any film draws interest and anticipation. Peter Benchley wrote the screenplay of his own novel along with Carl Gotlieb and some contribution from Spielberg. The monologue of the story of the Indianpolis tragedy was drafted by playwright Howard Sackler and screenwriter/director John Milius. One of filmdom's most memorable and effective music scores by John Williams received an Academy Award, one of three the film won including Best Sound and Best Film Editing. It was also nominated for Best Picture but lost to One flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It also was nominated for four Golden Globe Awards, winning one and got seven BAFTA nominations, winning one. Cinematographer Bill Butler had been a second unit photographer on The godfather, Deliverance and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and had been the cinematographer of The Conversation. He only filmed a handful of successful films after Jaws including Biloxi Blues, Stripes and Grease and it's odd that his career nosedived and he was involved with a ton of real bad movies. It's also odd that with the success of Jaw Spielberg never used him again in any of his films. Rexford Metz was the underwater cinematographer. It's basically a simple story of a giant Great White shark who has developed a taste for humans and had began prowling the sea shore of a resort town. It's possesses almost supernatural strength and cunning and the town's police chief wants to stop it but the town's mayor doesn't want tourists to know they have a shark problem. The cop enlists the aid of a young oceanographer, fresh out of college and a WWII Navy veteran who has become a seafaring bounty hunter. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfus and Murray Hamilton star. It's a well done suspenseful drama, well written with shock, horror and a little comedy too. I would give it a 10.",

The simple, pleasurable act that virtually defines summertime - going swimming at the beach - would never be the same again. And also, the audience love affair with a new, young, talented director by the name of Spielberg spanned into a marriage that lasted for both better and worse, over the course of damn near forty years!

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",

In all honesty, I used to watch Jaws 1 through Revenge regularly on TV in my childhood (I remember staying up really late for USA Network marathons and being scared out of my wits  thank God for commercials!), and I wouldn't have been able to tell you that the original Jaws was the definitive, and only worthy Jaws movie at the time. Seriously, Jaws 3D was just as thrilling (and I didn't even know it was supposed to be in 3D!), and I vividly recall, having seen the first three of them several times, how excited I was when Jaws: The Revenge first appeared on TV (I was probably around 10). I wonder if I would have been happier had I remained just as ignorant. Hmm Anyhow, I'm not, and, damn it, I can tell you that Steven Spielberg's Jaws is one of the single most amazing feats of film-making ever. It's just astounding how ingrained some of these images are in my head. And just how chilling the film remains after 30+ years. There is one moment that I wish I had forgotten, just so that I could experience it again for the first time: when Roy Scheider is shoveling chum into the water, facing the camera, and the shark jumps out of the water to catch some. This is the first time in the film that the monster appears without his trademark John Williams score (arguably the most well known score in the history of movies), and it's just a jump-out-of-your-skin moment. But, of course, I was expecting it to come, so I didn't exactly jump out of my skin. However, one moment I did forget made me do that: when Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, giving the film's best performance) is pulling the shark teeth out of the hull of the boat and that corpse pops out. Cheap scare, definitely, but, man, was I ever wound up just for the fact that he chose to check that boat out in the water! There's a little to complain about, mostly the completely ridiculous behavior of the animal. It begins to act completely unnaturally, seeking revenge, when, no matter how large it may be, any animal's going to flee that kind of onslaught. I doubt a shark is even this smart, but that creature, at best, would assume that the boat itself was the danger, and since the boat is much bigger than it, it would swim the hell away. At least it's not like Jaws: The Revenge, where the shark, the offspring of the original shark from Jaws, swims to (what would be uninhabitable) Caribbean waters to take its revenge on Roy Scheider's son! This was definitely one of the best theatrical experiences I've ever had. A ball and a half!",

It's this restraint that allows 'Jaws (1975)' to hold up as well as it does, with the stellar score combining with brief glimpses of the beast to tick us over until a woman is whisked beneath the waves or an unsuspecting swimmer's blood bubbles to the surface and by the time the animatronic actually pops up in full, we fully believe it because we're immersed into the world and invested in the characters that occupy it. It's a roller-coaster ride that fills you with every emotion on the spectrum, one that's impeccably crafted despite all its behind-the-scenes chaos, and the fact it can take its time to include a harrowing war story but still end on the explosive, frankly quite silly, note it does is actually rather commendable since it does all of it so utterly successfully. 8/10",

It's probably a good thing that the shark didn't work half the time, since in certain parts it doesn't look that convincing. Apart from that, what makes Jaws so much fun to watch over and over again is the amount of time that Spielberg invests with his three main characters. One of the best sequences is the second attack.  Brody slowly starts moving toward the pond, but his panic increases and he explodes into a full run. Pushing this along is John Williams' score that will forever be implanted in your mind.  The film reaches a palm sweating climax as the three shark hunters pursue, and get pursued by the shark.  Great movie that spawned three inferior sequels.",
215,1 December 2012,thesar-2,10, The Great Bite,"Just a quick note on Steven Spielberg's Masterpiece Jaws: Everything works. Yes, the whole background story on the movie came out years ago, their mechanical shark kept sinking, etc, but as for the final product: (let me repeat) everything worked. Score, acting, dialogue, suspense, realism, plot development, urgency, you name it. I have read the book, and of course there were changes – anyone yet comment on the missing love affair between Brody's wife and Hooper? – but, all novels change from page to screen. What Spielberg did was amazing. He didn't create a horror movie. Nor a shark movie. It was a movie concerning a small town 100% reliant on tourism and if anything goes against that, whether economy, weather, bad publicity or in this case, shark attacks, the town could go under. I never labeled this movie as a horror or monster movie. To me, it was an adventure and a suspense movie reliant on one man, an outsider, to battle something that will destroy both the local economy but also the islanders themselves. You get rich history and depth from the Mayor, Ellen Brody, Hooper, (especially) Quint and of course, Chief Brody. Heck, the whole town's inhabitants are rich in character. Honestly, skip the sequels. As a kid, I loved Jaws 2, but as an adult, watching all 4 (so far) films, only the original Jaws was worth watching.",

226,13 March 2014,barryrd,8, Classic man-beast struggle,"I first saw Jaws in 1975 and found it one of the most thrilling movies I'd ever seen. It became one of the most parodied movies of the 1900's because of the use of a huge mechanical shark that was more funny than terrifying. I can honestly say, however, that the movie still is great entertainment. I think it panders to our innate fear of what is unseen and lurks under the surface of the water. In fact, the glimpses of the fin and the outline of the creature under the water were more effective than the closeups of that huge, fake mouth. In the movie, the small resort town in Maine is the victim of the ocean monster which pops up in its major tourist attraction, its ocean playground. Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfus were just starting to make their mark and both excelled in Jaws. Director Stephen Spielberg went on to create many more great productions. Robert Shaw's performance as shark hunter Quint is memorable as the character who has a love-hate relationship with killer sharks. The movie is about a small resort town terrorized by the 25 foot shark at the start of the summer tourist season. The sudden crisis pits police officer Brody, played by Scheider, against the town mayor (played by Murray Hamilton) and the local merchants. The first attack takes place unexpectedly in the dead of night. The police chief is unable to get authorization to shut down the beach and the death toll mounts. The audience is gripped with tension every time the camera zooms in on the swimmers. In his quest to hunt and kill the shark, Scheider is aided by the erratic and foolhardy Quint (Shaw) and Hooper (Dreyfus), a trained shark expert who is often at odds with Quint. The incredible size of the shark stuns both Hooper and Quint but the challenge raises their resolve to fight and the two men become comrades in their fight against the beast. Scheider marshals the talents of Quint and Hooper and draws on his own substantial reserve of courage. What follows is a classic man vs. beast struggle. At one point we get some comic relief on the boat as Quint and Hooper compare battle scars, while drowning their fears in alcohol. Quint also tells a harrowing tale where sailors perish during the war in shark infested waters waiting for help. Note: Robert Shaw, who played the shark hunter, died only three years after the release of this move at age 51. He was a writer and an alumni of the British theatre scene, who also played in movies alongside Sean Connery and Richard Burton. Shaw lived a full life and as well as his career as an actor, he was married three times and had ten children.",

230,3 July 2015,matthewssilverhammer,10, As Great As Ever,"Summer, the most profitable time for multiplex theatres and CGI-explosions factories, has become synonymous with (arguably) soulless outings of artless money-making. With remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels, franchises, and cinematic universes taking over our local cinemas each mid-year, it's easy to forget that this whole business started with the troubled production of Jaws. Spielberg's coming-out party stands-out 40 years later as a timeless piece of pure capital-F Filmmaking that surpasses most, if not all, that it influenced. With spectacular characters and thrilling scares, it still makes audiences pause before getting in the water. The modern-day leviathan tale of a tourist town dependent on out-of-towners for their economy (sound familiar, Panama City?) terrorized by a giant shark on July 4th is celebrating its 40th year of keeping audiences dry. The zeitgeist moments are wonderful (jumping mechanical sharks, ""you're gonna need a bigger boat""), but those thrills are matched by the timelessly human characters and dialogue. Spielberg grounds the excitement in enough reality to keep us engaged, specifically in the three men at the center. Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw have incomparable chemistry, playing some of the most endearing individuals in movie history. Sure, the mechanics of the shark itself are somewhat antiquated but that's to be expected. I can only imagine what we will think of the effects in Jurassic World in 2055. The immutability of the personality in Jaws is what has kept us returning to it decade after decade. This Independence Day, celebrate your national freedom by enjoying one of the greatest popcorn films of all timejust make sure you go to the beach first.",
231,27 March 2012,billcr12,7, Classic thriller,"Amity Island in the northeast is popular tourist attraction for beach goers. In 1975, Jaws changed everything. A young woman goes missing during an ocean swim. She is found on shore and the medical examiner rules her cause of death as due to shark attack. Police chief Brody(Roy Schneider) wants to close the beach but is overruled by the mayor. Shortly thereafter, a boy is killed by the hungry creature and mommy dearest puts out a bounty for the sharp toothed murderer. This brings out a hoard of lunatics trying to win the money, without success. The town then hires a professional hunter, Quint(Robert Shaw), to exterminate the carnivores and bring peace to the community. Quint, sheriff Brody and a marine biologist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfus) hop a boat and team up for the great white shark hunt. The action is exciting without any of the present day cgi special effects. Good acting, a good story and Spielberg make Jaws worth it.",

I doubt that anyone reading this hasn't seen it but if you haven't, I'll keep the recommendation simple. For one, I still have problems with going into deep water at the beach because of this movie. Second, Robert Shaw delivers what can be called the greatest monologue of all time (which reportedly he delivered in a drunken state). Third, the score by John Williams. Fourth, there's just no reason to keep going. The only flaw that I can think of is that the shark looks kinda fake in one or two scenes but you know what? I'll take Bruce (the shark's nickname, named after Spielberg's lawyer) over anything that would be produced these days, i.e. a badly fitting, CGI monstrosity. The movie has aged more than well and deserves a place on everyone's top films of all time. I would love to continue telling you why I love this film but I don't think I need to.

246,29 October 2001,hippiegal,6," How good acting, editing, directing and music can overcome a silly script","It's a testament to Spielberg's talent that he could make a movie like Jaws into a revered classic. The plot is incredible silly. You have a ocean full of perfectly edible creatures. Yet the SUPER shark only munches on people from one particular beach in New England. Yeah,un-huh, sure.But guess what, it works. Spielberg wisely builds up the suspense. We know the shark is out there and hungry. Yet we have to use our imagination on just how scary the shark is. So the tension and suspence builds and builds as the movie progresses. The New England setting works effectively. The extras all look and act like normal people. Giving the movie a sense of believability that say a Flordia beach setting would lack. The acting is wonderful. Shaw,Scneider and Dreyfuss throw themselves completely into their roles. Even if the characters are rather one dimensional. You can almost feel their fear at the climax. John Williams music is tight, but effective. Usually when Williams scores a movie he practically has music for every scene. (Which most of the time is a good thing) But keeping it to a minimum it's builds the suspence. Recommend if nothing else so many cliches stem from this movie's success. That and Kevin Smith references it in almost all his films.",
247,23 September 2010,estebangonzalez10,10, The Fear of the Unseen,"¨What we are dealing with here is a perfect engine, an eating machine. It's really a miracle of evolution. All this machine does is swim and eat and make little sharks, and that's all.¨ Jaws marked a before and after in American Cinema; it became the first true Blockbuster movie and it has since influenced films for 35 years. Before Jaws came out, there weren't any summer movies (perhaps many critics regret this since summer movies aren't necessarily recognized for its artistic value), but this movie set the standard for what a summer movie should look like. Jaws also launched the career of Steven Spielberg as a director since he was largely unknown by the general public. So you may ask yourself what made this film such a success. There are a great amount of factors that I consider helped turn Peter Benchley's bestselling novel into such a terrific thriller. First of all John Williams's score is breathtaking. The suspense he created with a few notes that accompanied the shark's point of view with the camera where masterful. There was no need to see the terrible shark; the music alone built the fear in us. Sometimes we fear more what is unseen than what is actually seen, and in the case of the shark it was much scarier not knowing where it was going to come out from in the water. The shark tales and pictures we see of people who have been attacked by sharks throughout the beginning of the movie are sufficient enough. Spielberg has already inserted fear in our minds before we even have a chance to see the actual beast. This technique was one of the reasons the movie was so successful. Everyone remembers the speech about the sinking of the USS Indianapolis as one of the highlights of the film and that is because it worked just like a scary tale in the middle of a campfire in the woods works, because it takes the atmosphere and the context and plays with our imagination inserting fear into our minds.",
248,29 March 2018,lorcan-61881,10, One of my favourite horror films of all time!!,"Steven Spielberg is a brilliant director; he is literally what maked half of the 80's great with all of his amazing nostalgia filled movies including Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom, Jurassic Park, E.T, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and of course..Jaws. Jaws came out in 1975 and is now considered one of the greatest films of all time with it being the ninth highest grossing film of all time and there is a few reasons why it's a amazing film. I won't rehash the plot because you already know what it's about for God's sake; a man eating shark attacking Martha's Vineyard but the film is so good for many things. 1. The direction, the direction in this film is brillaintly done and probably some of the best ever in cinema to me, 2. It's too creepy too watch, for me, Jaws is too creepy to watch, it always has me turning away at the underwater scenes and 3. It has the scariest and most creepiest score ever, that shark theme will always stay with me like, forever. Jaws is a classic and one of my favourite horror films that if you have not, obviously, please watch it!",
249,17 March 2014,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,10, One of the finest films ever made,"I cannot think of anything I would change about this movie. The acting is first rate. Shaw, Dreyfuss, and Scheider are all exceptional, one of the best matching in any film. The screenplay is well written, following Peter Benchley's book fairly closely, but dropping a needless romantic subplot, instead focusing more on the shark itself. A funny scene with the three men sharing a laugh on the boat one night while comparing scars perfectly segues into Shaw's chilling monologue about the USS Indianapolis, in another of the film's best scenes. The film next shows us the book's climax, about a half an hour before the real ending of the film- it very successfully tricks the audience into thinking the end is near, but then pulls the rug out from under our feet, and adds another act of (exceptional) new material. It leaves the audience members who had read the book prior to seeing the film wondering ""That's how they killed the shark in the book, now what? Now what are they going to do to kill it?"" The screenplay follows the book's story closely, but adds enough quality material to keep it unpredictable, and keep the audience guessing how it could end. ",

The third item from my 8 titles that have earned a perfect scoring. It offers something more 'mainstream' than The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly in regards to content, characters, themes. The storytelling is simply excellent, with the character introspection and development of the three main guys... it is perfect.

251,13 July 2000,Brogan,10, Happy 25th to the scariest movie of all time!,"It's a miracle that it's been 25 years since this film has been released.  I unfortunate didn't get to see this in the theater (I was born a year later), but countless viewings on video, cable, television, laserdisc, and now DVD has made this my second favorite film of all time.  What's rather ironic, is that Steven Spielberg consider this film his ""nightmare"" not because it scares him, but because it was a nightmare to make. With ""Bruce"" (the mechanical shark) keep breaking down, Spielberg went over budget and schedule to complete this film. He might call it a nightmare, I call it a blessing in disguise. Because of not showing the beast until over a hour into the film, it's a Hitchock element that even Alfred himself would be proud of. And the characters, the timid and aquaphobic Amity police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider).  The scary, experienced, and strong-headed fishman Quint (Robert Shaw).  The excited, knowledgeable, and brave marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss).  The community concerned as well as economic minded town mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton).

253,26 February 2008,emperor_bender,10, The original summer horror,"This was always a great movie to me. I always see it on TV and I watch it every time I see it. This is one of those movies you cannot go without seeing at least once in your life, or even once a year. No matter how many times you watch it, it always has you on the edge of your seat. I remember being scared of going in the water for a week or 2 every time I watched this in the summer. It still give me chills every now and then. One reason could be that it was based off the book ""Close to Shore"" which was about a real series of shark attacks on the South Jersey Shore...which is where I live! This movie had a huge impact on me for the reason that the town of Amity is much like where I live and could very well be attacked by a shark. Well...aside from the solid story, we have an excellent cast. Roy Sheider plays the unforgettable, smart, paranoid Chief Martin Brody, who serves as a very good protagonist here. Robert Shaw plays a very grizzly, creepy Quint; who besides the shark, seems to be the Antagonist here. Richard Dreyfuss plays a very know-it-all, smart Hooper. The other actors were all great as well, not one can be replaced it seems. This movie deserves its place on the top 250. 10/10 Seems like a good score.",

259,27 June 2004,flicklover,10, This movie is responsible for my love of cinema!!!,"I can't think of a movie that I 've seen more times than Jaws. It has every element that I love in a movie. Sure by todays fx standards it may seem dated to some, but it is a masterpiece of suspense and adventure. Steven Spielberg has been lauded for his other movies, he has made more serious movies of late, but I think this is one of his best movies. It is now known to most movie fans that the making of this movie was a nightmare. Steven Spielberg found a way to create a great film out of what in someone else's hands would have been a B popcorn film. True, at it's core it is a B movie, a great white shark terrorizes a New England Island town, three men go out to sea and battle the shark etc... What is great about this movie is its characters. Roy Scheider is great a Chief Brody, a Sheriff of the town who happens to be afraid of going into the ocean. He is not a hot shot know it all cop, he is an average Joe, doing his job to protect the town. Richard Dreyfuss is great as Hooper, a rich kid marine biologist who befriends Brody in his struggle to convince the town that they have a shark problem. And yes there is Quint, played by Robert Shaw, probably one of the most memorable movie characters ever. He is a salty sailor with a particular loathing of sharks. The movie takes its time to develop its premise, it doesn't rush to the battle with man and shark. The other great thing is that it is never pretentious, Spielberg could have filled the movie with metaphors of man against nature and the deep meaning of it, but he doesn't bother with it, it's an adventure film in the end. Most movie goers have seen this film, and I've seen a countless times, I always enjoy the movie. Jaws is credited by some to be the first bona fide summer blockbuster, it may have been , but it is better than most summer movies that come out these days. Summer movies nowadays are more concerned about CGI effects than storytelling, Jaws may have been made in 1975, but it holds up as one of the great adventures of all time. It lets us get to know and care about the characters before it thrusts them into the adventure, that makes the movie more entertaining. Great performances ,Great Director, Great script, Great Music, GREAT FILM!!!",
260,20 June 2002,ilovedolby,10, INCREDIBLE FILM!!!!,"Wow!!! Easily one of Steven Spielburgh's best films of all, however, aren't all of his movies. Anyway, this is just wonderful. Spielburgh uses very little of the shark to create a fear, or tension in the viewers mind. We don't see much of the shark, but the fear of it is heart pounding. I couldn't believe it. A few years ago, I was flipping through the tv channels and came across JAWS being shown for it millionth time. I decided to give it a chance considering I had never watched it before then. Luckily, I came across the part of Cheif Brody (Roy Scheider) chumming, and complaining about doing it. Then, out of nowhere the sharks head comes out of the water to collect some of the chum. My heart stopped for a few seconds, and I turned white. I was absolutly terrified. I feel the blood tingling in my arms as I watched the scene unravel. Absolutly terrifying! Not only that, the story of the USS Idianapolis by Quint (Robert Shaw) is enthralling. The performances by every actor in this film are supperb. The is a classic, and far supperior to DEEP BLUE SEA, or any of the other JAWS films. JAWS 2 is a good sequel, but ultimately, not as good as JAWS. Although, I would recommed seeing JAWS 2, because it is a good film, and it is scary. However, I didn't see JAWS 3, and I bought JAWS: The Revenge on dvd because it was dirt cheap.

Jaws is about a great white shark that terrorizes a summer resort in a small town called Amity. The police chief played by Roy Scheider, is determined to find out how to eliminate the shark after it's eaten one of the citizens of the town. Later in the film, a marine scientist, played by Richard Dreyfuss explains that the first victim in the movie, in the beginning of the film says that it wasn't no boating accident, it was a shark. Then, the Fourth of July comes up and the people of Amity are having a good time until the shark shows up. After the panic on the fourth of July, an grizzled fisherman, played Robert Shaw, plans to hunt the shark down and kill it. So, Dreyfuss, Scheider and Shaw team up to eliminate the shark. Director Steven Spielberg's has a great sort of suspense shots. Thought the shark is not seen the entire time, that is great because it is how Alfred Hitchcock directs suspense. It is what he calls playing with the audience like a piano. Jaws is one of the best films of 1975 and it's also one of my Top 10 best movies I seen. ★★★★ 4 stars.",

I'd never seen anything like it. It was breathtaking. For those who don't know, Jaws tells the tale of three men who set out on a perilous journey to try and stop a killer shark that has been terrorizing a small New England island. For the majority of the film, the shark is never seen. This builds up the tension until the big reveal. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss play the three men who set out to catch the shark, and they all give stellar performances. However, Shaw stands out the most. His speech about the USS Indianapolis is riveting, and each line he gives is perfectly delivered. The film also stars Lorraine Gary as Scheider's wife and the perfectly cast Murray Hamilton as the persistent Mayor Vaughn.

281,20 March 2008,HelloTexas11,9, the summer of '75,"Like 'Jurassic Park,' 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' and 'Star Wars', 'Jaws' was clearly the movie of the moment when it came out in the summer of '75, and it began a string of blockbusters by Steven Spielberg that pretty much continues to present day. All the familiar elements and themes that people love (and hate) about Spielberg are present, though some are more muted and underplayed than they would be in later films by the director. Perhaps he didn't feel he had as free a hand to indulge himself as he would later. As everyone on the planet has seen 'Jaws,' there's no point in recounting the plot. So instead, just a few observations. Roy Scheider died recently, and as almost inevitably happens, we tend to look at his performance a little differently now, with a touch of nostalgia and melancholy. He really was good in this, the Everyman we could all relate to. A decent guy in over his head, scared, not terribly intelligent but not stupid either, with the added ironic trait of being afraid of the water, and someone who ultimately becomes somewhat heroic, though not intentionally. He reacts the way we hope we would in a crisis where we're frightened out of our wits, but from somewhere inside ourselves we find the courage or fortitude or blind luck to do the right thing and save the day. Richard Dreyfuss has a star-making role as the shark expert Hooper. His character and performance are what date the movie more than anything; he has '70's yuppie written all over him and is the prototypical Spielberg male lead. Hooper embodies all the things that Spielberg seems to find so appealing: he is clever, funny, childish, emotive, silly, put-upon, but, like Scheider's Chief Brody, more resourceful than he gives himself credit for. Hooper is the man-child that inhabits so many of the director's movies (Dreyfuss would go on to star in 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'), and that most of the audience roots for and finds very entertaining. And Robert Shaw has the plum role, the scene-stealing turn as Quint, who is part Captain Ahab and part Popeye. In one of his best scenes, where the boat is being prepared for the shark hunt, Shaw keeps up a steady stream of seafaring prattle, almost gibberish, that is very funny and perfectly in character. Later, when he recounts his harrowing experience as a crewmember of the USS Indianapolis in World War II, and the desperate fear of floating helplessly in shark-infested waters waiting to be rescued, you can't take your eyes off him. (Spielberg says Shaw came up with much of the dialogue in this scene.) Quint has a kind of modified respect for Brody, but none for Hooper, whom he gives unholy hell all through the movie. 'Jaws' is one of those films that takes you back to wherever you were the first time you saw it. And for a couple of hours, it's 1975 all over again, right down to the leisure suits.",

He wants to shut down the beach and calls in a shark expert named Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) for help and Matt tells him that it was a shark but the mayor of the town tells him he cannot shut down the beach unless he has proof the beach is not safe.

The funny thing is that when Jaws came out and people were leaving the beach by the millions scientist's told us that a large shark like that would never come close to a public beach a 28 foot great white was caught 150 miles off the coast of long island.

298,9 July 2015,anaconda-40658,10, Shark!,"Jaws (1975): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Gary, Murray Hamilton: Triumphant masterpiece about that one creature that strikes fear into the depths of the ocean and the so-called safety of the shallow. A great white shark has attacked and killed a few locals at a small community of Amity, and the Sheriff sets out along with a biologist and a skilled fisherman to kill the creature. After a grand start with films such as Sugarland Express, director Steven Spielberg put his name on the map while tapping in on one of humanity's greatest animal fears. Roy Scheider is superb as Sheriff Brody who investigates the killings before having to force the resort to be shut down. He is afraid of water and that will be tested when he faces his finned rival to the finish. Robert Shaw plays the skilled yet over confident fisherman who demands a reward for the catch but his boast will be put to the test during a struggle for survival. Richard Dreyfuss steals scenes as a biologist who faces danger in a cage lowered into the water. Lorraine Gary plays Brody's supportive wife whose son suffers from shock. Murray Hamilton plays the stubborn Mayor who waits until tragedy before closing the area. The shark isn't seen until the second half but once it emerges we hear the famous line that visualizes how big the threat really is, ""We're going to need a bigger boat."" Score: 10 / 10",

300,15 November 2010,toqtaqiya2,10, Jaws became a cultural phenomenon and the first bona fide summer event film.,"Television had taught director Steven Spielberg to grab the audience in the opening sequence, but Duel (1971) had shown him that our fear of the unseen dictates that our direct confrontation with the giant shark should be delayed. Spielberg's brilliantly edited and scored film unfolds in three classically conceived acts. The film carefully balances suspense and humour, provides the police chief with a believable home life, creates credible characters in Brody (Roy Scheider) and Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and something controversially legendary in Quint (Robert Shaw). Several things give the film an extra dimension. First, the picture came out in the immediate aftermath of the Watergate scandal, the biggest cover-up and public deception in American political history, and playing the craven Mayor of Amity is Murray Hamilton, an actor associated with devious authority figures, most famously Mr. Robinson in The Graduate (1967). The second is the teaming of a uniformed policeman and a bearded hippie as the principled opponents of a dishonest community. The third factor, the one that gives true depth to Jaws, is the revelation that Quint was a survivor of the Indianapolis, the American warship torpedoed in July 1945 after delivering the A-bomb to be dropped on Hiroshima. As he eloquently recalls, nearly 800 sailors out of a crew of 1100 perished while clinging to wreckage, most killed by sharks. The thriller is many things: a high point in the 1970s group-jeopardy cycle; a Hitchcockian horror picture for the carriage trade; the massive box-office hit that established the reputation of Spielberg; and the film that created a new fashion for releasing films nationally with several thousand prints.",

""Jaws"" is adapted from Peter Benchley's suspenseful novel of the same name, and it tells the story of a great white shark searching for innocent prey on Amity Island, and it's up to the Chief of Police, a fisherman, and a oceanographer to help catch and kill the shark. ""Jaws"" is truly one of the many cinema masterpieces, and it's also one of the most thrilling movies ever to scare the life out of you. Steven Spielberg delivers an astounding job of directing such a suspenseful feature, besides all the trouble, or ""living hell"", that has been caused on set while filming. The cast is pure genius, and it's filled with such talented actors. The late great Roy Scheider brings a golden performance as Chief of Police Martin Brody, Robert Shaw delivers fine acting as Quint, the shark-killing fisherman, Richard Dreyfuss portrays an incredible performance as Matt Hooper, the oceanographer, and Murray Hamilton does a great job playing the mayor of Amity. Also, John William's fantastic score helped set the suspense, and it helped raise the tension. Bill Butler's astounding cinematography, Robert Mattey's incredible shark effects, Verna Fields' groundbreaking film editing, Ron and Valerie Taylor's astonishing shark footage, and the excellent use of sound helped create the world of ""Jaws"", and it brings a lot of art and hard work to the picture.

For most of the movie, Jaws is intense and keeps you on your seat anticipating what is going to happen next. The action scenes featuring the shark are wonderful to watch even though there is a little gore. However, there are a couple scenes that are boring. These scenes occur basically towards the middle of the movie. The music in this film definitely rockstarted John William's career. The shark melody is mesmerizing.

Review: When the film Jaws came out, the film became a massive hit and was highly praised by audiences and critics alike. Nowadays, it almost seems that Jaws is becoming under-appreciated and not taken a granted for. There's a lot to like about Jaws but it makes sense to start out at the beginning, when the lovely skinny dipping bombshell, happens to be the first victim to the ruthless sea beast. The panic in her eyes felt real and this kill immediately hooks the viewer into the movie. The music in this scene, by John Williams isn't necessarily catchy or explosive, but it's perfect for the underwater shark perspective, when approaching the swimmers. ",

328,28 April 2008,bobsgrock,9, True horror.,"For all the ""horror"" films that are released in Hollywood today, there really are none that can compare with Steven Spielberg's classic Jaws. Starting out as a pure horror tale about a killer shark terrorizing swimmers on the New England coast, it coasts through until we come face to face with the man-eating machine itself. The cast is terrific with Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfuss all giving one of the best performances in each of their distinguished careers. The real star, of course, is the shark, and Spielberg does a marvelous job of maintaining the suspense despite not seeing the shark at first. The film does have minor flaws, as it bogs down a little with too much footage of the shark hunt before quickly trying to cover back and make a strong finish, which it does. Nevertheless, this is true horror at its finest. It isn't particularly graphic, but some fantastic direction combined with John William's immortal score makes this one of the best films of the 1970s, of Spielberg's career, and of American cinema.",
329,11 May 2023,H4wke,10, Absolutely iconic,"The last time I saw Jaws, I was far too young. My grandma bought me the DVD at the mall next to my piano lessons (and Jaws 2 but let's not talk about that) and the film was a favourite for me at the time. Since I was about 10 or 11 though, I haven't rewatched it. I think the fingernails on the blackboard scared me off, that sound is absolutely hideous to me. It's a silly reason of course, but I always had it in my mind that 'I know Jaws is a good film, there's no pressing need to rewatch it'.",
330,15 March 1999,Truman-10,10, One Of The Best Movies Of All Time,"THE best movies are more than just a film - they are an experience. Just like watching Silence Of The Lambs, you  are right there with Clarice Starling as she hunts the killer around his house, and in The Truman Show you are in there with Truman wondering what's going on and looking for a way out. In Jaws, this is achieved better than any other film. You really ARE on that boat with Quint, Brody and Hooper as the shark menaces them. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the film is superb, but it's the legendary boat sequences at the end of the movie that makes this head and shoulders above every other horror film (even Psycho and Silence of The Lambs). The shear thrill and fear you feel every time the shark comes near the boat is incredible, and when it throws itself on board and tips the entire ship up, with Brody and Quint metres away from that huge mouth full of razor sharp teeth...well, it makes you hang onto your chair with both hands. The unbearably tense climax ..it's incredible. Spielberg puts you inside the movie, and it's awesome. Odd to think the novel (which is superb, but not as thrilling) ends with the shark just dying inches away from the helpless Brody. ] The true mark of this movie is the impact it has had - all around the World, people still look at the ocean and keep a weary eye out for black, dorsal fins cutting through the water....",
331,28 August 2000,pleiades10,10, Still a classic!,"The original ""Jaws"" is still a fantastic film, even by today's standards. It positively set the cinema world on it's ear upon it's release in 1975.",
332,28 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9, Jaws is the grandfather of the shark sub-genre.,"Some might say, it was one of the first major blockbusters to ever be released. The film that made audiences think twice about swimming in the sea. Being responsible for influencing many current directors working today. Is it worthy of the classic status? Absolutely. Ohhh yes ladies and gentlemen, Jaws is yet another classic in Spielberg's filmography that has every right to be called timeless. He didn't just create a horror film, he reinvigorated the genre! It's not what you see on screen that terrifies audiences, it's what you don't see. Casual holiday goers getting dragged into the hellish depths of the ocean as our infamous Great White shark rips them to shreds. The effectiveness of this, is that you don't see the shark in all its glory until the second half. Spielberg used the shark's point of view as a camera technique in order to create the scares, and it worked tremendously. Incredibly genius idea back in 1975. Accompanied by John Williams' famous ""Da Dun...Da Dunnn...Dun Dun Dun Dun"" (best way I can describe it) score, it was destined to be remembered for a long long time. What I also loved was the fact that it wasn't just a straight up ""shark is in the water, run away!"" type of film. There's a conflict of interest on Amity Island regarding tourism and wanting to keep the beaches open for income. Then the second half is where our chief of police and squad go shark hunting. So it is a varied film and I like how the narrative changes, it felt natural. Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss were great and pulled off some charismatic likeable performances. My one and only criticism, was that the pacing was inconsistent during the second half. The terror lowers and focusses on character development which did slow the film down for me. Having said that, Jaws is a classic and is worthy of all the praise that it gets. The first half is masterfully crafted and cements sharks as being Hollywood's greatest movie monster.",
333,14 August 2012,axlrhodes,10, Bruce almighty. Give me a mechanical shark over CGI any day.,"Much has been made over the years since Jaws first took the world by storm of the overall naffness of the mechanical shark, a.k.a Bruce. Watching it back in the year 2012, nearly forty years since it's release, it's amazing how good it actually looks. In a world overrun by computer generated jiggery pokery, seeing the raw ambition and physicality of an actual on location effect is an infinitely more rewarding experience than seeing some weightless digital manipulation which is an all too present feature of many modern mainstream blockbusters. Jaws is and always was far more than just a film about a giant shark terrorising a vibrant beach community. Based on Peter Benchley's bestseller, it owes a huge debt to Hitchcock in the way it implies threat and employs clever camera techniques to heighten tension. In collaboration with Benchley, Carl Gottlieb's superb screenplay is fleshed out beautifully with great performances including some wonderfully improvised moments that ground the film and give it surprising humanity. Richard Shaw's 'Quint', the stubborn old sea dog, Richard Dreyfuss' 'Hooper', the nerdy enthusiastic science puppy and Roy Scheider's 'Brody', the slightly neurotic worrier create a hugely likable trio that in the second half of the film come into their own in the hunt for the monster. A Jaws review without mention of John Williams' genius musical score is not a proper review. As with many other celebrated classics, Williams' music is the star of the film. With a few simple notes, Williams created something truly iconic that lives strong today in the vast subconsciousness of the world. I have nothing negative to say about Jaws, it still shocks, it still surprises and it'll forever be a classic piece of cinema from a talented director with the ability to use his influences to create his own brand of magic.",
334,30 December 2005,nixons_smelly_vagina,10, My Favorite Movie of All Time,"Jaws is, hands down, my favorite movie of all time. The reason for this is simple, I own Jaws, I have seen Jaws about 100 times, and still Jaws is the only movie that no matter how many times I see it; it still makes me feel the same as the first time I saw it. The directing and acting, in particular Robert Shaw, are flawless. I would argue that no movie has ever had the immediate horrific impact on a viewing public as much as Jaws. The film spurned a shark kill that has never, thank God, been duplicated. It was banned from sea-side communities on both the Atlantic and Pacific side of America. This movie made you afraid of something you did last summer. (no pun!) The chemistry that the cast had is something that I have never seen recreated. The whole Community of Amity, even the background players, flowed so natural I would believe Amity was a town I had visited as a child. If you have never seen this gem get on it now. 100 years from Jaws will still be a vital part of American cinema despite how many new movies may be ""more popular"". Jaws is forever.",

You didn't think the shark looked real, but you were still in suspense, weren't you? The fake-looking shark is a testament to Steven Spielberg's directing skills, because he still made Jaws into an intense and terrifying thriller.

It is what shaped my love for movies, and it has been an influence on me for most of my life, since I watched it. I've seen Jaws about seven or eight times. It is beautifully filmed, strongly acted, has a great story, and great direction from the astonishing Steven Spielberg. Last but not least, that great rubber shark that I just love. The film is from 1975 and had really no way to use CGI. So they masterfully used practical effects, though it was painstaking, and in the end it looked amazing. Robert Shaw's, Quint, Roy Scheider's, Chief Brody, Richard Dreyfuss's, Matt Hooper, John William's amazingly, suspenseful score, and the shark attacks, really did their job to make people not want to go back into the water.

349,5 April 2006,Hitchcoc,8, There must be something in the water!,"I think this is a very good movie. I don't think it's a great one. If one is going to have contemporary monster, you can go two routes. You can bring in the supernatural element and give it powers beyond those of mortal men (sorry Superman), or you can make it a natural danger, where it plays by the rules that nature sets up. This shark appears to have a personal agenda, and it's at that point, the move loses me a bit. Granted there are really fun performances by Shaw, Dreyfuss, and Scheider. They are such caricatures. The byplay between them works quite well. I did feel at times they did little to protect themselves and that was disappointing. You can be the soldier of fortune, but don't just walk in front of the cannon. There is suspense, and that shark is really frightening. What is done with the camera is the true star of the film. The shots of the swimmers' legs from under the water is true genius. And, of course, if you ever want to teach someone the importance of a musical score for a movie, you need go no farther. My kids gave me the anniversary edition of this for my birthday. I need to take a look at it again. It's certainly a formidable movie.",

351,7 August 2020,m-47826,9, A masterpiece.,"The plot is very simple. But the storytelling, music, script, directing, editing and so on give it texture. The way each characters are depicted, especially the main trio. That sums up the different types of « men ». The bachelor, the family man and the widower? Made the story more relatable and timeless. Even the shark, which is so monstrous, it makes you wonder if it is not Mother Nature herself sending it. To punish men, for their disrespect towards her. Or the Devil himself, dragging each sinners back to Hell. With the first victim, being a young ingenue, skinny dipping in the middle of the night. A cautionary tale? I think so. Nobody is spared by its wrath. And that's what is so great about this book adaptation. And something that won't be allowed these days, when we see movies like The Meg. Because it meant anything can happen, and it will. Even the death scenes are surprisingly tensed, and gory coming from the king of family adventures. Jaws is all that, and more. Even the humor is on point. And the actors do a terrific job bringing each lines and dialogues to life. And how about the special effects? Nothing to be ashamed of either. The shark works, and the fact that it didn't at first, is a blessing. It adds more suspense and anxiety, for that moment it will eventually leap out of the water. I stopped counting the number of times I've seen this movie. And whether your age, it is always seen in different degrees. Spielberg refused to cash in on the first movie success, by distancing himself from any sequels made in the future. And he clearly made the right call. As entertaining and fun (sometimes scary) they can be. The first one is, and will always be the best shark movie.",

I was absolutely fascinated and captivated.  That summer we went camping and at first I had no problems going into the ocean.  Nothing was going to keep me from swimming...and certainly no shark!   Well, that is until news spread that a guy had caught a shark while fishing from the pier.  Granted, it was just a baby shark, but that didn't matter to me.

Only Brody can truly succeed — Hooper will be forever changed by the experience, showing that his way can only take him so far. And Quint's the last of a dying breed who must simply die; when his survival is questioned, all Brody can do is say, ""Quint? No."" He can't survive. He is the sacrifice which enables the return to the surface of Hooper and Brody's one on a million shot that blows the shark to heaven.",

I'll usually think things like, well, those special effects, acting, plot,... were ridiculous, but they were awesome for that day and age. No need to do that here. Jaws is so good and universal, it could have easily been made today and be a hit. The fear of sharks, the agenda to keep a beach running for tourist money versus some vague allegations of a shark threat, the psychology, it still stands today. Not only did this movie catapult Spielberg to fame, it started a genre of its own (the shark movie), and was even responsible for the real-life shark phobia we still experience today.

Everyone knows of the behind the scenes conflict between Robert Shaw who played Quint, and Richard Dreyfuss who played Matt Hooper, this conflict translated into the film incredibly. Roy Scheider does an excellent job as chief Brody. In my opinion this is one of if not the best thriller of all time. The fact the shark isn't even on screen for the first hour of the film but we see what he can do and we fear him greatly. The music by John Williams makes the movie.

361,30 October 2002,popeyedoyle622,10, A VERY well done flick.,"This is a truly great movie. The idea that something so simple as a shark can terrorize an entire community and drive the citizens to such drastic measures is pure genius. For the JAWS guru, it's really about more than a shark that swims around and eats people; it is a perfect machine, too cunning in its natural instincts to make a decision between good and evil; in the shark's mind, there is only food. The fact that it can so easily outwit some of the most skilled men is fascinating and at the same time terrifying. Even without the plot, this is still a fantastic movie. The cinematography is excellent (anyone who remembers the head popping out of the boat can attest to that), and the use of camera angles instead of actually showing the shark (until the last few scenes) is a brilliant idea.The acting was one of the best uses of method acting since Bogey left the screen,which worked out quite well. One of the best examples of this can be seen in Robert Shaw's account of the sinking of the Indianapolis, which was mostly ad-libbed. Also, before JAWS, there were not any good movies (generally) that came out in the summer; JAWS was the first of the summer blockbusters, bringing in almost $260,000,000 in its first year. With its great plot, bang-up acting and terrific cinematography, this flick is definitly one of the essentials for any avid moviewatcher's repertoire.",

In fact it got SLOWER after they got onto the boat!  I was waiting for a lot of action scenes with the shark.  Instead I got Robert Shaw musing on his experiences as a hunter.  It wasn't a thriller so much as a meditation on the potential danger of a shark, and of trying to catch one.

My favorite parts were when Chief Brody (Roy Schieder) tells Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to tell a bunch of men who are going fishing to help get them out of the boat and if I remember right they said: Hooper-""Gentlemen, gentlemen, the officer asked me to tell you that you're overloading that boat"" One of the men- ""You ain't goin' man what do you care!"" Hooper-""Ok well then can you tell me if there's a good restaurant or hotel on the island"" One of the men- ""Yeah, you walk straight ahead"" Hooper-""He He He they're all gonna die"" Yeah I liked that part and the part where Quint dies. This movie has GREAT shark music and it's awfully scary for a crowd of people to go swimming when there is a shark in the water. This movie will teach you to never go in the water again!",

A pulpy novel adapted by a 28 year old near unknown director yielding one of the most infamously disastrous film shoots in the history of the medium (a duration of a projected 55 days exploding into 159, with a cantankerous cast, a mutinous crew and a barely functioning shark prop) - all things considered, the fact that the film was completed is a feat in itself. And yet, paradoxically for a film centering around a series of deaths, Jaws instead yielded a succession of figurative rebirths, being credited with singlehandedly pioneering the summer blockbuster and ancillary markets, terrifying and thrilling audiences worldwide and turning its amateur director into one of the most recognizable figures in the film industry - a certain Steven Spielberg.

As far as I know, Peter Benchley who penned the original novel never wrote a sequel, and Spielberg declined to direct Jaws II. Of course the answer is the producers and executives believed they would make even more money off the Jaws franchise, particularly among those who just could not get enough of the original. But as an artistic statement, this movie really doesn't warrant sequels as it covers just about everything you could possibly do with the subject. Aside from the shark killings themselves, the characters and the audience actually learn a little bit about sharks, there are political ""currents"" regarding whether or not to close the beaches, forces more interested in profits than safety are exposed, and there is even the lynching of a poor tiger shark which turned out to be a case of mistaken identity, i.e. he wasn't ""the shark"".

Jaws should have won best picture and Spielberg should have won best director because Jaws was better than any other movie made in 1975 by miles and than any other movie EVER made. In my opinion Spielberg should have won several Oscar's before he finally won it in 1993 for Schindler's list. ET should have won best picture and director and close encounters should have won some major Oscar's too. Also Indiana Jones and raiders of the lost ark and last crusade were better than any movie made the same year they were made, so he deserved some more credit than he got for those. Jaws has everything you need. It has three brilliant actors who do an excellent job, especially Robert Shaw, its scary, jumpy, tense, funny , edge of seat excitement, and believe me once you see it you will never feel the same going into the water again, ever.",

And then I learned that most people's reaction to ""Jaws"" was not admiration and respect for those wonderful creatures that sharks are, but fear and hatred! I was shocked - how could anyone hate sharks? I was sure everyone would realize how false the very idea of ""Jaws"" was, and understand that the movie is nothing but a 100% untrue, unrealistic fairy tale with horror elements - a modern Brothers Grimm equivalent! But obviously, many people believed it and as a result, supported the criminal idea of killing sharks. What a sick thing to do, I thought! Couldn't they separate the truth from the movie?

Let's face it, folks, ""Bruce"" or ""The Great White Turd"" as Steven Spielberg himself affectionately called him (and that's what it looked like when Brody shot him and he sank to the bottom of the ocean) made King Kong, Godzilla, Frankenstein, the Wolf Man et al look like wimps. Some of the macabre humor in this movie made you feel uneasy while you were laughing, eg., Mayor Vaughn's line ""I'm not going to have all these people standing around here while you do some half-assed autopsy on a fish."" As good as this movie, and the book is, I can't help thinking that this story is a rip-off of MOBY DICK, with Captain Quint being the Captain Ahab character with his obsession with capturing the shark, and in the ugly manner in which he died. Also, at least in the book, Chief Brody was the sole surviving Ishmael character (in the book, Matt Hooper gets eaten alive while he is in that shark cage).

Of course, the actual shark is fairly terrifying, but it's twice as scary when it just pulls people under the water, or pursues them with a torn off fishing dock stuck on its back (and how about the scene where the yellow barrels become so much scarrier than a dorsal fin). The killing of the little boy (a choice that Spielberg seems to me spending the rest of his career atoning for by having little kids get rescued in all his other movies) is an especially brilliant scene- writing, filming, acting and... oh God!... the pacing and timing!!! Excellent performances from all three of the leads and some of the supportings as well (Lorraine Gary... unsung brilliance sadly tarnished by later appearing in JAWS: THE REVENGE); Shaw's monologue about his pacific experience is one of the greatest movie speeches ever. The writing in general is excellent- they remembered to take the time to develop characters and such, rather than just move from one shark attack to the next- as is the filming (my favorite moment being the beginning, when there's a shot of the sun setting on the water, and you see Chrissie's arm and hand sink slowly beneath the surface).

""Jaws"" is my personal favourite of all of Spielberg's films, it has it all: humour, suspense, a great story, magnificent acting and, most importantly of all, it grabs your attention immediately and doesn't let go. The film is set in the small seaside resort of Amity, a  peaceful holiday town and to its residents, the summer means everything to their business. However, all is not well beneath the surface of the ocean, for a 25 foot great white shark has staked a claim in the waters.  It begins to pick off some of the townsfolk and the panic begins to spread.  Enter Police Chief Brody (a career-defining performance from Roy Schieder), who tries to close down the beaches to protect the people but is soon met with opposition from the Mayor (Murray Hamilton) who refuses to have them shut down for the 4th of July weekend.  As a compromise, Brody calls in an expert from the oceanographic institute, Matt Hooper (one of Richard Dreyfuss' early roles, and one of his best) who warns the mayor also of the dangers of allowing people into the water when a beast of such mammoth proportions is lurking below.  Predictably, disaster strikes and the mayor finally relents, allowing Brody to hire a contractor, someone to go out and kill the shark. The contractor comes in the form of an old sea dog in the mould of Captain Ahab,  namely Quint (Robert Shaw in fine form as usual) who has had several experiences with sharks on his many voyages.  He accepts the duty (""I'll find him for three, but I'll catch him and kill him for ten"") and so he, Brody and Hooper set out to hunt down the beast.

But I gave in and we went. I was sitting on the beach, watching as She swam out into the choppy waters. She rolled over, belly up, and started drifting toward a nearby pier. I was watching, not really interested, when something broke the surface of the water on the far side of my wife. It was a momentary thing, but I clearly saw the arched back- and the fin. I stood up and shouted a warning. She waved me off and continued to drift toward the pier. I followed, searching the surface of the ocean for another tell-tale sign of you-know-what. When she finally came ashore, I told her what I'd seen. She argued that I was just lying to scare her out of the water so we could go home. She went back into the water and I spent the rest of that day watching for the attack I was convinced would come. There was no attack- but, the very next day, not one but THREE sharks were hooked by fishermen fishing off of the pier toward which my wife had drifted.

That sounds like a devastating put-down, but I don't think Norman meant it as such. What he meant was that Spielberg borrowed themes from the cheap and cheerful science-fiction and adventure stories he had known in his youth and then gave those themes the full, glossy A-movie treatment. ""Jaws"" is a case in point. If a film on this subject had been made twenty (or even ten) years earlier it would probably have had some lurid title such as ""The Giant Killer Shark Horror"" and have been made on a very low budget with comically bad special effects. It would doubtless have disappeared from view almost completely, only surfacing for occasional late-night showings on specialist movie channels, probably on a double bill with something like ""The Blood Beast Terror"" or ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"".

Granted the Jaws theme John Williams composed has remained a classic in film score and depicted with aplomb the anxiety and terror of a large predatory shark closing in, and the scenes are decently directed and put together if you assess them with conventional mainstream movie criteria... but this is so far removed from actual shark phobia in any realistic, poignant sort of way and is so completely disinterested with it aside from the very first scene (possibly the only really creepy moment). It never even attempts to be realistic or genuine and only settles for that big production plastic Hollywood atmosphere and basically self-imposed itself as the one good shark movie out there that was legit (all other attempts being cheap B rated rubbish). It had John Williams for the score, Spielberg behind the cams, and Scheider/Robert Shaw and Dreyfuss, all well established big names, to give it the outside credibility it really is all about in the end.

I was11 years old when this film came out, and once we had convinced our parents to allow us to see it, it became the focus of our summer.  EVERY kid had to know everything about sharks.  EVERY kid wanted a shark poster, or toy, or tooth.  On top of that the movie was fantastic!  Gripping action, with actual people dealing with a near supernatural problem.  The look of the film is still incredible today.  The most lasting indication of how good this film was and is , is to compare it to its imitators.  Whether it is real drek like ORCA or more recent attempts like ""DEEP BLUE SEA"" these attempts at re-making JAWS have been very pale shadows of the nail biting original.",

I can't understand why Spielberg hates it so much...I realize that the filming was hell (trust me, I've read up on everything about this movie) but there 's such magic up there on the screen, esp. when Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw get together.  I could watch it over and over and know it by heart (my husband will occasionally come in and see in on TBS/TNT and say, ""Not again !"" before leaving the room in disgust).  Sure, Spielberg has gone on to bigger and better things (Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List) but nothing tops ""Jaws"" in my book!",

435,4 January 2013,wadechurton,9," Great movie, except for the shark...","Saw this again on TV last night and it still works; it's one of the great monster movies alright, but the only thing wrong with it is the monster. Oh, the vast majority of 'Jaws' is spot-on; Spielberg has correctly concentrated on the characters and not the situation. The mayor's grotesquely 'loud' jackets are just a little too obvious a labeling device but otherwise the town and its characters ring true, and we are swept along with these ordinary local folk as the plot develops. Robert Shaw's Quint has a few rather hammy scenery-chewing moments, and the actor does occasionally appear to have had himself a wee private party before filming some scenes. Still, he is supposed to be a local weirdo, and so his 'crusty old sea-dog' shtick isn't too much of a distraction. The changing relationships between the three men on the 'Orca' is another welcome subtlety often missing from horror movies. After establishing a supremely sinister presence throughout the movie, we must inevitably see the shark, and the more we do, the less we want to. The much-trumpeted animatronic creature doesn't really look alive, and even back in 1975 when audiences had no access to movies outside of a theatre, the moment when the 'shark' rears up out of the water and flops against the stern of the Orca looked absurdly like the attack of a colossal salami sausage. It's not a perfect movie, but 'Jaws' is most of the way there, and aspiring horror writers could do way worse than take a leaf or three from its meticulous care with the characters. After all, they are our stand-ins, and if we don't identify with them then horror turns to farce or worse still, tedium.",

Peter Jackson you were great as director of the Lord of the Ring trilogy and King Kong , would you have the inkling in doing a remake of the shark , I think you would be wonderful as the director , Steven Spielberg knew what he was doing , but he has to worry about the new Indy film out and how it is going to do against films like Speed Racer , but Jaws was perfection all the way , the remakes were laughable at best , the ones that came close to Jaws were not even Jaws related , they were The Beast and Open Water .

Steven Spielberg took the story of jaws made by peter benchley, and he made a blockbuster movie out of it. what does blockbuster mean? it was the first movie to gross over 100 million bucks, a title coveted by several directors. jaws held this title for two years, until George Lucas took the title, for the release of star wars.",

As great as it is though, it's not my favorite kind of film to review since its strengths (the shift from a comparably slower police procedural thriller in the first half to survival horror in the second half, the mayor's poor handling of the situation, Quint's USS Indianapolis monologue, several iconic shark scenes, the soundtrack), have already been analyzed to death, so when I discuss those aspects, I feel like I'm just repeating things that many other people have already said.

Spielberg dragged this film up by the scruff of the neck and made this film a classic. It was dogged by technical issues, budget problems and a massive lack of support from the studio. The crux of the film's success lies in the camaraderie between the main characters, most of which were 2nd, 3rd or 4th choices. One of my favourite scenes is where Brodie is brought back to reality by his son imitating him at his dining table. Beautiful. That is why the vast majority of Spielberg's films are so successful because he makes the characters so believable and vulnerable and so we care about them.",

The people on the beaches look just the same them, as they do now, and I could easily imagine myself there. The ""move along, everything is fine, no need to worry"" political mentality is also still very much alive and kicking. If I had to name my favourite bit, it would be where Quint and Hooper trade scars on board the Orca, in the darkness, while waiting for the shark to return. The acting, filming, direction and writing all come together to make it a truly remarkable moment.",
446,16 September 2022,gbill-74877,8," Well-made, but a problematic representation of sharks","Early on there are some interesting themes in Jaws: capitalism vs public safety, and mob mentality vs science and rationality. Ooh, don't you want to just punch that mayor for looking out for business concerns while letting people go to the beach after the first shark attack? It's almost an exercise in Darwinism when people return to the beach, and there's marvelous tension ala Hitchcock because we know the shark is out there, amplified by the classic soundtrack and the terrific feeling Spielberg gave us of being in the water. The film also a battle between working class experience (the crusty sea captain, Robert Shaw) vs college education (the oceanographer, Richard Dreyfuss), with the town's police chief stuck in between (Roy Scheider).",

Richard Dreyfuss gives, in my opinion, one of his best performances as the eager sharkoligist Hooper. Robert Shaw, is nothing short of mezmorizing as the salty old shark hunter Quint. As for the Shark....Well, I must say that it is a credit to Steven Spielbergs genius that he wisely choose to save showing the shark until the last act of the movie. Its really the ""Lack of what we see"" that is the most terrifying. John Williams score will be forever seared into our memories whenever we think of something ominously stalking in the ocean. I never grow tired of this movie and strongly recommend it to future generations. The effects may not have CGI, but ""Jaws"" proves that what we don't see is far more spooky than what we do see.",

But this film is the best popcorn movie of Steven Spielberg's illustrious career. At least in my opinion. Spielberg masterfully has blended suspense,horror,drama and at times humor into a spellbinding thriller. The best mainstream thriller since Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. The acting is excellent and not just from the three leads but the whole supporting cast. From Murray Hamilton as the disbelieving Mayor to the mother of the little boy on the raft who confronts Brody in a small but memorable scene. John Williams' Oscar-winning score is arguably the most famous of all time. The whole movie is loaded with classic scenes from the opening sequence where Chrissy meets her fate to Quint's horrifying story about the men on an ill-fated mission to deliver the bomb during World War II. Even though most scenes have been memorized by now, this film never fails to deliver. That is perhaps the truest test of any movie.",

Ever since I first saw Jaws as a child I've been fascinated with sharks and I'm so grateful for this film's existence because of it.

Hooper is out of his League Enter the film's most colourful and memorable character Quint wonderfully played by Robert Shaw If Brody is the town's Heart and conscience Hooper the young Hero Then Quint is the modern day Ahab who becomes obsessed with killing the shark for 10 thousand dollars. the three end up on Quint's Boat the Orca and Hunt the shark in the films most memorable moments The Highlight is when Quint tells us about his time on the ill-fated USS INDIANAPOLIS and the deaths of the crewmen after the ship sank. Robert Shaw delivers a chilling story that creates it's own moment in Jaws.

One Of The Best Musical Scores In Film History Also.,"1975's Jaws is now an immortalized classic after 25 years this film still brings suspense and fear to all beach lovers and swimmers. Jaws can be called a classic for many reasons to name a few the directing of Steven Spielberg the good acting of Richard Dreyfuss as a genius scientist studying and analyzing the Great White Shark and Roy Scheider's portrayal of a good-hearted cautious town sheriff(Martin Brody). Most of all the musical score at the films beginning and really throughout all of the film makes such a suspenseful climax that movie fans loved I remember owning the 45 record I wish I could now find the CD or tape soundtrack. Jaws is not really a horror film, but more a suspense-thriller that builds up to a horror climax. This film really had many people I know terrified to go swimming at the beach, because of the portrayal of a shark being a human-eating machine. Jaws is definitely one of the century's best movies a film to view many times for suspense lovers.",
469,6 January 2018,elijahbutler-40119,10, One of the GREATEST movies of ALL TIME!,"If you haven't seen this film yet, there's something wrong with you! I have talked to a lot of my friends and asked them if they have seen Jaws and 90% of my friends said NO! Jaws is a film that has inspired MANY movie makers and is known as the 1st blockbuster film and one of Steven Spielberg's BEST movies! Jaws was released in 1975 and was one of the first movies to make A LOT of money at the Box Office and it became a HUGE success and is STILL a fantastic movie to this day! Roy Scheider as chief Martin Brody is GREAT in this film and his character as well as other actors felt like they were playing as actual real life characters in life! I was also impressed by Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw's performances in this film! All of the characters in the film felt like ACTUAL characters that are dealing with actual problems in life and that's one of the reason's why Jaws still works as a masterpiece! And yes, there are people today that say that the shark in Jaws looks fake. However, to this day the animatronic for the shark STILL works! And the main reason is that Spielberg didn't show the shark for the majority of the film which builds up the scare factor and it makes the experience A LOT more suspenseful and they also used some scenes with ACTUAL shark footage in Australian waters! There are many things that make this movie successful, but I can't do a review of Jaws without mentioning John Williams! His score for Jaws is absolutely beautiful and not just the scenes where the shark appears, but also certain scenes that take place in Jaws and the score brings up the suspense in the film! I am really surprised on the special effects they used in this film and they still hold up well to this day! Jaws is definitely one of the GREATEST movies of all time and it's a masterpiece and a timeless classic and it has stood the test of time VERY successfully and it's a film that EVERYONE has to see at least once and Jaws DEFINITELY gets a 10/10!",

478,2 December 1998,Cress,10, A chilling account of what happens when a shark strikes,"I saw this movie on telly when I was quite young, and from then on it gave me an obsession with Steven Spielberg and sharks. Since then my obsessive nature with anything to do with sharks has died down, but I still love Spielberg and his work. This film started the whole summer blockbuster and along with it started the whole hook thing where the first few minutes of a film leave you hooked and wanting to see more. Those first few minutes had me on the edge of my seat with my heart pounding. I later found out it was so convincing, because Susan Backlinie who played the helpless victim Chrissie was being yanked too hard on her feet by the divers underneath and those were real grimaces of pain. Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw make a perfect trio and the film really starts to focus on these 3 characters and really starts to get thrilling as they leave land to kill the dreaded 25-footer. What follows is a fascinating portrayal of the 3 different ways these men handle what is before them. Roy Schneider's classic line 'You're gonna need a bigger boat' has been ripped off time and time again most recently with Godzilla 'We're gonna neeed bigger guns' A classic chilling film masterpiece from beginning to end. This does for water, namely oceans but large swimming pools can have the same effect what Psycho did for motels and showers.

After watching it for the first time today (via NetFlix). I saw it and I loved it. Hello and welcome to ""Matthew Praises."" Where I get to praise the heck out of something that is worth the watch. After 25 years of parodies (specifically in cartoons e.g. Mr. Jaw in THE PINK PANTHER SHOW). Now I finally saw it and boy it was like an answer to the question, ""What if Alfred Hitchcock made a monster movie?"" I like the way we get introduced to Quint. In the scene where the crowd is clamoring at the town meeting, we hear and then see, Quint's hand scratching the chalkboard slowly, and they all shut up. I was like, ""Whoa! That is so edgy."" No whistle or yell for attention. No. Just scratching nails on a chalkboard. That got spoofed in an episode of SOUTH PARK where Cartman did it when Randy Marsh was having a meeting. John Williams' score is catchy and scary. The mechanical effects are rather clunky by today's standards, but back then, it was awesome and realistic. If you want to make a horror film or learn about film making, then this is for you! Bottom line: It's edgy suspenseful and scary. Go on give it a watch, I highly recommend it.

Believe it or not, the audience does not even see the shark for the first 45 minutes or so of the film. Instead the use of a dorsal fin, barrels or a POV shot is used to determine the whereabouts of the shark throughout the film.

blonde, tanned, fit, big boobed naked girl goes for a swim, gets eaten by shark.
boy goes for a swim, gets eaten.
We can't have sharks eating away our children and hot girls!
When there's something strange in our neighborhood, who we gonna call? A cop, a marine biologist, and a fisherman!
Wait, what?!
The 3 dummies get on a crappy wooden boat to hunt a giant carnivorous shark. Oh, did I mention they were dummies already?
They keep shooting harpoons attached to a rope, attached to a plastic container filled with air, so that the shark will drag it and becomes slower and tired.
After they believe the shark to be tired, they tie the ropes to the boat. The sharks drags the boat backwards and makes some water go inside the boat, into the engine room, which damages the engine.
One of the dummies goes in a shark cage in the water to try to fight the shark or something. The shark sneak attacks the cage, making the dummy drop his weapon. Then he opens the cage, and the dummy is able to flee, and hide until the end of the movie.
The shark eats the fisherman. There's only one dummy left in the boat, and it's sinking. He makes the shark eat a tank filled with something explosive, than shoots at the explosive thing and the shark goes kablooey.
The end.

I could watch the dinner scene from the interaction with the young boy through to drinking wine, over and over.

If I had to guess why some wouldn't like it, I suppose it could be because Bruce doesn't match the live shark footage in the film. Or maybe people prefer a CGI shark?  I'm stumped.  See Deep Blue Sea if you want that, and you'll see that CGI sharks don't make a movie.  Besides, Bruce looks great in 90% of the shots, especially when he rises up under Brody during the last stand.

It had been a while since I had seen Jaws, but it seemed to be as terrifying as I remember.  Of course there are shots where the shark looks a little fake, but the camera angles used in most of the attack scenes, or false alarms are excellent.  It still is very creepy in some parts, very atmospheric - with the music, camera angles, pauses by the actors - it all comes together very nicely.  The story is not too bad either, especially when we forget the 3 inferior sequels.  Jaws is still the ultimate monster movie, even with films like lake Placid and Deep Blue Sea trying to reinvent the genre with comedy/horror, Jaws knocks them over anytime.  The casting of Jaws was really very well done, and all three actors- Dreyfuss, Shaw, Schneider seem to have a great chemistry between them- although this is not really seen until over half way through the film when they board the Orca.

514,17 October 2012,bayardhiler,10," ""You're Going To Need A Bigger Boat ""","An Understatement if there ever was one. ""Jaws"" (1975) is without a doubt, one of cinema's greatest achievements. Here you have what could easily be considered your standard B-movie material (not that there's anything wrong with that) that gets turned into a masterpiece by the one and only Steven Spielberg. The movie starts out innocent enough, a group of teenagers are hanging out on the beach, a young man and a girl decide to go off on their own. The girl wants to go swimming and the young man wants to accommodate her, however, he is clearly suffering under the effects of alcohol and doesn't make it into the water. Lucky for him, because shortly after the girl goes in, we, the audience, can clearly see that something is lurking under the surface and is getting closer and closer and then STRIKE, the girl is grabbed, whipped back and forward, pulled under again and again, and screaming for her life. In a few seconds, its all over as she is pulled down for the last time. From then on, we know that we're in for one hell of a ride. There are so many great things about this movie that I'm not even sure where to start. The acting is superb: there's the always reliable (and sadly, now deceased) Roy Scheider as Chief Brody and Richard Dreyfuss as the brilliant and sarcastic Hooper. However, the most brilliant performance may be that of the late, great Robert Shaw, who plays the hot-tempered but likable old fisherman Quint. Despite his enormous ego, you can't help loving him. In addition, there's Murray Hamilton who gives a great performance as a typical politician and Lorraine Gary in the role of the supportive chief's wife. The real star of the movie though, is the shark himself, who is created with a combination of real shark footage and a mechanical creation, which, while it may look a little fake in some scenes, still looks pretty scary after all these years. Filmed at the famous Martha's Vineyard, ""Jaws"" is a movie that revolutionized the film industry by creating the summer blockbuster and made people afraid to go into the water. Oh, and who can forget the iconic theme by John Williams, a theme that has become so embedded in pop culture that every time anyone hears it, they know what it is. To put it bluntly, you are robbing yourself by not seeing this monumental achievement.

526,4 August 2021,kevin_robbins,10, This is a classic American film that is entertaining to this day,"Jaws (1975) is currently available on Tubi. The storyline involves a small island near Cap Cod in Massachusetts that unexpectantly has a series of shark attacks just before July 4th weekend, their busiest revenue generating time of the year. When they catch a shark on the coast they feel it's safe to move forward with the festivities. The sheriff doesn't agree. When the sheriff is overruled by the mayor, what could go wrong? This movie is directed by Steven Spielberg (The Color Purple) and stars Roy Scheider (The French Connection), Robert Shaw (The Sting), Richard Dreyfuss (The Goodbye Girl), Murray Hamilton (The Gradiate) and Lorraine Gary (1941). The storyline for this is compelling with a constant battle of beliefs on what's happening to the community. The acting is excellent as Scheider battles his own conviction and perspectives throughout the film. The casting and soundtrack are both perfect. What really makes this film work is the underwater cinematography as well as the shots above the water looking down at the shark. The child dying on the floaty really starts the film off with the right feel and the July 4th beach scene is legendary. The camaraderie between the male cast members as they hunt the shark towards the end is awesome and the mechanical shark still looks great. Overall this is a classic American film that is entertaining to this day. This is an easy 10/10 for me I'd strongly recommend.",

Although not quite as brutally effective as his earlier 'Duel', 'Jaws' is still a fine, minimalist thriller based on a very simple idea (namely, ""big shark""), notable also for the absence of a single obvious hero (all three human protagonists have flaws). On the downside, John Williams' famous score is a little proscriptive at times, and although the shark is very frightening, the man versus shark fight is realised with only partial success: one never quite believes that all participants are in the same environment.

Steven Spielberg would go on to projects of greater artistic ambition (""Schindler's List,"" ""Saving Private Ryan"") and would enjoy the services of much more reliable and convincing special-effects monsters (although less convincing humans) when he brought dinosaurs to life in ""Jurassic Park,"" but has yet to make anything that's as perfect as ""Jaws,"" on its own terms, was and is. Visually dazzling, marvelously suspenseful, and blessed with more character development and depth than most popcorn flicks, this is one for the ages.",
546,15 September 2015,moviemattb,10, The Definitive Shark Movie,"After Steven Spielberg directing his TV movie ""Duel,"" and his first theatrical movie ""The Sugarland Express"" he would go on to direct a movie about a man-eating shark that attacks people. The movie is about a great white shark, that has been causing all the issue for attacking innocent people on Amity Island as our three main characters set out by sea to go find the shark, and kill it so no one would have anymore shark problems whatsoever. ""Jaws"" is a cinematic masterpiece of filmmaking, and I thought Spielberg is able to bring such tension of suspense and excitement as you are going along with the ride. The production of this movie had numerous problems to get the shark to work, but Spielberg made such a wise choice to not show the shark as learned from one his idols Alfred Hitchcock as he makes this movie very suspenseful as he did with ""Duel"" for not showing the truck driver. He only shows the shark toward the end of the movie, which it makes a very good build up to show the shark. Also, the movie works well with the human characters as they don't come out as cardboard cutouts, but make them as they act like real people. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss are excellent together in this movie, and they make a great chemistry. I have never read the book, but I'm sure that movie is different than what the book represents. Peter Benchley wrote the book, as well as co-writing the screenplay with Carl Gottlieb and the movie does have a very well written script. The shark itself is very well done for its mixture for using practical effects, and real-life shark footage by Ron and Valerie Taylor; this is before CG as they had to film a real shark so the filmmakers won't have to keep going practical with the shark. As for John Williams, his music is completely unforgettable and really loved the theme that he created for this movie; its a good thing that he won an Oscar for his music of the movie, and he really deserves that kind of recognition. The movie does go at a very good pace, and I thought the climax at the end between Brody and the shark is very well done. The opening scene, in my opinion, is really Spielberg's own shower scene from ""Psycho"" as it is shocking to see this poor woman get killed by our main antagonist. I'm not going into much detail about this movie because everyone has seen ""Jaws,"" and it will always continue to be a classic movie as well as one of Spielberg's best films. ""Jaws"" will always be the definitive shark movie, and nothing can compare to this masterpiece. I give it a 10 out of 10.",

580,29 December 2003,hung_fao_tweeze,8," This is a pretty darn good film, but....","This film just never did anything to me. This is surprising considering that I think it is very well made in almost every way. I was an outcast on this movie when it first came out because I must have been the only being on this planet that did NOT rush to see it. But I heard about it every damn day for months. After the hysteria died down and a few years later I viewed it. I couldn't figure it out. It was a very good film but it was nowhere as good as everybody made it out to be. So, I must face it. I am immune to this movie. Nevertheless, I think it is very much worthwhile viewing and would recommend it. The characters are good and almost cliche by some of todays Spielberg standards. The acting is top-notch and convincing. The story is almost too easy to follow - it's practically a template for future similar movies. And, yes, there are quite a few tense moments with the occasional body-part cameo. The shark? Yeah, Ok it is convincing when it needs to be. In fact, this movie has probably single-handedly put the kibosh on the rest of the world's remaining shark population forever. More people die from being kicked by horses every year than by encounters with sharks - but this movie got people worried. I suppose you could classify this movie as having cultural impact as well. Not a bad feat for a film. I give this film a good rating but I tend to not go out of my way to see it. It's kind of an Irwin Allen-on-meth-and-it's-a-sunny-day-type film.",

582,28 July 2022,Newdaylemonade,10, You are going to need a bigger TV,"A movie that keeps its intensity all the way through. You always feel the presence of the shark even when it is not there this is achieved by featuring first person shots. Jaws also achieves a claustrophobic feel even when the characters are on land. But definitely the best part of the film are the characters. One of the best character writings ever. You can see how scared Brody due to his fear of the water. He is determined to kill the shark to keep the town and his family safe. His love for his son is fantastically shown by the short and cute scene where his son mimics his movements. And even when he makes mistakes you feel for him. Hopper is a oceanographer who thinks he knows all about shark but is terrifyingly surprised when the shark is not behaving naturally. Hopper and Brody have an amazing chemistry between them. The conversation between the two is natural, funny and scary. But hands down the best character is Quint. The shark hunter who will destroy any shark for the right amount of money. His monologues are astonishingly written and acted out. You can see the terrified look on his face when he talks about his past. He is also a natural with Hopper and Brody even though being a little rude to them. The boat Orca is a very good final act setting for the movie because now the characters can't go to a safe place so they are forced to take action. The movie ends in a very climactic way with the shark eating Quint and Brody killing the shark which is a very good character arc because he was the most afraid of the creature. Quint also gets a good character arc he goes down with his ship trying to kill his target even in his last moments. The movie ends with Brody and Hopper sailing on a piece of wood.",

Speilburg is a masterful director, the actors are superb, and for a 1975 movie, the special effects are great.

I watch it now and it still evokes the same fears I had in 1973, my favorite scenes are still the same.  This is a classic because it hits on our most basic fears and insecurities.  Lovers of scary movies love the rush of being frightened.  It is a personal challenge to see if we can handle it.  I am a horrible swimmer, so staying out of the water became easier after this one. Spielberg created a masterpiece despite the challenges of working with a mechanical shark.  The suspense builds scene after scene, even though we don't even see the shark early on.

589,8 February 2007,bigbadbass3,10, A defining moment in film history.,"If you're a filmmaker and you've made what turned out to be a ""summer blockbuster"" since the summer of 1975, then you owe a debt of gratitude to Steven Spielberg. ""Jaws"" is not only an amazing film in pretty much every way(OK, the shark is phony looking, but it's not like they had CGI or Stan Winston), it is the movie that redefined the way movies are marketed, not mention it raised the bar for filmmakers everywhere. ""Jaws"" could easily have been a mess, what with the budgetary constraints, uncooperative islanders, bad weather, untried methods and relative inexperience of it's director. It could've been remembered as one of movie history's greatest blunders, or worse, not remembered at all. Steven Spielberg, however, chose talent over star power and the power of suggestion over shock value and gave us a masterpiece, not just of horror and adventure, but of true human-factor driven movie magic. It's not the shark that makes ""Jaws"" great, though it serves it's purpose just fine. It's the characters. It's the knowledge that, this isn't some alien planet or time long past or yet to come. It could be anytime, anywhere, anyone(assuming that you live near the ocean). Sharks are real and the events described in ""Jaws"" are not at all far removed from reality(i.e. - New Jersey, 1916, the Mattewan Creek incident, Rodney Fox, Henry Bource, etc). We've seen the startling images of massive great white sharks leaping from the water at 30 mph to rend some unsuspecting seal into shreds of torn flesh and shattered bone. We've seen the scars of the survivors. Aside from that, we've all felt out of our element, up against things we don't understand and fear, just like Chief Brody. Many of us have felt the drive to fight and win, regardless of the cost to ourselves or others, like Quint. Some of us have rushed into danger, brimming with confidence and know-how, only to be defeated by something too big or powerful for our skills, like Hooper. ""Jaws"" is a very human tale, giant carnivorous fish aside. There is also the technical aspect of ""Jaws"". Verna Fields' masterful, Academy Award winning editing, cutting in all the right places to heighten the tension or magnify the emotions. There is the incredible, unforgettable and oft-imitated score by the great John Williams. His massive, pounding shark theme is forever linked, not just to sharks, but to the dread of what's beneath you, unseen, ready, waiting and hungry. Then, of course there is Spielberg himself, giving us images of naked flesh from below, unaware of the unseen beast stalking from below. Images of children playing as one of their own is torn asunder in massive jaws, no pun intended(well, maybe...). The image of that fin, cleaving water like a blade cleaves meat, moving towards a helpless victim. Spielberg waited, giving us teasing glimpses of his behemoth so that when it is fully revealed, our imaginations are already primed and giving us our own ideas of what the monster looks like. It is both a joy and a jolt when the titular beast breaks the surface before Brody, scaring at least two years off of his life. ""Jaws"" is a great film, pure and simple. It is funny, exciting and frightening, all at once. It is a standard by which others should be measured. I assure you, though, if you wish to stand up next to this masterpiece, you'll need a bigger boat.",

593,1 September 2012,JoshSharpe,10, Watch it. Just watch it.,"Some movies have such a powerful effect on someone that it makes them take action. Or, in this case, not take action. For instance, after watching ""Jaws"", I may never go into the water again. And if I do, splashing is not an option. The first time this was a few years ago and frankly, I remember it being boring. I am here to say I no longer think that. Yes, it is a bit slow at times but as a whole, that takes nothing away from this movie. Martin Brody is a police deputy on a popular resort island. One morning, he discovers a woman has been killed by what looks like a shark. He panics and plans to shut down the beach, but the mayor just dismisses it as a boating accident. When another shark attack occurs, a search team goes to find and kill the shark but a specialist named Matt Hooper discovers it's the wrong one. This leads to another bigger search involving a man named Quint and together the three men go on a mission to find this shark. With good acting, a good script, and an excellent plot, this is a fabulous film that is definitely a must see.",
594,27 January 2007,general-melchett,9, Steven Spielberg's first great success...,"If it hadn't been for Jaws, Steven Spielberg would probably never have become the success he is today. His direction is truly brilliant - capturing the horror and sudden shock of shark attacks in a way that has not been equalled yet. The special effects are good, even by today's standards - the blood actually looks half convincing even if the mechanical shark itself isn't exactly top-class. Jaws was a simple idea - a shark plaguing a beach and killing the civilians - turned into a great film that inspired several followings (this isn't exactly a cult film) and several less-than-brilliant sequels. Steven Spielberg owes all the success he has today to Jaws - 30 years on, people are still loving it like it's still the 70s. And it is actually quite harrowing in parts - lots of fake blood and screaming. Jaws' death at the end is massive - an image that will stick in your mind long after the screen in front of you goes blank. And that is Steven Spielberg's greatest talent - creating monumental images in film. From the menacing start to the action-packed end, this is, in every sense, a classic. 9/10",

This is the movie which made the line ""We are gonna need a bigger boat"" one of the most iconic lines in all of cinema. The soundtrack of this movie is one of the most influential and has been imitated by numerous other musicians. Jaws revolves around the life of a police chief whose duty is to ensure the safety of the people swimming in the water. Due to a killer shark who manages to kill two people, chief Brody tries to close the beach but is not allowed to do so as the people in that area are dependent on the tourists in order to run their business. However, due to the death of another person, the beach is closed until the killer shark is captured. A fisherman volunteers to do so in exchange of a hefty reward. After that the chief, fisherman and the marine biologist who was called in for his expertise on sharks. Now, on the boat we witness some of the most thrilling scenes seen at the time it was released. The soundtrack heightened the suspense which made it all the more riveting to watch. The film features a number of unusual camera angles which is a testament to the perfectionism of Steven Spielberg. The movie is well-known to have gone well over budget and also exceeding its production time by 100 days. The final product though makes it worth the wait and Jaws propelled Spielberg into stardom. Jaws must be watched by one and all but be prepared for one hell of a ride.",

For most of the movie you don't see anything of the shark not even a trail of ripples in the water. When you do see the shark it looks like a giant rubber puppet. It's was so close to going to sleep in the middle of it but didn't figuring I would never go back and finish it if I did.

This movie made me go out about 5 feet into the ocean water when I went there. I swear, to me, this is the greatest film ever made (no offense to Godfather fans). Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss played their parts extremely well, as Brody and Hooper, but the man who should have won best actor was easily Robert Shaw. He greatly illustrated the part of Captain Quint, the salty old sea captain from years back. But the entire last half of the movie was definitely the best I'd ever seen. The scenes from the Orca were great, and the parts of the actors balanced out the movie. Scheider provided the worrier, the easy-to-panic man who's scared to death of the ocean but bravely steps up when he's the only one who can kill the shark [Smile you son of a -----! :)]. Dreyfuss gave the comic bits and the memorable lines, and Shaw, of course, gave the movie the best actor of the decade in my opinion. Jaws was the basic summer film; shark attacks, the chief police officer acts in the town's best interest, the mayor tries to stop it, and before we know it we find ourselves in the midst of a crisis not unlike the 1916 conflict that actually occurred. I give this movie my highest recommendations.",

Based loosely off a real-life incident that happened in New Jersey, it scared readers out of the water. While some of the book's content left much to be desired, along came Universal Studios. And a young director by the name of Steven Spielberg was given the chance to make the book into a summer fright film. The rest is cinematic history. By now, we all know the story, so here's the overview: A monstrously-large great white shark has come into the waters off Amity Island, feasting upon swimmers. Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) along with shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and salty fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) are tasked with hunting down and killing the shark. Everything about this movie works wonderfully from the beautiful cinematography to the fast-paced editing and the legendary Jaws theme. Forgiving some fake-looking shark effects, the film will at turns chill you and thrill you. The finale is particularly nerve-racking.

To watch this film in the cinema all those years ago when it was released was like an epiphany. I suspect that most people must have been aware of the story line before they viewed the film but quite naturally would have wanted to watch it first. The film hits you from the first second and keeps the tension and excitement throughout. Once in a while a film comes along which just bursts on to the film scene and it is immediately obvious that you are watching something very special. I would highly recommend anybody watch this magnificent creation. To the cast and crew that were responsible for this classy piece of work I would personally like to thank them all for their efforts and the professionalism and craft that they all applied in its making. Once again when the resulting film is very good the total seems to be greater than the sum of all its parts and in my opinion this is one of those films. This film has numerous added ingredients which are naturally occurring but only in the better films and it is these intangibles which make the special films special.

Jaws is subtle, clever and at times hilarious, and unlike most blockbusters does not rely on special effects and trifling acts of sensationalism to sell. The film is about a killer shark, but for the first half of the film we do not see her - this is what makes the film great - we are able instead to concentrate on the way humans react to this unseen force. The scheming town mayor is an accurate satire on the self-important local busy-body who thinks only of the financial ruin the shark could cause. Don't miss the on going duels between the rich college boy Hooper and the working class hero Quint - it is here where some of the best dialogue appears. The first half of the film is so good one almost forgets about the shark as a physical entity, more of an abstract notion which is only conceived by the way the islanders behave. The second half is where all the action happens as far as seeing the shark up close and personal.",
628,13 February 2006,crazyrabbits,10, Don't go in the water...,"I was saddened to hear of the death of Peter Benchley, the author of Jaws, and I decided to go back and look at what was his most successful book-to-movie adaptation, which of course was ""Jaws"". No matter who you are, you will love this film. Essentially the first ""blockbuster"" (grossing more than $100 million dollars) film to hit theaters, it's surprising how minimalistic the movie really is. It's just three guys and a shark out in the sea for over a third of the film. What makes the film work so well is the performances of the three main actors (Schieder, Dreyfus, and Shaw) and the editing style that Steven Spielberg used to create the atmosphere and tension in the film. We still feel the influence of ""Jaws"" even today, as it has caused thousands of people to swear off swimming in the ocean due to a fear of sharks. If you've already seen this film, you don't need me to tell you how good it is. It is, by all rights, still a film classic, and it's legend will endure for some time yet.",

It is interesting to note that I have seen this movie maybe ten or more times and it still delivers on acting, scenery and score with excellent directing. The premise is a good and fresh one. A rogue monster sized shark that likes to eat and kill and then repeat makes itself at home in the waters off Amity where it just snacks until they get wise and take a second look. We then are introduced to politics not solutions and before you know it, we are immersed it what appears to be a perfectly plausible premise with everyday people simple like-minded people caught every which way. That's what keep us entertained. I just finished watching it again just now and I noticed that even though I knew the ending, I waited to see every bit of it. The fine acting does that. At the time this came out, no one wanted to go swimming in 3 feet of water 10 feet from the shore as the movie shares. Why? That's where most of the attacks take place. Chilling sub-story comes up about the USS Indianapolis which was the ship that delivered the nuclear bomb to its secret destination and on the way back was torpedoed. The men who survived turned into fast shark food. Unfortuanely this was a true story. Only 300 survived out of 1100. This adds realism to the main plot quite nicely as told by Robert Shaw expertly I might add. What a pleasant way to spend 2 hours. Good movie to eat your favorite snack and have a tasty drink too. This one lives on for the next generation and the next too. Enjoy",

Too bad flicks spawned from 'Jaws' (including the sequels) – just plain sucked.

This was no boating accidentthis was a very hungry stomach lined with huge teeth and propelled by fins. This carcarion carcarius eats and eats and eats.

655,11 July 2020,TheHonestCritic,4, We're going to need a better movie.,"""Jaws"" (1975), if there were lyrics in the signature theme song, it would go like this: ""bor-ing, bor-ing, bor-ing, bor-ing....."" This ""film"" is based off a novel (big shock), by Peter Benchley. I have read the novel, and it is actually better than this ""movie""! They had a decent concept, but, it has been marred by poor scriptwriting and mediocre acting. You would think being a film directed by the one and only Steven Spielberg it would be great! But, this ""film"" has a boring and cliched story, standard to terrible acting and cheesy special effects. The story isn't a total loss, there are a few scenes that stand out. However, the rest of the ""film"" just drags on way too long. It should have focused more on the shark hunt! One thing that is a brilliant idea, I have to admit, the shark doesn't make it's first official appearance until about an hour into the ""film"". The fact that the shark stays hidden until that particular scene made the creature all the more mysterious. Therefore, it makes the scenario all the more intense. On that note, the scriptwriters were on the right track. But, I think if they followed the original novel a little more closely, or proofread the script one more time, then the plot line would have been a whole lot stronger. Maybe it was scriptwriter Carl Gottlieb that screwed it up? For those who may not now, the actual author, Peter Benchley took part in writing the script! He should have paid more attention to Carl's contributions or changes to the screenplay. As for the acting, it's standard to just mediocre. The only worthy performances come from Roy Schneider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss. Those three are the only actors who appear to actually be trying. As for the rest of the actors and actresses, they are just terrible and even a bit over the top. Now for the special effects, most of them are well-done and hold up to this day. However, the longer the shark is on-screen, the less realistic it becomes. Plus, some of the blood looks fake as well. The ironic thing is that this prop shark is more realistic than the ones in the unnecessary sequels. Usually, special effects are supposed to get better over time, but in this franchise it's completely backwards! How ironic, right? The only two positives in this ""movie"" are the sets/locations and the soundtrack. Being filmed mostly in Martha's Vineyard, in Massachusetts, it gave the ""film"" a decent atmosphere. Finally, the soundtrack by the one and only John Williams is fantastic. He is my all-time favorite film score composer and this one is no exception! Whenever I hear the main ""Jaws"" theme, I immediately think of this ""film"". Plus, that theme is so versatile, you can use it for pretty much any scary situation in a movie or TV show! That's the marking of a great film score, when it's good for more than just the ""film"" it was written for in the first place. ""Jaws"" had a lot of potential, but overall, I think it was just a jumbled mess. Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite movie directors, most of the films he gets involved with are fantastic. ""Jaws"", for me, is one of his weakest films, along with ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (2008). Still, I think I would watch ""Jaws"" over ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" any day! I am glad I saw it, but I don't think I'll be seeing it again. It's just a boring ""movie"" as a whole! I rate this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Stay away from ""Jaws"" and especially it's horrible unnecessary sequels. Swimming in the ocean is a lot more entertaining than watching this ""film""!",

The technology is very dated but I still have tremendous admiration for the iconic score and sound employed by the film. John Williams went on to compose many iconic film scores and the work he did for Jaws holds up very well. The story is a little thin and there's very little in the way of subtext, but that's ok as there is enough here to make Jaws a fun and enjoyable viewing experience.

Between the sleepy little New England town, cozy beaches and homely locals, and the dark unknown that is the sea creates shear contrast thus making it all the more terrifying. Through no intentional act by the young Spielberg, merely coincidental issues with the shark robot more famously known as Bruce, the audience doesn't see the antagonist until halfway through the film. This creates suspense that is hard to match and many have used the same approach since and has some-what become a staple in the horror/thriller genre. This is a classic above genre and is the reason we've enjoyed so many other Spielberg projects since. Let's also not forget this is John Williams debut and first collaboration with Spielberg who has gone on to receive countless score nominations, even though it's arguable the Jaws ""duuudda-duuuuddaa-Duda-duda"" is his true masterpiece.

677,26 February 2013,cosmonadz,10, Summer Blockbuster at its best,Steven Spielberg take a bow. This film has it all (except aliens and cowboys). Set in a sleepy summer beachy town terror lurks in the depths. The tempo is what I like best building around unforgettable characters and its display of power struggles from mayor to chief to captain! Suspense at its finest. The 3 pivotal characters are introduced in heir own right and end up walking the same line. The cat and mouse game not only between shark and man but between hooper quint and brody is a delight. Not wanting to get too technical but for a fuller appreciation of the movie I recommend watching the making of the movie too. Back to the film itself the locations and sub story's all tie in greatly to the bigger picture. With minimal effects and maximum joy it's a movie that you'll enjoy watching over and over again. Just as good when I saw it he first time. The standout scene has to be quints speech about the USS INDIANAPOLIS. I've watched this film many times and it always gets my full attention. On my last note who can forget John Williams. Did he make he beast even more frightening the music score is timeless. Most deserved Oscar winning performance. You'll never swim the same again.,

Does it deserve all the hype that surrounds it? And most importantly, does it compare to the other genius films of Spielberg? Well, you see, at first I thought the idea of a shark tearing the heck out of people was a bit meh, what I mean was, it was a long day, I was tired when I watched this movie, but after the first kill, this immediately woke me up, this was terrifying. IT WAS AN ACTUAL HORROR FILM! No coo-coo crackheads busting into a woman's house and tormenting her family, something that ACTUALLY scared people. There were no other films like this back then, as soon as the film released, tons of beaches were closed, oceans. THIS FILM CAUSED CHAOS! And I love it, huge A+",

But once Martin, Matt, and Quint get on the Orca the movie officially begins. It's kind of like a part 1 and part 2 movie. My favorite part is when Matt and Quint are having dinner, and they are drinking to their wounds. Then the mood changes when Quint tells a story when he was on the USS Indianapolis.

You can relate to the characters and feel for them. For the time the effects are wonderful and the scenery is amazing. Some scenes are gruesome but the thing that makes the film better is the haunting, iconic soundtrack. It just lifts the film from good to greatness.

The film included a very good suspense music announcing the shark. I really don't know how much it cost. But for me it was succeed! Good film. Good suspense music and especially very good shark size. I haven't seen such a big shark of my life and that was what I liked the most in the movie. Apparently, Steven Spielberg is the most famous director of all time and he made many good movies!!! One of my favourite Steven Spielberg's films were Jurassic Park (with dinosaurs),Jaws,and perhaps some other ones (perhaps). Steven Spielberg is a genius.If you are under 16, you shouldn't see the film. Perhaps a little bit stupid of me,(I said PERHAPS)but I am fourteen and I saw the bloody scary movie. I saw it three times in total and I still like it! BE CAREFUL: it contains a lot of blood and like I said in the review:you are not obliged to see it if it scares you a lot. Actually I am not really sure, because, even if you are under-age for a certain kind of film, perhaps you could still watch it (if doesn't scarre you, of course) but I am really not sure.Don't ask me any more questions about it.

I also like the lines they have in the movie the most famous one is ""we're gonna need a bigger boat"" that is the best line in the movie.

The interaction between Brody, Hooper, and Quint is truly special, and the monalouge about the USS Indianapolis is one of the most creepy experiences I've ever had.

But during the summer of 1975, parents could have been forgiven for blaming their children's aversion to water on the precociously young director, who might as well have developed his classic Hitchcockian eco-thriller in tandem with the British government as a means of enforcing the hosepipe ban during the following year's drought.

In a lot of ways this is a unbelievable film (especially how the shark behaves at times). But besides this the film is very effectively shot and  the acting is more than well. The film's score by John Williams is also very effective. I think that he's one of the greatest (film-)compo- sers that exists these days.

All you movie-fans already know the story, and I just want to share my profits of It. The unique mind of a shoot that Spielberg holds, make him one of the greatest in my opinion. (OK, the whole team behind him should be applauded too, for getting this together.) It still stands out, as 40 year old piece of film, and matures continuously like a fine wine. Still watching It from time to time, one can always find new angles to enjoy. Born this summer, I never saw it fresh, of course. But I can imagine the hype it represented 1975. Nevermind the fake shark's failures, or the sometimes deficient facts of the script, the luck of the casting is what really stands out. Without the grumpy Robert Shaw it would have been a complete different movie. Without Richard Dreyfuss as the logical, sensitive marine Biologist it would not be the same, too. Roy Schreider's sheriff of the Amity Island struggles with both family and the city community for keeping the people ""out of water"". You can easily find extracts of yourself in all of the three men: Stubborness, fear, insecurity, resignation and anger. That is why I like this movie so much. Watch it with Brody's eyes, next time with Quint's. The other next time with Hooper's. And another time with the Mayor's? Just never, ever buy the fact of some kind of a smart shark.

Given this situation, it was a little hard for me to look past the cliche and overly dramatic flailing about that the actors, shark, and camera work seems to do. However, the structure of the movie draws one in, despite the ridiculous nature of the plot. We are given a clear picture of the stakes for this town, the mayor, and the people that had decided to face down the monster that terrorizes the beach. When a small town becomes prey to a large offshore shark, the mayor, a local scientist, and a sea captain team up to defeat the deadly monster and save both the towns citizens and the local tourist industry.

These scenes are often filmed in counter-dives that embrace the shark's point of view. Supported by John Williams' famous music, the result is even more terrifying. By not showing everything under the water, the director makes the spectator's imagination work at full speed. Shark hunting in the second part of the film remains for me the pinnacle of cinema. Some scenes are unforgettable. For example, when bait at the back of the boat, Sheriff Brody sees the face of the squale rising from the water under his nose.

It's got just about everything: action, suspense, good acting, and a great storyline, thanks to Peter Benchley.  I especially liked Robert Shaw as Quint, giving an almost flawless performance.  Richard Dreyfus does a good job as the young, rich Hooper and Roy Schreider plays the movie's protagonist and all-around good guy Chief Brody well. My favorite part of the movie is the first half, contrary to popular opinion.  It does a great job of setting the tone of Amity, and we can relate with the town's struggles.  The last half is great too, however, and some of the best action scenes ever filmed are in it. This is a movie you should really see.  I have no problems with it whatsoever, except it would have been nice to have more.  Bravo to Spielberg for pulling it off!",
729,8 June 2022,Diablo_99,9, Jaws,"Out of all the movies that I've watched, this one has to be my favorite. A good chunk of why Jaws was so successful was because of John Williams's renowned score that magnified the terror of the titular shark. In addition, the dialogue is iconic because of one liners such as ""You're gonna need a bigger boat"" and ""Smile you son of a b*tch"". Easily my #1.",

Yes, it was of course a blockbuster and probably changed movies forever. But it is also so much more than simply an action movie or a horror movie. Jaws is an outstanding drama with well realized characters and great dialog, largely delivered by one of the all time best trio of performances ever together on film. Richard Dreyfuss gives us a comical and interesting scientist; Roy Schieder, a relatable protagonist, and Robert Shaw should have been nominated for an Oscar for his brilliant work. (Schieder too for that matter, he often gets overlooked due to Shaw's show stopping characterization. This is not a movie about a shark attacking people.

It's a great blend of suspense and action that kept audiences on the edge of their seats when it was first released, and it still does the same today. One of the most intriguing things about the film is what they didn't show on screen: the shark. Keeping the shark off-camera built up a sense of anticipation and made the film more suspenseful and intense. One of my favourite movies of all time! Soundtrack is perfect. Acting is perfect too! It is very good that they used animatronic shark. Actually animatronic shark looked more cool and scary than real great white shark!",

Half on land, and half at sea, the film is as much from the horror genre as it is adventure. The concept of filming from water level and from the sharks POV, combined with the infamous score and spot on acting, Jaws is sealed if not fully digested into our memory banks. 35 years later the script still holds my attention and the terror returns with almost every shot of the enemy, both ""Bruce"" and ""Quint"", sans the obvious mechanics of the shark and drunken machismo of Robert Shaw. The trio is filled out by Roy Shreider Richard Dreyfus and the voices of common sense and oceanic reason and the tension between actors is only overtaken by the drama of the adventure at sea.

A real run of the mill movie by the time I seen it, so even though I was so young and on my own, it was ok to go in and watch it.  I ran out of the cinema and back to our apartment when I seen the head scene.  I had nightmares for weeks afterwards.  Since then I've seen this classic countless times and I enjoy it every time.  There's just something about the atmosphere in the film that I find infectious.  The casting is the most natural I've seen. Each of the main characters is so believable, different and interesting in their own way.  A tired middle aged cop from New York, a young rich scientist in love with his work, and an old weather beaten shark fisherman with scars to remember most of his encounters. I've yet to see interaction like this between 3 actors. The love\hate atmosphere on the boat is just gripping. I bought the DVD version for my kids.  I'd rather the original because in the DVD version in the scene before they sing; `Show me the way to go home', the whale sound effect is smudged out and replaced with a more 90's politically correct whale sound.  I thought the original effect added much more to the atmosphere of the film.  But it is cool to see it digitally touched up.  And what about the Score?  Is there a more memorable score for a movie?  Space Odyssey 2001 springs to mind but even that masterpiece borrows from the classical world.  That music was not written for that film. I loved the book too, but I have to say the movie is better.  I know it's strange but it's true.  I love movies but I've yet to get the same level of enjoyment from a movie as I did from Jaws.  And that includes E.T., Close Encounters, Star Wars and so on.  Jaws is a marvel. I'm glad I was so young when I first seen it because it probably wouldn't have had the affect on me that it had had I watched it at an older age.  Ok in hindsight and if you like nitpicking you can find a few things wrong with this film.  Like the missing chair after the scene were they caught something with the fishing rod, or it wasn't really summer when the filmed it.  Big deal!  Movies like this are about imagination aren't they? These inconsistencies had to be pointed out to me before I could see them for myself.  In my opinion a good movie with no directing or editing errors is not what makes it good movie. Jaws is King and very underrated in my opinion.",

This has to be one of the greatest movies of all time because it sends fear and intensity into your head and entire body but the strange thing is that it's a really well made movie. The characters are well acted, Hooper is my personal favorite, the filming itself is impressive and of course the legendary score is probably the greatest piece of all time in the movie industry.

One hallmark of this new era, which is still with us, is that the genres that used to be confined to B movies--such as science fiction and horror--are now the subjects of major, respectable motion pictures.  To me, it is a little sad that the ""big"" movies no longer aspire to serious themes, but instead confine themselves to the stuff of comic books.  After 1975, mainstream movies were no longer for adults, but are instead geared to teenagers, or perhaps to the child within us.

747,5 July 2020,TheHoodOfSwords,9, Amazing,"I mean what do you want me to say about Jaws? It's phenomenal, the tension and action, in particular, is done incredibly well. One thing in particular I like is a lot of the movie is just talking, and if you've seen the film you'll notice a lot of the seemingly meaningless throwaway lines are actually important and are some nice foreshadowing. The animatronic work is also done incredibly well for the shark and it does actually look pretty damn real. The first half you feel the uneasiness grow as the shark takes more and more victims, once it gets to the second half and it's all about chasing the shark it turns into a much more action-packed and is much more character-driven as you find out more about the Quint as well as the other two. Something I like about this film is that while Chief Brody doesn't say why he's trying to hunt the shark you can tell from earlier interactions in the movie that it's actually because of his family and wanting to keep them safe. I truly enjoyed some of the long take action camera movements and the dolly zoom on Brody at the beach is iconic. Loved seeing this one again, when I was 10 I tried watching it and I got super spooked so I turned it off 10 minutes in.

One of Nature's most feared animals is the Shark and to create a horror film around that animal, you could guess what the response should be like. It gave viewers something to actually be scared about and that was going swimming. It had the same effect on me when I watched this movie when I was 10. I could not go swimming and although I overcame it and have a passionate love of studying sharks, I still get scared every time I start swimming in deep water (even in a lake or pond).

I thought to myself, ""Man, I better get this movie on DVD and watch it again to see if it was as good as I remembered."" It was definitely worth it. It brought back the action and scares of back when I first saw it back in 2007. It does start out slow, but it gradually builds up to the climactic last 45-60 minutes. I'll start out with the acting. It was great. The actors worked very well with the script, and they kept the movie entertaining the first 60-75 minutes. I will say, the beginning was kind of boring, and I was just waiting for the end hour. The end all together makes up for it though. The special effects were awesome for the 70's era of movies. How they made the shark that moves and bites down and stay in the budget of 8 million dollars, I don't know. Although, money was a lot different back in the 70's. I don't know. Anyway, Everything about this movie was pretty good, especially for the 70's, when film wasn't always high-quality like this. In fact the only reason this movie gets a 9 is because it had a boring start. I don't really know what else to review. OH! How about the story? Pretty cliché'd these days, but probably original back in '75. Today, there are poopy shark movies where they can fly, walk on land, and can stay still, and everybody who knows about sharks know they can't stay still (except one species) or else they suffocate. Syfy really messed up the killer shark genre. Like Sharknado, Super Shark, Dinoshark and 2- headed Shark Attack, just to name a few. It's kind of hard to come across a decent shark movie like this one nowadays. Anyway, I still really like this movie. I give it a 90% because it is realistic for it's time, and is one of the most creative, original killer shark movies I've ever seen.",

This is not just proved by Spielberg's film as a whole, but also by the iconic scene where Robert Shaw tells a fish story after comparing scars with Richard Dreyfuss. Old classics never drown.

Jaws is one of those movies I never get tired of. It is still as entertaining and suspenseful now as it was when I first saw it on the big screen in the 70s. Spielberg does a wonderful job in not showing the actual shark until the latter part of the film. It really helps to build the suspense, leaving it up to the viewer's imagination as to what Amity and its people are really up against.  A masterful musical score by John Williams helps to move this along wonderfully. The score really breathes life in to the movie. The music is so recognizable today that most die-hards of the cinema are instantaneously familiar with it.

I must admit, that I have seen the movie eight times in the Theater and at least thirty-seven times on video.  Why would someone who is thirty-four years old, happily married, satisfied with his career, sociable, in other words ""normal"", if that is still considered normal these days, still infatuated with a movie he first saw as a child?  Once in our lifetime, we see something, hear something, believe something, feel something, that we just will never forget.

Spielberg has a knack for knowing how his audience wants to be treated and he calmly goes about setting up a variety of scares and thrills that do their things without fuss. There's a lot to admire in the tension-and-release techniques he employs and his smooth cutting sense (the editor is Verna Fields although Spielberg is in complete control) helps move the narrative along at a natty pace. His clever way of slowly introducing us to the monster (in this case a shark) is well thought-out and effective. John Williams' score is excellent, done at a time he was delivering his best work (""Star Wars"", ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"") and before bombast became his standard.

Some of Jaws' best scenes of fright / suspense (1 voting point for each scene) occur when we merely imagine the great white shark (25 feet long!) may soon surface and bare several rows of jagged, triangular teeth.  When we finally get a look at the man-eating fish, it turns out to be a machine with unconvincing--and unnatural--dewlaps that form around the corners of its mouth during rare moments when the shark is not shown chomping into tourists.  I saw this one at a tender age.  I was glued to my seat when, in the film, a beach full of terrified swimmers race over each other after somebody spots the all to familiar dorsal fin poking out of the water.  During production, the machine-shark was dubbed ""Bruce,"" after Spielberg's lawyer.  All in all, this suspenser is worth a viewing... too bad computers in 1975 weren't sophisticated enough to erase those goofy, over-lapping hinges on 'Bruce's' mouth.",
772,16 June 2021,kingofdanerds,10, The film that still makes audiences afraid to go in the water,"Never has a film had a bigger impact than the first ever blockbuster film, Jaws. The film Jaws is based off of the Peter Benchley novel of the same name (of which I have not read). The film was released in 1975 and was directed by a then widely unknown film director Steven Spielberg. This would be the film that would put Spielberg on the map. The film stars Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw, and Lorraine Gary. As stated, the film was a MASSIVE success. It performed critically well with audiences and critics and the film would perform so financially well that it became the first blockbuster film and would forever change the film industry. The film had a budget of $9 million and has made $472 million since release. The film also has music done by John Williams (which I will touch upon later).",
773,24 September 2018,torrascotia,7, Still hold up....more or less...,"Jaws was the original summer blockbuster movie. Its the story of a police chief who believes a shark is responsible for a number of unexplained deaths and his fight with a local mayor, who is worried that closing the resort to protect the public will destroy the local economy. 
However the action with the shark seems to have overtaken the rest of the narrative in many peoples minds due to the effectiveness of the shark scenes which terrified audiences at the time. Anyone who watched this movie in the past recalls the shark attacks but the main driver of the story, which was about officials arguing about financial survival versus public safety, is less well remembered. 
Many of the sequels of Jaws seemed to focus more on the shark action than narrative, which seems to have angered many of the fans of the original to the extent they have exaggerated how bad they sequels actually were. 
The thing is, the shark scenes, driven by the now famous score were only as effective as they were due to them having a shark which looked terrible on film. As a result its screen time was minimised which added to the air of menace. 
The cast in this movie is iconic. However many of the deaths come as less of a shock as they do in the second movie. In some cases not everyone who dies is a sympathetic character.....
Watching this movie in 2018, this is no longer a film which is as shocking as it would have been in 1975. Horror movies have moved on and this is now seen as more of a thriller than something that would deliver real scares. As such its viewed more in terms of being a decent quality movie with great characters but the effects etc may not scare your average cinema goer.

'Jaws' the ultimate shark film has been the most frightening film since its 1975 release to audiences. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw star as Chief Martin Brody, oceanographer Matt Hooper and shark hunter Quint on the hunt for a killer great white who killed and devoured a young woman and little boy. The film is suspenseful with a spooky score by John Williams to match (if you hear the music get out of the water). Many viewers are so frightened by the film that they develop the misconception that all sharks are killers and will eat them. That is true in only 100 cases where great whites do kill humans (this is actual scientific data), but this is not entirely true. There's no need to fear sharks all the time. Anyway, Steven Spielberg shows off a spectacular film that will make you fearful of going into the water.",

Yes the storyline and shark may not be so true to life but these minor items are easily forgotten when you become imminently absorbed in the film. I think the key difference between this film and merely a good film is the atmosphere evoked by Spielberg - We feel for the town , the men going off to battle this beast , their families even the shark. It conjures up all kind of machismo sentiments - Brave men heading out to brave the seas and kill a monster , camaraderie ,  historical briefings yet this film is not a ""guy film""",

788,8 July 2007,dobbin-4,8, Good horror flick for so many reasons,Jaws is a classic a classic 1975 horror movie that is good for may reasons 1. Class as in it is not just a gory shark movie 2. It does have the good gore that a good horror movie needs.3. It has a storyline thats not just about the shark and 4. It shows that sharks are not bad guys but that mayors are if they are like the one in this movie. The movie is about when a young girl gets eaten by a shark the chief of police tries to shut that beach down but the mayor does not because it is the summer time which leads to death and a great movie. Overall I rate this movie really well especially for a horror flick and has the class that most of them lack so if you have not already seen it see it. I rate it 88%.,

Usually a coward when it comes to thriller movies i was persuaded as a film fanatic to see the classic by my cinema showing the film on the big screen in its original glory to celebrate 30 years of it terrorising children out of the water, and after all the build up to the film i am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. I think this film really is a testament to Steven Spielberg's directing talent and a true suspense thriller. The acting in this is superb and although some scenes were rather predictable it did not spoil the suspense and thrill you feel when you hear that famous music. Richard Dreyfuss is well cast as the young scientist who along with Robert Shaw and Roy Scheider save Amity Island from the killer great white shark. And although the mechanical shark may look ever so slightly dated it is also a triumph technically. I am very pleased that finally I have sat and watched Jaws and even though I know now who dies and who survives i could watch it again and again.",

805,24 March 2015,JudgeChaos,10," It's been 40 years, is it safe to go back in the water yet?","Summer, 1975 Unknown director Steven Spielberg released a monster that changed the movie industry forever. Ever since it's release, people feared the ocean, and what lurks within it. I am of course talking about ""Jaws"". I first saw this movie when I found the DVD at my library (does anyone do that anymore?). Personally I wasn't scared of it. It's not the movie's fault, it's just EVERYONE talks about the major scares (I won't because I'm a nice person), so I already knew about the jump scares, and the disturbing images. It was fun to watch it with my mother, who was unaware of the scares. She screamed and jumped, and my sister, my dad, and I all laughed our butts off. It just goes to show that these effects are still scary to this day. Sure they look fake, but if they can make a person scream, then they're doing their job. Other than the scares, the characters are enjoyable too. By far, Quint is my favorite character. I love how he teases Brody and Hooper while they're on the Orca. It's like he's saying ""I'm the king of this castle, I can do what I want."" Hooper is also a fun character, and he probably has some of the funniest lines in the movie. Brody, even though he's the main character, is probably the stick in the mud out of the trio. I'm not saying he's bad, it's just Hooper and Quint steal the show. Overall, ""Jaws"" still holds up as a classic example of Steven Spielberg's genius directing. However, if you're curious about the source material, prepare for a group of unlikable assholes.",

And they trusted it into the hands of a 26 year old man. And since then a great name has been around in cinema history. Jaws is one of the greatest thrillers of all time. It is also one of the most frighting and edge of your seat thriller's. But the film's ain't as scary as the book. The story is pretty simple. A sleepy town which goes to panic pretty much like all crap modern day horror. But Jaws isn't crap this is brilliant. The acting is great the best is clearly by Robert Shaw. A great English star. The worst thing about this film is that it caused the sequels.,

The Two Towers, Guardians Of The Galaxy), this is the gem of them all. This movie has everything: suspense, drama, comedy, horror... EVERYTHING! The story is simple- man vs. shark. But somehow, Spielberg made a basic plot work entirely! First off, the characters are not only lovable and hilarious, but they give the sense of heart and fear for them. The shark scenes are consistently thrilling and fun to watch, close-up or not. The humor is filled with extremely witty one-liners and a few mature jokes(coming from Quint). The acting is fast- paced from start to finish, one of the biggest reasons why the characters are easy to connect with and like. Overall, Jaws is the greatest movie of all time in my opinion because of its fantastic cast of characters, intense shark sequences, smart humor, and a huge heart in the core of it.",
812,16 March 2016,julie-siegrist,7, Suspenseful and Iconic,"Jaws, now an iconic American film, was a film built around the premise of suspense. Why was the film so successful? What separated this film from other scary movies from the 70's & why are we still talking about it in 2016? To begin with, the soundtrack of the film utilizes an escalating trombone to instill tense, dramatic, and suspenseful moments in the film and counter it with silence, another tool of suspense, to build to those moments through emotion before the action starts. Throughout the film they utilize the technique of matching eye lines across cuts to form continuity and the illusion that these two separate images are looking into each other's eyes. Most notably this is seen in the opening scene with the kids on the beach. The guy is in one cut looking to the right, in the next cut the girl is looking to the left of the screen. This implies eye contact between these two characters, a method used commonly in film making nowadays. Lighting was also used effectively for continuity purposes in Jaws, using the angle of light to indicate that people are in different sides of the room in different shots, primarily in the cabin of the ship at night when the men are out hunting the shark. In fact, certain shots of individuals faces make this movie stand out because of the effect they have. In one of the first few scenes with the character of Brody the camera moves with Brody as he walks through crowds of people along the dock. We're following him because he is the main character, & the use of the camera like this shows the audience this in a subtle way. Close ups of people's faces can also do a number of things as are shown in this film. They can make you wonder what the character is thinking and bring you inside their head, or they can bring you, the viewer into the scene, creating a feeling of intensity or shock. Intensity is created when close shots are taken in the water during the shark attacks bringing you into the moment. Shock is found in the close up of the woman's face staring straight at the camera when she sees a fin in the water. Because of the close up, as a viewer, you can relate to her emotions and feel the shock for yourself. In one of the many beach scenes close ups and wide range shots are used to show our main character Brody viewing the water beyond the people who are close in the shot. A quick zoom occurs on Brody's face when he sees the shark, giving us a similar sense of realization as we watch. Techniques like this bring us viewers into the story and make it relevant to our own lives because we can relate to the emotions we are feeling on screen. ",
813,2 February 2006,danielnugent303,10, Simply the best,"You don't really need a synopsis. All you need to know is this is, in my opinion, the greatest movie ever.

When I was a kid this was shown on TV, it seemed, every other month. As a result it became a bit of a joke to many. Now viewed over 30 years after it was made this film hasn't aged a bit. The Shark looked fake in the 70's and it still looks fake now. The scares it provides, either seen or unseen, are very real though. I really can't praise this film enough.

With an opening scene (the now legendary 'First Attack') that rides high up in the ranks alongside the shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho', Speilberg, like the monster Great White in the movie, has proved himself a powerful force to be reckoned with. Apart from spawning three sequels (number two was okay, three and four, well lets not get into that shall we) Jaws is the ultimate monster movie which would only have its' perfect veneer tarnished if someone was to do a remake (Gus Van Sant's Psycho anyone?). The basic plot is that Satan's goldfish is snacking on the locals of Amity Island and it could cause a few problems as it is getting very close to the summer season and the tourists will be flocking in their droves to the island. It then comes down to three guys, Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider),  Icthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and a Captain Ahab style shark fisherman called Quint (Robert Shaw) to try to kill the beast. Speilberg uses the camera alongside John Williams' simple but classic haunting score to show the power of the Great White with exhilerating effect. While Quint's monologue of the events of what happened to the crew on the Indianapolis had audiences mesmerised, a couple of well positioned jolts in the movie had people leaping out of their seats with fear, Jaws has created what we have come to expect every year and that's the summer blockbuster.

Quint! Come on, the Indianapolis speech?!!!, brilliant!!! The movie is epic, a trilogy in one film, THE ATTACKS,THE 4th of July and THE HUNT! AAAAH, how can I live in a world of such mind numbing stupidity where people dismiss JAWS because they are lazy and cynical film viewers! You can't have an opinion on Jaws, you either love it or you are WRONG...sorry, THE END!",

843,11 April 2018,neazy,7, I wish I'd seen it when it came out.,"Jaws is a film which has probably suffered from its own popularity. Watching it for the first time now, inured to the endless tawdry sensationalism of all the shark attack stories that have followed, the great original loses some of its punch. The first half, in particular, suffers badly from this, and the uninteresting family relationships and bargain-basement small town politics contribute to a sense of shallowness and predictability. It is not a worthy setup for the second half, in which the film comes into its own. With the three men on their boat and the shark in the water, the tension is high, the dynamic between the men and its development under pressure is fascinating, and the shark feels genuinely mysterious and menacing, particularly with the clever minimisation of visual contact with the model. The ending doesn't quite do it justice, but on the whole the second half is a damn good yarn, and makes the film worthwhile on its own. Iconic.",

While watching Jaws you immediately get into it. You just want to scream get out of the water!!! The music by John Williams is great. When you hear the music you immediately know who's coming. I believe the first movie is always the best. And Jaws proves my theory. The other 3 remakes are not nearly as good as the original. Once I saw Jaws every other shark movie didn't even look good enough to rent. So if you want to watch a shark movie try this classic!",

857,26 September 2000,esb412,10, High-Concept Goes Swimming-The Importance of JAWS,"Attending film school for four years I had the opportunity to view several different kinds of films. There was always one film however that I always retreated to when it came to writing papers and class discussions, and that, is JAWS. JAWS has been my favorite film since I was a youngster, and it wasn't until NYU Film School that I learned the true significance of the film. JAWS may very well be considered the originator of what we know today as the ""high-concept"" film. In director Steven Spielberg's words, a high-concept film is one in which you can describe the whole plot and theme in less than 25 words. If you can do that, then you have a hit film. While up to this time, films generally opened in the major venues first (New York and Los Angeles), and gradually opened in more and more locations, the premiere of JAWS led to what is known as saturation opening. JAWS opened in approximately 400 theaters the weekend of July 4th, 1975. This strategy worked very well for JAWS, which grossed $7 million in its opening weekend. What also helped in the success in JAWS was the media, in TV and print form. One image dominated posters, newspapers and magazines at the time of JAWS' release, and that image featured a naked woman swimming along the surface as a huge phallic shark rises up towards her. The image was accompanied by various different tag lines, but realistically, it didn't matter what the it said-the complete image of a shark, teeth agape, rising up towards a beautiful young woman had a lasting effect on whomever saw the ad. As powerful as the print images were, music played a huge role in the promotion of JAWS. On the radio and television, composer John Williams' now-legendary ""JAWS theme"" was heard for the first time. The film ran throughout the summer of '75, breaking every box-office record and becoming the number one moneymaker of all time, only to be eventually ousted from that coveted spot by another Spielberg picture, E.T. In an age of overly-inflated movie ticket prices and multiple viewings, JAWS, the first high concept film that redefined and resurged a lagging Hollywood film industry back in the '70s, remains in the top twenty profit-making films of all time, and also this writer's favorite film. Thank you for the time.",

872,18 November 2020,iancolbyjackson,9, One of the most effective psychological horrors (Psych of Horror),"In the small tourist town of Amity Island, a woman is attacked by a shark while she is skinny-dipping. This causes many people, including the police chief, Martin Brody, to want to shut down all beaches until the problem is solved. However, the mayor, Larry Vaughn, disagrees and refuses to shut down all beaches, saying that it will cripple the tourist revenue and destroy the town. Brody, with the help of Ichthyologist Matt Hooper and ship captain Quint, embarks on an adventure to capture the beast, in an epic man vs. nature battle. The 1975 film, directed by Steven Spielberg, is an excellent horror that plays specifically on the fears of death and sharks. The cast of this film includes names like Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw, Lorraine Gary, Murray Hamilton, Peter Benchley, and many more.
Steven Spielberg uses an excellent form of horror to portray how frightening this shark really is, suspense. The suspense throughout the whole movie is used in more than one way. It is used through knowing what is going to happen to people before they even know it and just waiting for it to happen and through the main point of the film, the shark. In one of the scenes towards the beginning of the film, you see the mayor, Larry Vaughn, strolling down the beach line telling every tourist he sees to go and test the water. Sending them to what is going to end up a date with a killer shark. The suspense through this part of the movie is shown perfectly throughout everyone in the scene, as a viewer, I knew exactly what was going to happen to those people, but the suspense that I felt and the horror of just waiting for the shark to make quick work of them ate me up and made me even more frightened than I should have.
The film also uses suspense when it comes to the main part of this film, the killer beast, the shark. While you may not think that the shark is very suspenseful because you never see it chasing something or swimming up to the boat. That is exactly why it is one of the most suspenseful parts of this film because you never do see the shark do any of those things, you hardly ever see the shark at all. While I was doing some research on why Jaws was such an effective horror movie I found a quote from Alfred Hitchcock, this quote said ""A bomb is under the table, and it explodes: That is a surprise. The bomb is under the table but it does not explode: That is suspense."" I feel that this quote explains Spielberg's work and just shows why his work was so effective. If the shark was seen at the beginning it would have been a surprise that one time. It wouldn't be a surprise anymore after that one time because you've already seen the shark one time, you've already seen what it can do, it just gets normal at that point until the movie is over. But keeping the shark ""under the table"" builds the suspense up, not ever being able to see it, but only the carnage of what it has done puts this shark as the center of attention. This film definitely played a more effective role on people that are more frightened by psychological horror, like me, not knowing when or what is going to happen but knowing at some point, it is going to happen.
My overall view on this movie is that at the time, this was an excellent horror film that played on the roles of psychological horror well through suspense, and to this day, still has the same amazing effects. I recommend this movie to anybody who has a fear of sharks, oceans, or just fear of not knowing because that is one of the biggest factors in this movie. Not being able to know what is happening to people, not being able to know what the shark is doing, not being able to know when the shark is going to attack, and not being able to know when the shark is going to stop causing havoc in the oceans of this small tourist town called Amity Island. If I had to give this film a rating off of pure enjoyment, it would definitely be an A-plus. Jaws is one of my all-time favorites and I love how it always keeps me on the edge of my seat and waiting for the next crucial moment to happen. I enjoyed this movie more than many horror films that I have watched because it wasn't just jump scares, it was the psychological work that made the horror in this film so effective. Rating the film based on horror and how effective it is, I would rate it a B. I don't believe that it would be effective to all because there weren't many jump scares, at least what I would consider a jump scare. It was mainly all suspense and psychological horror, and if you don't find that effective the movie wasn't as scary or frightening as it possibly could've been for the viewer.",

And of course Robert Shaw, Rob Schnider, and last but definitely not least Richard Dryfeuss all played there parts to well. I think I will close with the immortal of Chief Brody ( WERE GONNA NEED A BIGGER BOAT ) a 10+.",

The true entertainment of the movie is in the interaction between the three main characters.  This is one of Robert Shaw's greatest performances.  He flawlessly pulls off the scarred veteran sailor. Scheider and Dreyfuss are above average here as well, though they are pale in comparison to Shaw.  I rated this movie a 9/10, and I only failed to give it a 10 because of the horribly fake shark effects and the extremely unrealistic final ""battle"" between the shark and Scheider's character.

This movie single-handedly made millions of people fear water. You can not name another movie that generates this kind of atmosphere.

The plot is simple - A chirpy, happy sea town named Amity which is famous for it's beach-tourism faces the deadliest challenge in the form of a man-eating great white. Three people namely the Police Chief of Amity, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), a local fisherman, Quint (Robert Shaw) and a marine scientist, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) take it upon themselves to get rid of the man-eater and save Amity. Are they successful in doing so and what will be the cost they will pay defines the movie plot. The plot is simple, but Spielberg takes this weak plot to an all together different level with his direction. His efforts are supported by his special effects team without which this movie would not have been possible. The movie is not all about fear and screams, it has it's comic moments and the touchy emotional moments as well. Spielberg has mixed these emotions perfectly and the outcome is brilliant.",

Seriously, here we are facing one of our deepest fear - the bogeyman from beneath. There has been no other movie playing so perfectly on such a real fear. I live in Australia - sharks happen to take their meal on the beach every now and then.

896,22 December 2004,tom-hammond,9, Tension filled horror (with comedy),"The film as just a face value blockbuster is terrific but it has depths to it as well ,for a start it at times makes a bit of fun of the basic human fear of being eaten alive how it does that I don't know but because of this it makes it brilliant. But its not just about the shark its about 3 completely different men who don't particularly like one another having to work together as it is a basic theme of man vs nature and the terror that we as humans cant control everything . But I'm going to deep this movie is just great fun brilliant acting 3 very fine actors to my mind Robert Shaw is especially brilliant as the mad ex sailor who has a grudge against sharks ever since he was on the USS Indianapolis which was sunk and subsequently half the crew were eaten alive not surprising, and Brody as just a sheriff who has to come to terms with the fact that horrors like this do exist ,and finally Harper who has that typical Dreyfuss brash brat attitude about him who thinks that sharks are wonderful creatures and that is what makes the film so great 3 different men three different ideals one total horror linking them",

However, when the camera is positioned behind her to show the viewer Brody's expression, her veil is perfectly still. When the camera goes back to viewing her face, the veil is blowing around again. The movie is one of my favorites of all time. I think it is important to point out that in the original book Hooper and Brody's wife have an affair. If you know this, the relationship almost seems implied in the scene where Hooper comes over for dinner. I have often wondered if this was on purpose when filmed.

908,20 May 2002,fritz_fritz_,10, I'll never put on another lifejacket again...,"""Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies..."" - when I first saw Jaws, I don't even remember the crusty Robert Shaw saying those words, in fact I hardly remember any of the dialogue from the film.  What I do remember, though, was the incredibly frightening fin of the man-eating great white. How it used to glaze on up out of the water like a knife as the ominous thumping of John William's orchestra filled the air with horror.  That was the sign to bury your face into the pillow as the voices of panic began to increase in pitch and power. Needless to say, I was afraid, and still am to a degree, to go into the pool alone. The power and ferocity and terror of Jaws scared me to death when I was five years old, but now it remains on the top ten list of my all time favorite movies. Jaws was something of a problem for me when I was younger.  My parents would say they were going to watch Jaws on the T.V. just to get me out of the living room and into bed.  Now, when I actually sit down and watch the movie (for the thousandth time) it actually is a quite beautiful film.  The dialogue that goes on between Shaw, Schieder, and Dreyfuss is incredible. Shaw delivers an awesome performance - especially in his U.S.S Indianapollis speech.  Dreyfuss and Schieder are both funny and serious and terrified and don't know what to make of Shaw - and my feelings are that the audience doesn't either.  Shaw is not your typical hero, but he is a great character anyway. The real jewel to the film is the score, however.  John Williams, as in all his music, captures the audience in the deadly melody which is mesmirizing, beautiful, adventurous, deadly, bold, and simple all at the same time.  The chase music is especially fun to listen to, but the theme of the music is what everyone remembers. This is such an incredible movie and is not something that you see very often nowadays.  I give it a 10/10 and encourage all who have not experienced the magic of Jaws to get up and go rent it!",

As a story we have a simple plot, a shark is scared of tourists and it is necessary to hunt it in the ocean. With this premise, Spielberg manages to revolutionize the horror cinema that existed at the time, providing elements that continue to this day. The shots, the camera movements, the use of sound, the importance of music, the way to cause tension and fear are so perfectly done that it is impossible not to put this film as the mother of all subsequent films of this genre (along with some other films from that time that also set a precedent).

Though the younger set (my age group of 10-16) often scoff at the fact of a movie from the 70's, I truly think Jaws is a classic and ranks up-with the great horror/adventure films like The Exorcist, The Omen and Psycho (1960).

936,6 August 2021,prudhoeboy,10, Shaw's Jaws,"I was in high school when this film came out and did not get around to watching it until today, over 45 years after the film came out. So for me, it was basically a new movie minus modern overdone special effects. The film is an excellent summer fare thriller combing two solid film genres - horror and fish tale. The movie first takes you where you want to be anyway on a hot summer day - Martha's Vineyard (called Amity Island in the movie). So you're happy to go there despite rumors of troubled water. The dark, brooding Robert Shaw was the perfect choice as the old sea salt shark hunter with unresolved issues at sea, evoking themes from Moby Dick. One's horror palate was dished up early in the movie with the requisite stomach-turning images of unleashed shark carnage. Half way through the horror film, the movie turns into a delightful fish story thriller. It's a 2-fer. Shaw sets you up for the battle with an old shark war story so horrible that you know it had to be true using shark biologist Richard Dreyfuss as the foil. What comes next is enough to satisfy anyone's worst shark nightmare. Don't ask me what happens next, watch the movie. I might add, the movie builds suspense as good as any Hitchcock movie, but I found the character development a little thin in places, as as the worries a fisherman's wife should have. The movie A Perfect Storm did a better job in this department, but that movie came decades later. Roy Schneider did a pretty good job in the movie but I would have preferred George Clooney. That said, the movie comes in a solid 10 on the strength of the other factors. Richard Dreyfuss also did what he does best - go with the flow, give the movie some credibility, and stay out of the way.",

All scary aspects aside, this movie is directed brilliantly, but what does one expect from possibly the greatest director of our time. There have been many attempts at making a novel into a film but only a few actually accomplish. The consistency is not exact but it doesn't matter. Hooper has an affair with Brody's wife in the novel and dies in the end. The way he is brought into the film. he is too likable to die and to have an affair with Brody's wife would add irrelvance and an unneeded negativity to his character.

I really, truly regret that,"" Spielberg said during an interview. This is one of those moments when someone realises that they used the power they had for something awful; in this case the genocide of sharks as a direct result of this film. The number of large sharks in the waters east of North America declined by about 50 percent shortly after the release of this film. Pretty sure it caused damage in other parts of the world as well. Perhaps, it could've been avoided if the film had the right message, instead of demonising the entire species of sharks. When a marine biologist (who says he loves sharks) is happy to see trophies of dead animals and is excited about killing them, instead of educating people and informing them that we're a much, MUCH, bigger threat for sharks than the other way round, you know something is wrong.",

However, I still consider this an excellent movie made by the brilliant Steven Spielberg.  Robert Shaw is probably my favorite actor from those days, and his acting is always dead center.  This does make you think twice about entering the ocean, let me tell you.  The showdown with the men and the shark during the last portion of the movie is well drawn out and is able to keep audiences interested the whole way through.  I couldn't think of a better ending to the movie either.  This movie was great, and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good scare.",

As a kid, I was scared to ride Jaws at universal. Once I saw the movie, the man behind the curtain was laughable. The only thing this movie has going for it is ""the legend"" of don't go in the water, and the bloodcurdling theme music that is regarded as genius. The shark does not look REMOTELY real at all, nor does it behave like a shark in any way. Star Wars, Planet of the apes, Jurassic park, and even Alien (albeit also awful)...all used fiction. WHY use an actual living creature and portray it as just a shark that really hates certain boats? The acting is a joke, check out the rest of their ""BIG roles"". Megalodon is more accurate than this...because it's not a real creature that people swim with in the sea daily! There is no reason a shark would ever behave this way, and clearly the question asked was ""could a shark potentially hit a boat?""...yes? Ok movie made! I'm just glad I'm not the only one that doesn't see anything genius about this movie!",

948,1 May 2016,shriaarushi,10, Feedback for The Jaws(1975),"I have always rejoiced watching the movie The Jaws (1975). It is very nerve wracking to watch The Jaws. I appreciate the work done. Every minute catches the eyes of the production that something is going to happen. Truly touched my nerves, and sometimes I was in tears. The direction is stupendous. The Jaws as the name implies, a thriller can't supersede any Shark movie. I marveled at the glimpse of the way the shark attacks it's prey. The predator reminds me of the food chain. The food chain is significant because the shark feeds on human beings. It leaves the spectator heart-broken and maybe in tears. However, then the conscious reminds us that the big fish will feed on it's inferior. This is yet another symbol that the superior will dominate over the inferior and no matter what has been said that showing others as inferior is only for the cowards, juxtaposes many beliefs. Hence, in reality the superior is really a superior. The vicious circle that the stronger will hunt for the weaker continues. I am humbled to write a review for the movie. It is honorable to be a part of the review for The Jaws (1975). I have rated it ten on ten.",

No denying that. John Williams is the best to ever do it. The Jaws theme is a pop culture icon. Unfortunately, aside from that and one well timed jump scare, I didn't like much else about this film. I found the acting to be very dry. The greedy politician has no depth. The boat captain is a caricature. Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Scheider were ok at best. I didn't love all of the camera work. The daytime shots looked really good, but I thought that the nighttime shots were distractingly bad. They all looked like color and brightness corrected day time shots.

The opening scene in Jaws is, hands down, the most guttural, frightening scene in the history of cinema. Unlike other horror/thriller films before or after, Jaws delivers elements of adventure, politics and humor. Spielberg will always remain a genius because of this movie, especially for his tactic of not really showing us the ""monster"" until 2/3's into the film. Brody, Quint and Hooper's unique triangular relationship is another trademark of this entertaining film.

But Steven Spielberg's 1975 film adaptation of the 1974 book Jaws, prided itself on what it didn't show the audience. Although the result of mechanical difficulties, the absence of any true antagonist until the films midpoint helped catapult Jaws to cult classic status.

964,8 November 2010,johnno74,10, Fun under the sun,"The 3rd film to be released by Mr Steven Spielberg, the king of the cinema, Jaws is arguably the best . When Jaws was released, it became a worldwide hit, bringing fear to the audience about swimming in the ocean, as shown by the tag-line 'Don't go in the water' and a poster displaying a simple image of a woman swimming on the surface of the sea and a fierce looking creature at the bottom about to eat the woman. The synopsis; on a vacational island, a number of swimmers are dragged in the ocean by an underwater monster and it falls to police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider (The French Connection)), shark expert Matthew Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss (Close Encounters Of The 3rd Kind, Always)) and working class fish hunter Sam Quint (Robert Shaw (From Russia With Love)) to destroy the creature once and for all. Unusual for the horror genre due to the summery setting, Jaws depicts a truly haunting view on vacations by the sea and the scenes with Hooper swimming underwater will shock the daylights out of every film watcher who watches the film. Jaws is also highly recommended for anybody who has not seen it, because it covers the following messages; Do not swim on your own, do not swim late at night and sharks can see colors very easily.",

973,10 September 2015,Zachary-gorman,6, Jaws,"Probably the most inspired piece of casting in the movie is the use of Richard Dreyfuss as the oceanographer. He made this film soon after playing the driven, scheming, overwhelmingly ambitious title character in ""The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz,"" and the nice kid, college-bound, in ""American Graffiti."" Here he looks properly young, engaging, and scholarly, and introduces the technical material about sharks in a way that reinforces our elemental fear of them. Which brings us to the shark itself. Some of the footage in the film is of an actual great white shark. The rest uses a mechanical shark patterned on the real thing. The illusion is complete. We see the shark close up, we look in its relentless eye, and it just plain feels like a shark. ""Jaws"" is a great adventure movie of the kind we don't get very often any more.

To tell the truth i don't remember the first time I watched it but i only remember the first time I watched it- I was a small kid and I enjoyed it for then. I hardly remembered anything of the movie until again I saw it 8 years later on AXN! Now I have the DVD with me. I liked many things about the movie- 1.) The shark's death. 2.) The excitement when Chrissie Watkins was to be going attacked by the shark. 3.) Brody's steadiness(every cop should be like him) 4.) ""Smile you sonofabitch"" 5.) ""Farewell and Adaeu"" 5.) Quint's sense of humour 6.) Hooper's great laughter 7.) Brody's Glassess(lol) 8.) Quint's upright character and sharp nose Well, I could only suggest a thing for this movie: It could at least have some features as the novel. I think I'll be writing a remake to Jaws. In it Quint would die but not kiled by the shark. It will be like this: Quint will try to attack the shark for the last time it appears. A rope would be attached to the harpoon(Quint's weapon to attack the shark) and by chance the rope would tie around him and he would be throwed down into the water and there he would drown to death. AnD in case of the shark's death it would be like this: Brody would be left alone and he would try to swim as best as he can and the shark would be rushing towards him and just then he would blow off the monster's head in the same method he did in the movie. And Hooper would be killed by the shark and he would be a villain-trying to get Brody's wife from Brody.

This movie is more than well directed. The main characters are all variations of realistic reactions to the same situation, a brutal shark attack, even the mayor's careless reaction can be compared to other real-life reactions. The shark is probably the most terrifying non-human horror villain. The jump scares are actually scary and the of the shark's victims, submerged in blood and water, as their slowly killed are traumatizing enough.

Perhaps it's the CGI day of film that makes it even better today. A modern remake would be the worst decision in movie history. It's why you make The Meg instead. The 1st summer blockbuster.,
995,23 July 2018,parkerrodney,8," Great movie, but not the social commentary of the book","I remember very clearly seeing the movie Jaws when it was released in the summer of 1975. I was 15 years of age and had read the book and gave a verbal report on it in the 10th grade. Having seen the movie dozens of times since, as it is permanently recorded on my DVR, it is hard to be critical of a movie and performances that I love, but in the case of Jaws, because we love it so, we must accept so of its shortfalls, and give significant deference to Peter Benchley's book Jaws, which is an entirely different animal. So, I struggle with whether it is fair to review of movie juxtaposition to the book. Moreover, I question the fairness of reviewing movies some 40 some odd years later. The answer to that question I believe is a definite yes, because often movie goers who have read the book say that the book is better. Moreover, movies and books reflect sociological issues between and within groups and are studied in colleges and universities in various curriculum. Also, readers and movie goers often look to see how closely the movie follows the book. In the case of Jaws, if you are really into writing, screenplay development, reading books and how social issues get lost in movie translation, I suggest that you first read the book. Study it actually. The clear references to class, economics, politics, race, sex and fear clearly were intentional by the writer, who knows the purpose of his metaphors, and yet whose social commentary does not make it to the big screen with the same passion or clarity. Jaws the movie is great entertainment and absolutely incredible cinematography, acting and directing. However, the movie lacks the social commentary thrust intended by the book. If you really are a fan of this movie, read the book, the cliff notes and other critical analysis of the book. Then you will be a true Jaws fan appreciating the brilliance of both the book and the movie. Books are not just books, and movies are not just movies. Both frequently contain messages and commentary. Movies that water down books by omitting, softening and re-scripting events may still be good, but a significant message gets lost, and can only lead to inaccurate reviews and assessments.",

It had its moments, but it was overlong, and the ending was kind of abrupt. Doesn't come CLOSE to being one of the greatest films ever made - in fact it has a kind of ""TV Movie"" feel to it, albeit a very expensive one.",

1004,18 May 2007,spacefoo,10, The Greatest Movie of all time.,"Steven Spielberg's finest film is Jaws , which is saying something considering he's probably the greatest director that ever lived. Jaws is not simply a monster movie, it goes right in to the heart of an island community Amity Island, which is terrorised by a man -eating shark which staked its claim in the friendly waters of a New England island community. ",
1005,21 September 2006,acavina,9, Not for the faint of heart,"This is the greatest shark movie of all time. The deaths in this movie are very grizzly and brutal, but hey, what would you expect from a shark? The acting is superb, the music is powerful, the fear is sudden and unexpected. It's like Jurassic Park, but with sharks. I know the shark looks really fake at some points of the movie, but still just the excitement and tension going on makes you forget that. And it's not just some mindless horror movie about a hark attacking people, it's much deeper than that. It's a movie about self-conscious, doing what is right, and not succumbing to peer pressure. A very quick overview of the story would be: The Chief of Police on Amity Island is struggling to keep the beaches safe from a large shark, but the Mayor insists that they stay open for the tourists. It's got a lot of ties into other subplots, but it still comes down free of any confusion. This is one of the best films by Steven Spielberg.",

1007,22 September 2007,tom_eijk,10, Jaws,Jaws was one of the original summer movie blockbusters and an amazing thriller. Cause even know I still think it is a great movie and that's almost 33 years later. For me it really made me fear and respect sharks but then again I was pretty young when I first saw it nevertheless it is a movie with great acting. I also think it was amazing that they managed to make the movie while the fake shark didn't work until the movie was nearly done. I think you could really see that the people in the movie all wanted other things and I thought it was funny that our hero was scared of water and that he had to save the day meant facing his biggest fear. So I would recommend this movie if u haven't seen it already then.. well I can't find the words but just go and see it.,
1008,18 September 2012,Philippe277,10, The blockbuster of all blockbusters,"This is the film that epitomizes the word ""blockbuster"".

1009,25 July 2013,alienjm,10, Best Thriller Ever Made,"Jaws was the first frightening film I saw when I was a kid, at that age, it gave me a lot of nightmares. Is an important and very special movie for me, it contains the best scariest speech in cinematic history: The story of U.SS Indianapolis that is related by Quint (Robert Shaw), this scene is an instant classic, is one of my favorite scenes of all time, but the truth is that after seen the movie, I made a presentation of various shipwrecks and one of theme was the Indianapolis, I related the story of the Indianapolis and I spoke like Robert Shaw, in a moment I thought that I was him, an iconic character for me and, of course an iconic and symbolic scene. Jaws have also memorable scary scenes, Sheyder and Dreyfuss do a great job but the hero for me is Shaw, probably his best role. Another important thing is the soundtrack, the main theme is considered an absolute classic by all. It the was the first time that a soundtrack caused so many fear and panic to people of getting in the water, that means that Spielberg did his job. Jaws is a masterpiece that you can't get tired of see it.",
1010,3 July 2012,therersadaly,10, My Favorite Movie Of All Time,"What happens when a giant great-white shark starts munching on swimmers in a small coastal town? A blockbuster!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this movie!!!! I think it is the best movie of all time!!! Jaws was a original and exciting novel that became an jaw-dropping thrill-ride of a movie from start to finish. It should have way won more than just 3 Oscars!!!! With its thrilling and terrifying script, excellent special effects, and amazing cast and crew, Jaws was easily an instant classic. The astonishing Robert Shaw gives a legendary performance as Ouint, the fearless shark hunter. Roy Schieder gives one of the greatest performances ever!!! The wonderful Richard Dreyfuss is magnificent as Matt Hopper. Together, the make the best trio of all time. Steven Spielberg did a more than fantastic job directing this masterpiece. Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb did the best adaption of a novel ever. John Williams score is scary and unforgettable. Every who made this should have been given an award, even the extras!!!!! Jaws successfully combines horror, action, and drama into an original, suspenseful thriller that keeps you at the edge of your seat and out of the water.",
1011,20 August 2015,niallh20,10, I for one am never going back in the ocean!,"If you ever are in the water and hear the haunting Jaws score, You should get out as fast as you can. John Williams orchestrated one of the most well known and referenced scores of all time. But that is not only the great thing about this movie. Often regarded as the first summer blockbuster ""Jaws"" provides a tale of horror and survival which is most notably shown during the final act. The dialogue is to the point and doesn't stretch out. The cinematography is wonderful as we are shown the white sandy beaches of Amity Island. My favorite shot is of Chief Brody looking out to the ocean after an attack on some locals. That shot embodied the vast space if ocean the Chief was about to enter. This is definitely my favorite movie with fantastic performances by our three leads: Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Schneider as Quint, Hooper and Brody. Shaw steals the movie in one particular scene where he provides a dark speech full of imagery. I don't want to spoil it. This film would not have worked without a fantastic crew, great script, actors and Mr Steven Spielberg who has gives imagination and adventure to the audience. It looks like I am gonna need a bigger boat to finish this review",
1012,20 May 2022,gameofthronesandme,8, Masterpiece,"I don't think there is a movie that will show the realism of the shark movement and its appearance like this timeless masterpiece. Everything in the movie is really taught from the music and camera movement. We note that the movie has no useless conversations, all conversations that go to the core, also there is no boring character from the characters
And the way to kill the shark is really beautiful, and the moment the shark eats its victims is amazing
This movie is one of the timeless masterpieces.",

It needs no introduction. It fulfills all the requirements of a great scary movie: a phenomenal score, a great cast, a well-written story and a frighteningly relatable premise to boot. It builds tension and dread in a flawless manner and keeps up the mystery throughout a good portion of the film. Few other movies in existence have affected the subconscious of the human population as this one has.

1021,19 January 2014,offbroadway-901-432568,1, I Hated It!,"I really hated this movie. I'm sorry I know I am definitely in the minority here, but I have to be honest and I really don't see what so many people see in this movie. Maybe it's because I only just saw this now and movies get worse over time? I know my mom and dad liked the movie and actually thought it was scary, but I just thought the whole thing was boring. OK so there's this shark and it's huge and it's terrorizing a beach community in New York. Great, so that should be scary except we never really see the shark (I know people will say that's what is scary is that we don't even see it especially for the first attack and that's supposed to somehow make it more terrifying, but the truth is they just couldn't get the shark to work so they shot around it, and I found it to be about a zero out of ten on the scary scale), and then when we do finally see the shark it's a total joke! It looks so incredibly fake and moves around almost not at all and looks very awkward and unreal. The only part that was cool at all was the captain fighting the shark to the bitter end. Richard Dreyfuss hiding at the bottom of the ocean from the shark was also stupid, just so they could avoid the sadness of seeing him die? Dumb. I read the book and it was great but this movie is just boring. Very predictable ending too with how they took out the shark.",
