0,3 December 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, It's not a GUY'S film only,"Without a doubt this movie is probably the best coming of age flick around, it has terrific acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout the whole film. I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When you're a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there's that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident.",/
1,2 April 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,10, One of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story ever.,"Stand By Me is yet another one of the stories made into a movie from the author who has had more stories made into movies than any other author in history, Stephen King. Clearly, the central character here is Gordie Lachance, from whose point of view the story is told and who obviously symbolizes King himself, given many of his characteristics as well as some of the content of the film. This movie is literally filled with actors who have achieved varying degrees of success over the years, such as Jerry O'Connell, who played Vern, River Phoenix, who could have been bigger than Leonardo DiCaprio if he hadn't died, Corey Feldman, who has grown into an unenviable but visible existence, Kiefer Sutherland, who has become an excellent and very well known actor, John Cusack can be seen in a small role as Gordie's late brother, and of course, Richard Dreyfuss, who played the narrator and Gordie as an adult, has remained famous but originally achieved fame more than a decade before Stand By Me was filmed or the original story was even written.",r

4,10 August 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10, Unforgettable,"I saw Stand By Me yesterday for the first time in one and a half years, (I'm 17) and I absolutely loved it, and it is definitely one of my favourite Stephen King adaptations. I will say I absolutely loved Shawshank Redemption, and despite the fact that it was unfaithful to the book, and badly flawed, I liked It too.",i
5,5 July 1999,Peach-2,10, A small masterpiece.,"Growing up isn't easy for anyone. There are times when you feel no one understands you at all. Although growing up is tough, the friends you have at a young age are the friends you'll remember for the rest of your life. Stand By Me is a very wonderful film, a masterpiece on a small scale. The film is full of great insights into the minds of a group of four boys who decide they want to see what a dead body looks like, and it sparks their interest even more that they actually knew this dead person. A young boy's mind is full of many things, they feel lost sometimes, strong at others, but mostly they feel invinceable. Rob Reiner has directed a film about four young boys who discover life is quick, sometimes merciless, and magical. I've seen this film numerous times and it always seems better than the time before. This is a perfect little film.",e

8,9 December 2004,yummyballerina,10, This classic film is worth a watch!,"This film is a brilliant, well-acted masterpiece! What touched me the most was the late River Phoenix's acting, but all of the young actors performances were incredible. They are why you should see this film. 'Stand By Me' is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film; it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coated manner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago and was blown away by it's style and acting. It is rare that you see such fresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this film offered. Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiring film that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywood often gives us. I give this film a 100+ and recommend it to everyone. You will benefit from it's message and it's wonderful acting.",r
9,8 March 2000,Jason-228,10, Inspiration,"As a lover of Stephen King's writing style and Rob Reiner's directing techniques, this movie leaves me speechless every time. It is an almost forgotten film about a time and a youth nearly forgotten, as well. And I will say, as a writer, the novella that this film was based upon, ""The Body"" has and always will be the inspiration for my style of writing.",w
10,12 July 2019,bkoganbing,9, Superb film making,"Interesting that in Stand By Me the four kids who were our protagonists in the

11,30 October 2017,claudio_carvalho,8, Another Nostalgic Little Gem from the 80's,"In 1959, in Castle Rock, Oregon, the boys Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell) learn that the teenager Ray Brower, who is missing, was hit by a train and is dead in a nearby river. They decide to find the body to become local heroes and along their journey, they disclose secrets and learn the importance of their friendship.",2
12,10 July 2005,thegreenbiker,10, Four boys go on a quest to find not only a dead body the true meaning of friendship and reality.,"Hands down this is my favorite movie. (With the Sandlot in second place). My mom got this movie for me when i was about 12. I saw it the first time and realized that i had friends like that. The movie is definitely one every teenage kid should see. I think it is more of a movie for boys but girls can get out of it the same as the boys can. But the movie overall is great because its just about a four friends who have no experience with the ""real world"". They find out about a dead body and go in search to find it. At first they just do it to be famous and get a reward. But the quest of the boys throughout the movie reveal things that even themselves didn't know about. After it all, the boys find out about reality, and how it isn't glamorous. They realize that the body could of been them and they respect that. In my opinion the point of the movie was not to have you think of when you were 12 and your good friends but to think of what you have now, and what you do with it. In the end Gordie tells us what happens to each and how each kind of go their separate ways. (Such as the last scene of the movie). This is definitely a movie to not only rent but buy. I tip my hat to Reiner.",3
13,14 May 2015,Leofwine_draca,7, Coming-of-age drama from the pen of Stephen King,"There's a certain irony that one of the most mature films to come from the pen of Stephen King is the one based on a group of kids in the 1950s. Yet this is far from a children's film, instead it's a thoroughly dark coming-of-age drama that explores what it means to be growing up in a realistically downbeat world, as childhood innocence is abandoned in favour of harsh adult reality.",7
14,18 October 2005,TOMASBBloodhound,8, The death of childhood.,"Stand By Me is probably the best film ever to come from a Stephen King story. (The Green Mile sucks, by the way.) The story is told from an adult writer's point of view as he recounts an adventure he shared with his three best friends in the waning moments of the summer before junior high school began. We see the four boys head out into the wilderness to see the dead body of a boy who was apparently hit by a train. The boys encounter bullies, other trains, leeches, vicious dogs, and many other things on their trip. And they have some pretty deep and emotional conversations along the way.",9

Some I am not a fan of. I have not read as of yet and I'm sure I will, The Body.

17,1 December 2016,Hitchcoc,10, Masterful Storytelling,"This movie has such a punch. A group of boys (culled from some of the best child actors of the time) make a gruesome discovery. How they handle it will affect them their whole lives. But the story is as much about their pasts and their connection to one another. I just wrote comments on ""The Breakfast Club."" I felt that movie lacked chemistry. While every type was represented, it just didn't cook the way this one does. Part of it is that these boys, while in some ways disenfranchised, are not open books. As they interact, their dreams and hopes are drawn from them. Some seem quite settled, but when push comes to shove, they have vulnerabilities. The stories they tell give us insight into their souls. From what has happened to some of the actors, it makes one wonder if some of that suffering came from within them. There are intense scenes. There is bragging and one- upsmanship along the way. And nothing is simple or trite. On of the best movies of our time.",/
18,8 September 2015,Vartiainen,6, Portal into childhood,"Stand by Me is based on one of my favourite Stephen King stories. It tells about a man remembering his youth in a small town where he and his three friends, all of them twelve and about to embark on different schools, decide to crown their last summer together by taking a trip down the railroad tracks in pursuit of a rumour about a dead body seen by the river. A sight that naturally appeals to the horror freaks in prepubescent boys.",?
19,28 April 2006,andreas_14_99,10, One of the best movies ever made...,"Stand By Me is without a doubt one of the finest pieces of film ever made in the history of humanity. A truly excellent movie that really strikes and affects you with all its glory. It leaves no one untouched whether you're 12 or 112 years old. Simply because it deals with life and friendship, and all that comes with it. Both the good and the bad.",r
20,26 September 2009,classicsoncall,9," ""But kids lose everything unless there's someone there to look out for them"".","I was already well beyond my formative pre-teen years when I first saw this film, but there's no denying that if you grew up in small town America, this is about as close as you get to capturing the essence of childhood friendships that remain with you forever, even after time and distance take their eventual toll. Director Rob Reiner skillfully crafts a compelling tale from a Stephen King short story, layering it with various sub-texts that run the gamut from dealing with the town bully to confronting the loss of family. What's probably most remarkable about the picture are the performances that Reiner obtains from his young starring cast, most notably River Phoenix as Chris Chambers, and Wil Wheaton as his best friend Gordie Lachance. Told through the perspective of Wheaton's character, the film conjures up memories of the many trials and tribulations one faces while growing up, often unsure of oneself and even worse, feeling alone and disoriented when personal tragedy strikes and threatens to overwhelm one's very being. Yet the story never gets maudlin or depressing, there's enough youthful camaraderie and mischief on hand to keep the adventurous foursome going strong. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell round out the group, and together they manage to grow and mature in a way that none of them could have imagined prior to starting their quest. Scored with a soundtrack that memorializes some of the great song hits from a half century ago, ""Stand By Me"" is a strange and wonderful journey, in it's own way reminding us of what might have been the best time of our lives. Sincerely.",e
21,29 December 2000,hamsun,10, This wonderful movie opens the place where your secret heart is buried,"In ancient Greece people watched the great tragedies in the amphi-theatres, and eyewitnesses tell us that audiences of 20'000 sat crying when the main character on the stage became aware of his fatal guilt and had to face death. They called it catharsis, best translated by 'cleaning the souls'. Well, measured by the tremendous effect on all of us writing reviews on the film, STAND BY ME has the power and qualities of ancient tragedy. This jewel of a film touches and shakes the best sides in us. I have watched it over and over again, and even if I watch it several times a week I still sit and laugh and cry, and it leaves me sad and confused and grateful, feelings that can last for hours and sometimes days.",f
22,27 December 2008,kenjha,5, Clichéd and Pointless,"Four boys go in search of a dead body, but it becomes a journey of discovery about themselves. The premise of the story (based on a King novella) is stupid and generally uninteresting and the execution is clichéd. Reiner seems unsure of where he wants to go with the film; it just rambles on pointlessly. There is an irrelevant interlude about a pie-eating contest filled with gross puking scenes. The characters are either stereotypes (the teens) or cartoon-like (the parents and other adults). The big emotional scenes are corny and forced. The framing device, where the story is related in flashbacks, is meant to be poignant but it just falls flat.",_

Plus, the four twelve year old protagionists are a helluva lot more likable than Holden! In other words, a damn fine film and kudos to the quartet of Phoenix, Wheaton, Feldman and O'Connell. You're lucky if you get just one fine kid actor let alone four, as is the case here. So kudos to director Rob Reiner, as well, whose best film this is and who must have had something to do with coaxing the talent from his four young leads.",t

26,24 August 2005,gracegibson,9, Great flick,"I saw this movie a few years ago and I instantly thought it was great. It's a memorable story (adapted from an unusual literary venture for Stephen King) about four 12-year-old boys in 1959 who go in search of a dead body. Everything about this movie was memorable: the script, the acting, and most of all, the four boys. All of them had distinct personalities and backgrounds and didn't blend into each other like so many other movies like this. My favorite character was Chris Chambers, who was not only cute but a ""bad boy"" with a heart of gold (also the breakout role for River Phoenix). This is a must-see for anyone who likes a good movie. The only problem I had with this movie was that I found it unrealistic. The 12-year-old boys in the movies cussed every two words, smoked cigarettes regularly, and talked admiringly in detail about some girl's boobs. I found this unusual even for 1959. I was 12 once, and most of the boys I knew rarely cussed, never smoked anything, and were just a smidge too far from puberty to talk about a girl's boobs in detail. However, these small qualities are redeemed. This is a great movie from the great Stephen King.",_

34,26 March 2003,paul2001sw-1,6, Not outstanding,"The early death of River Phoenix has given his films a posthumous lustre; but 'Stand By Me', though not without merits, is not a great film.  It gets some things right: for example, it has the courage to tell a tale of four decidedly pre-pubescent children, and while they do not necessarily make pleasant company, its a relief to see a ""rights of passage"" film not entirely shaped by a story of first love.  But the characters are disappointly archetypal: the sensitive writer, the wise gang leader, the stupid fat kid and the wild one; and the dialogue and story are at times weighed down by the burden of implied significance.  Also hard to understand is why the older boys who also appear should be quite so wound up by the film's (much younger) heroes.  The low key ending is also undermined by the sentimental wrapping provided by the narrator.  Read Roddy Doyle's novel 'Paddy Clarke Ha-ha-ha' for a less heavy handed story of children growing up by stealth.",

38,17 January 2013,cinefreakdude,2," Overrated, pretentious and annoying.","Stand By Me is a film that I consider incredibly overrated. I like quite a few of Rob Reiner's films, Spinal Tap and Princess Bride in particular. However, Stand By Me is just so pretentious and unpleasant to me, I can't find much in it to like. For child actors, the cast isn't actually too annoying, but that being said I didn't find any of the characters very likable and couldn't really get attached to them. Another thing I didn't like about this movie is that it's mean spirited. For a film about childhood, it seems to just be interested in countless instances of people hurting, destructing, bullying, etc, other people. Yes, I understand what it's going for/trying to say, but just can't get in to this overdone, pretentious movie that's not evenvery entertaining.

Coming as it does from a Stephen King story (called ""The Body""), one might assume that ""Stand by Me"" is a horror story. In fact, it is nothing of the sort. It really shows these boys slowly but surely coming of age, especially when they meet up with local hoodlum Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland). As is a recurring theme in Stephen King's stories, the boys come from rather unhappy homes, and the four of them getting together as a group is their only escape, which King also explored in ""It"" and ""Hearts in Atlantis"".",

To me the major asset of this story is its simplicity, and thank god the movie didn't try to ""improve"" on that. Actually nothing much happens, it's just four kids that take a long walk along the railroad track in search for the body of some kid that supposedly was killed by a passing train. During their trek they joke around, talk, bicker, come across some barriers and misfortunes and in the end reach their goal. But they also reach some new insights in themselves and in their friends.

The strengths and weaknesses of the script are often a direct reflection of its source (a Stephen King novella), with dialogue keenly tuned to the period (who was stronger, Superman or Mighty Mouse?), but overloaded with a superabundance of barf jokes, fart jokes, jerking off jokes, and so forth.

Maybe a lot of this comes down to its kind of unrelatable core conceit and some of the stranger twists and turns of its narrative, though the overall experience is by no means a negative one and essentially represents an easy-to-watch, well-acted meander through a distant memory. 7/10",
48,24 August 2002,Luigi Di Pilla,1, AWFUL AND TOO OVERRATED !!,"I was disappointed at the end of the film and my wife too. I didn´t think that it could end so simply. The story is very thin and lives especially from typical kid stories or adventures. The movie never gets really chilling and also the time till they find the dead body is too long. Too easy and no big surprises when finally the kids found the body. In the whole film there were one or two funny scenes but believe me that´s all. I noted this movie from imdb critics and i have to say that they are partly too overrated. Rent it before you decide to buy it. Fortunately I only rent it but you won´t miss anything and it´s better you save the money for another good DVD. For these reasons we gave for the second time a 1/10.

50,4 November 2010,johnnyboyz,7," Affectionate enough tale of four youngsters discovering all kinds of strife and truths, under a canopy of highly delicate comedy and enjoyable characterisation.","There's a point in Rob Reiner's pleasing 1985 film Stand by Me in which the primary characters themselves, in the form of four young boys of around about double figures in age, identify the trip they're all going on as anything but ""just a load of fun"" or an excuse to ""have fun"" or that they 'ought' to be having fun. Where the allure of doing something a little rebellious and sneaking off with three friends for a few days so as to visit a yet undiscovered crime scene sounded like a great time prior to taking off, it is only half way through the journeying that the real world out and away from your home does not necessarily adhere to your initial vision. In a certain sense, we feel the same way about the film: an unobtrusive and light hearted comedy about a bunch of boys breaking all the rules and having fun in the process on the surface but something much more beneath that. There is nothing funny about what the four primary child characters go through in Stand by Me, nothing funny about the realities they face nor what it is they both experience and learn as a result of what they do. Like the boys at the soul of the film itself going through what they're going through, the audience themselves are invited to take a step back and really mediate on what it is we truly think about what's transpiring before our eyes.",

Based on the short story ""The Body"", it tells the simple story of 4 friends going on a road trip to find the body of a dead kid. It's all about friendship, and loosing innocence, with a menacing Kiefer Sutherland luring with his croonies in the background. Starring some young, up and coming actors, you can't stop to think what happened to they're own future, when you watch it. The ending, were River Phoenix walks away and slowly dissapears, always make me shiver. Almost a foreboding for his tragic future. But beyond all, this is a story about the last tour for 4 friends, before they eventually split up. Just like life, you have childhood friends you share unforgettable memories with, but you just loose touch, and life goes on.",
53,5 June 2007,jboothmillard,10, Stand by Me,"Following the success of This Is Spinal Tap, Golden Globe nominated director Rob Reiner (Misery, A Few Good Men) brought out this fantastic coming-of-age drama. Based on a book called ""The Body"" by Stephen King, this film has Gordie Lachance, or The Writer (Richard Dreyfuss) looking back on his younger days when he and three close friends go on an adventure to find the body of a missing kid, presumed dead. The four characters are all lovable, including leader and best friend Chris Chambers (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade's River Phoenix), Gordie himself (Wil Wheaton), quite smart glasses wearing Teddy Duchamp (The Goonies' Corey Feldman), and large wimpy and simple minded Vern Tessio (Scream 2's Jerry O'Connell). Along the way, they encounter the junk yard owner and his legendary dog Chopper, a speeding train on a bridge they are walking on which they jump from, camp fire chats (including the hilarious Larass barfing story), crossing the lake of leeches, and ultimately, they become closer than they did before, if only it lasted. They are also being followed by older boys, trying to get their first, including hateful leader Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland). Also starring Casey Siemaszko as Billy Tessio, Gary Riley as Charlie Hogan, Bradley Gregg as Eyeball Chambers, Jason Oliver as Vince Desjardins and then quite unknown John Cusack as Denny Lachance. They do eventually find the body, but cover it back up and respect it, and all kids hardly see each other afterwards, even after their close bonds. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. River Phoenix was number 69 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Outstanding",
54,21 April 2017,sol-,6, The Stand,"Upon learning of the death of a childhood friend, a story writer recalls an adventure that they shared with two other boys when they were twelve years old in this nostalgic coming-of-age drama starring Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix as the two young friends. The chemistry between Wheaton and Phoenix feels genuine throughout and highlights of their adventure include a near miss with a speeding train, an engrossing campfire story about a pie eating contest and a leech incident. Their goal of seeing a dead body that they have heard about is pretty interesting too. This is one of those movies where the journey is more important than the destination though and it is a bit of an uneven ride with little sense of tension or urgency in the air as the boys talk about random topics such as Disney characters and food while casually making their way to where they believe the body is located. A major part of the film also involves the boys standing up their older brothers and other bigger kids, none of which is half as interesting as the way they confide in one another about their deepest fears and resentments during the course of their adventure. The final fifteen minutes or so of the film are quite intense though and one gets the sense of the boys being truly affected by their experiences, but one's mileage here will likely depend upon one's affection for nostalgia.",

When this came out I was about their age and I begged my older sister to rent it because everyone was talking about it, and she just gave me dirty looks after it was over that she spent money on the rental, and now I can fully appreciate her response. I guess it's a unique story, and we were all kids once, and nostalgia and blah blah blah, but there is nothing relatable here, nothing sticks, and not because of the story itself but because of the entire way it is acted. I know everyone is going to defend the shining honor of River Phoenix, but he's terrible here. Poorly acted by all involved.

66,9 August 2017,Bored_Dragon,8, Not what you'd expect from King,"Many claim this to be the best adaptation of Stephen King. I will refrain from such claims until I saw them all (so far I have seen 14 out of around 80), but it sure is great. The story is not a typical King, but, even if I didn't know what I'm watching, I would recognize King by the overall atmosphere. This adventure is placed at the end of the '50s, also one of King's signatures, and followed by an excellent choice of music from that period. Fans of horror, fantasy and suspense adventure may be disappointed by the lack of all, cause this movie almost has no plot and it's based on characterization and human relationships. For just an hour and a half, that summarize two days of boys adventure, we get to know those four twelve years old boys so good that we get the impression we grew up together with them. Besides King's writing and Reiner's directing, great merits for such an impression go to four boys that will soon grow up into famous actors - star of Star Trek Wil Wheaton, prematurely deceased River Phoenix (who, strangely, dies prematurely in movie too), less famous but very productive Corey Feldman (Gremlins, Goonies, voice of Donatello in TMNT), Kiefer Sutherland and lots more of more or less known faces. All in all, if you don't expect a typical King and know how to enjoy good family drama, this movie would be a shame to miss.",

Rob Reiner who directed does a fine job adapting from Stephen King's novel that's told by a grown adult who's all grown up played by Richard Dreyfuss who tells about the summer of 1959. And when the film flashes back his youth character is played by Wil Wheaton and it tells of his summer journey with his three friends(River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O' Connell)who set across the Oregon landscape of wilderness and timber to search for a dead body of a boy who's been missing. A good turn is given by Kiefer Sutherland who's tough as the local bully.

81,24 January 2021,baileycrawly,10, One of the All-Time Greatest,"Stand By Me is one of those truly special films that really only comes around once in a lifetime. Based on the novella ""The Body"" by Stephen King, Stand By Me follows a group of 4 friends who journey to find the body of a young man who has gone missing and is presumed to be dead. It's one of those stories that has a simple overarching plot, but layers it meaningful details along the way. It's not about ""the destination"" so much as it's about ""the journey.""
In this film, you'll find some of the most powerful child acting that may ever have been committed to screen, creating both a chemistry between each other and emotionally-charged scenes that deliver in the best possible way every single time. It presents a friendship that never leaves the audience wondering whether or not it's legitimate. These kids could easily have been friends for their entire lives based solely off what you see in the film. When they're happy, the audience is happy and, when the more emotional scenes come along, the audience is in on it just as much as the kids are.
The film, much like the novella it's adapted from, creates a lovable group of kids and portrays the struggles of coming to terms with mortality and the difficulties of growing up with less than supportive parents in a way that feels completely authentic.
Wil Wheaton is absolutely incredible as Gordie LaChance, a wannabe writer with a heart of gold for his friends; the late River Phoenix is absolutely the standout as the rugged street kid Chris Chambers, who was given the short end of the stick as a result of his family's name and affiliations; Corey Feldman is fantastic as Teddy Duchamp, a young boy layered with personal drama that directly plays into his conflicting character; and there's Jerry O'Connell as Vern Tessio who, despite being a really good actor that fit the part really well, comes off as the cheap comic relief character. He's not exactly the brightest in the group; he's very simple-minded. Yet together they created a great group of kids that pull you into the film and hold you there from beginning to end.
The soundtrack of this film is absolutely immaculate, drawing from classics from the likes of Buddy Holly and, of course, Ben E. King. It's an homage to a world of music we have all but forgotten in today's society, and it's really nice to look back on it. The soundtrack album of this film is truly every bit as good as the film itself.
The score is also really well done, in particular because it knows when to be quiet. It's an easy thing to slap some emotional music over more vulnerable scenes (it creates the ""emotional manipulation"" effect), but this film doesn't do that as much as it probably could've. During some of the more emotional and iconic scenes, the film doesn't have a musical score accompanying it. You just get the very natural feeling of someone opening up and expressing their feelings to a friend, and the choice to not have music and to let that happen organically was the perfect decision, in my opinion.
Stand By Me is a movie that is really meant to be experienced rather than talk about, and there isn't much I can say about it that will really do it justice, except to say that it's one of the very few movies I recommend to every single person. You need to see this at least once.",

84,21 March 2021,RonellSowes,8, Thoughtful Film Supported By First Rate Filmmaking,"Four friends go on a weekend adventure together in search of a body. A pretty simple logline. The film follows four preteen boys on their two day trek and with only a few exceptions stays on them for the 89 minute duration. The banter between them is, well, childish, but it's still entertaining. Its humorous and at times poignant. And cast members are all talented actors who make their lines work. However, I find River Phoenix definetly gives the best performance of the film. The amount of emotion and sincerity he can bring to a character at that age is remarkable. And its these deeper undercurrents that he and also his castmates can channel that makes this film. This film is what you might call 'coming of age' and is really a look at a certain stage in life. And Rob Reiner does an excellent job on conveying the particular atmosphere of this film. Everything about it from the lighting, score, design and narration adds to a certain tone and feeling to this film.
Despite the fact that its protagonists are kids Stand By Me is really made for adults. Its reminiscent of childhood(perhaps the one you wish you had)and viewing it with the hindsight of the future.",

Not only was that the day it went into wide release, it also marked my friend's 18th birthday and I suggested watching this after spending some of that day at the Fun Fair Park amusement ride area. So the place was crowded by the time the movie began. There were plenty of laughs during much of the narrative and I remember being touched by some of the more emotional scenes. I don't remember if my friend liked it as much as I did (the only time I even remember him saying anything during the picture was during the scene after Will Wheaton's character shot the gun in the air and when he pointed it at Kiefer Sutherland's bully character, my friend said, ""Kill him!""), but he must have still been in a good mood because we went bowling afterwards at Don Carter's. Anyway, I just watched it again at the Perkins Rowe Cinema today-since it's celebrating its 35th anniversary this year, it was only playing at 7:00 this evening-and it's even better than ever! I mean, besides Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, and River Phoenix are aces as the four near-teen boys on their journey to find a dead body who was close to their age. And Kiefer was sure very effective as the bully, wasn't he? And kudos to Rob Reiner for truly understanding what it's like to feel so insecure while growing up with not-so-perfect livelihoods. Stephen King was so touched, he considered this one of the best of films adapted from his work. So, yes, I very highly recommend Stand By Me. P. S. When just watching this right now, I could've swore that one of the bullies surrounding Kiefer was also one of the bullies that surrounded Thomas F. Wilson's Biff Tannen in the first Back to the Future during that movie's '50s sequence. Sure enough, that bully that was in both this and BTTF was one Casey Siemaszko!",

I grew up largely afraid, alone, friends came and go and for a little while there I had a small group of close friends I really enjoyed spending time with. We all ended up at different schools, in different lives, with very different opinions, and many different preferences. There probably won't be a time where we all stand in the same room again, but I have those memories- and nothing has ever captured that bittersweet feeling more than this movie. People, especially adults, never truly realize how lonely it can be being a kid- and its heartbreaking to see that this is the same throughout 3 completely separate generations.

It is based on Stephen King's novella The Body. It stars Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell. Each has had a decent career following this movie. Unfortunately, Phoenix died at a young age. He was a genuine talent. This was one of my favorite movies when I was a child. I still watch it here and there, when the mood hits, or the internet is down. It's definitely one to have a copy lying about. The chemistry of the characters engross you into a story of friendship, the kind you miss over the years. These boys are on that cusp of being a child, and becoming a teenager. I possessed the luxury of seeing this as a child, so I will always relate. I strongly suggest this film for parents of children at that age. But it's not just for them.

Directed by Rob Reiner, this film tells the story of four 12-year old boys living in a tranquil town of Castle Rock, Oregon in the late 50s: Gordie Lachance (played by Wil Wheaton), a sensitive kid who faces disillusion by his father after the death of his older brother Denny and thus, feels lonely at home; Chris Chambers (played by River Phoenix), a tough, but peace-loving boy who is labeled by many as a bad kid after he was caught stealing milk money at school, and is plagued by guilt after since the incident; Teddy Duchamp (played by Corey Feldman), a flamboyant young man with abusive, war veteran father who once held his son's ear to the stove, requiring him to wear an ear piece; and Vern Tessio (played by Jerry O'Connell), a down-to-earth and overly cautious kid who also deals with a rude older brother. These preteens spend their summer in a tree house playing cards, smoking, and telling tall tales, until they hear the news about a dead kid their age gone missing after being hit by a train. So the four boys set out on a quest in search of him with nothing standing their way but a gang of older kids lead by bully Ace Merrill (played by Kiefer Sutherland).

Expect a simple story that is well executed in the traditional Hollywood mold but it is far away from being a truly powerful film and a realistic portrayal of childhood. In fact, the kids in the film look more like adults or kids playing adults in a movie, than actual kids.

127,20 February 2014,zardoz-13,10, Still Standing!!!,"Rob Reiner's ""Stand By Me"" qualifies as a great movie. The Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans screenplay is thoughtful, introspective, but appropriately melodramatic, with memorable dialogue. Reiner and his writers know when to swerve from comic hijinks to dramatic predicaments. Squeamish spectators who abhor profanity should be prepared for some naughty words. The film benefits from strong casting, with Kiefer Sutherland as a superb villain. The quartet of kids—River Phoenix, Will Wheaton, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell—are likable enough characters etched with enough quirks to make them interesting. They learn where a dead body--Ray Brower—can be located near a river and take a walk through the woods to get it. Meanwhile, Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland) and his cronies take their cars. Mind you, ""Stand By Me"" is a coming-of-age story about troubled youth. Gordie Lachance (Will Wheaton) feels guilty about the death of his older brother Denny (John Cusack) who excelled at football. Denny was the apple of his father's eye. During a nightmare, Gordie dreams that his father told him that he should have died. Chris Chambers (River Phoenix) is the never-do-well kid, and his big brother runs with Ace. Reiner doesn't wear out our patience with his skillful adaptation of Stephen King's novella ""The Body."" Reiner relates his yarn from Gordie's perspective. Like all flashback tales, this one has an older actor (Richard Dreyfuss) reminiscing about his past. The semi-sort of happy ending is both downbeat and solemn. Definitely worth watching with several good scenes, like Ace running a truck off the highway during a chicken race, the railway bridge crossing, and the leech scene in the river with our quartet of heroes, stand out.",

132,27 March 2006,dethrow_drew,9, The Time of Their Lives,"The movie Stand by Me is a story about four close twelve year old friends growing up in rural Oregon who are bitten by the curiosity bug. The main Character, Gordie (Wil Wheaton), and his three friends, Chris (River Pheonix), Teddy (Corey Feldman), and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) set out on an adventure to find the body of Ray Brower. They had heard of his whereabouts by Vern's older brother and they were determined to find him. They incur many setbacks during their journey. They are bullied by the older boys of the town who are also trying to find the body and get the fame, attacked by the junkyard dog Chopper, almost getting run down by a train, and attacked by the swamp leaches. The boys learn many lessons on their journey, but more importantly they learn about life. The actual goal of Rob Reiner, director of the film, was to show that growing up has its ups as well as downs. All four of the main characters have had some trouble in their life. He showed this when Gordie's athletic brother was tragically killed in a car accident. By doing this, Reiner elaborates to the audience that bad things do happen to the best people. Chris and Teddy also have very neglecting fathers at their homes. Even though it is all fun and games on the hunt for the body, they still have a troubled life lingering in the background that they can not get away from. And good old Vern has an older brother who wreaks havoc in his life. He is actually one of the older bullies also on the hunt for the body. Reiner cannot make his point much clearer. One of the things I really loved about this movie is how few rules the young twelve year old boys had. The first evident thing is when the movie opens and they are smoking in their tree house. These boys smoke, shoot handguns in town, and cuss like sailors throughout the movie and know one seems to notice. Wow, the times sure have changed since I was a young child.",

134,10 March 2010,Aaron1375,9, Good buddy picture.,"I do believe the title of the story from which it came was ""The Body"", they instead named it ""Stand by Me"". Probably a wise decision as if it was named ""The Body"" anyone who was familiar with Stephen King, but not this particular story would automatically assume this was a horror movie. No, it is a coming of age type tale, a sort of buddy travel story on a smaller scope than other travel movies as these are kids and while they walk a fair distance they do not really go cross country or anything. The premise of the movie is that four friends are going along the train tracks in search of the body of a boy who was hit by a train I believe. During their travels they have their hardships, breakdowns, and very funny moments as well. The actors are all great, a lot of young talent though looking back now the best one was most likely River Phoenix who passed away I believe shortly after ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"". I also enjoyed his performance in that movie although it was brief and I also enjoyed his performance in an earlier film ""Explorers"". Wil Wheaton I have not really seen in many movies since, I know he was in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and I believe he writes for shows too, though I am not 100 percent sure of that. Feldman was also good in this, but he was actually a good actor, I think he just got typecast to much later in life where he and Corey Haim were in a lot of movies together. Both good actors, but I think they probably damaged each others careers by all the films they starred in together in a rather short span of time. This film is good though and I usually like a travel film. There are some issues though as I am just unsure of the gang led by Kiefer Sutherland as they seemed a rather strange addition to the film. I just do not see why they would even bother trying to find the body as if they did I am sure local authorities would probably pin the death on them. Still, Kiefer did a nice job as the sort of villain of the movie. All in all a good movie about kids who while on a trip to find something at the end discover some stuff about themselves and each other.",

I guess it's difficult to explain why I love this film so much, I've basically grown up with it, I saw it for the first time when I was about ten years old and I have seen it so many times since because it is so good. The story is touching and true and real -- about the kind of friends you have when you are a kid, when those ""best friends"" are your world. This is without a doubt the best adaptation of a Stephen King story to date (together with The Shawshank Redemption). It's a very engrossing film, very funny, but also very sad. I especially like the two scenes with John Cusack. The four young leads are all brilliant, but ever since I saw it for the first time River Phoenix's performance is the one that has touched me the most. I really don't know how to put my feelings about this film into words so I'll just say: ""Stand by Me"" is brilliant, if you haven't seen it I feel sorry for you. (9/10)",

We never went on a trip to find a dead body, but hey, nothing ever happened around here, so we did what we could. I think it's a shame that certain groups of people won't ever understand this film, because they've never run around in a field playing Cowboys or Soldiers or had tea parties with the girls or any of the other things kids used to do, before technology and the need to grow up so quickly.

I enjoyed the story and looked forward to seeing the movie- but what I wasn't prepared for was the Emotional Impact the movie would have on me. When I walked out of the theater, my legs were weak. I went to my car and got in and sat behind the wheel for a long time thinking about the guys I'd grown up with. Most of them were dead or in jail by then (or should've been), but they'd been my FRIENDS and remembering them that evening, I couldn't help but break down. Sure, the movie is stylized and the dialogue retains that ""Bradbury"" feel, but STAND BY ME is one of those rare movies that (at least for me) sticks with you long after you've seen it. It's hard to watch because of the memories it dredges up, but I still see it whenever I can because sometimes, no matter how much it hurts, it's good to Remember.",

And this was a mature take on the transformation from adolescence to teenager. The story seems quite realistic and almost everything is beautiful. What I did not like was the typical acting by American youngsters that often seems unrealistic and challenging to normal human behavior. Like the confrontation between elder group of kids and those younger generation in the middle of the woods showed that those elder teenagers look quite reckless and boasting enough to show their pseudo-manliness. In the flip side the maturity portrayed by those young kids is phenomenal. That makes the film just beautiful. A film that can be watched multiple times.",

Like him, i like having adventures and i have also covered a corpse (mine was a dead cat in a decrepit hospital for which we got troubles with parents !!!).

It is perfectly cast, wonderfully written and directed brilliantly by Reiner at the top of his game. It shows River Phoenix at his best and only illustrates what a loss he was to the movie business. King is difficult to adapt as a rule because his stories are often based on a supernatural premise which never quite works on film in the way it always works in the books. Stand by Me was a short story (called The Body) in the book Different Seasons, which was my introduction to King and began my love for his writing. It also had Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption as one of the four excellent stories. Kiefer Sutherland also appears in this terrific movie as does Richard Dreyfuss though their parts are small.

Evans, ensure that the first half of the film is not quite as electrifying as one might have hoped, as it is clear that some sequences are ultimately far better off than others.With the boys ' attempts to cross the railway bridge securely within the opening hour of the film, surely standing as a highlight.

I truly believe this is one of the best movies to have ever been mad, with comedy, drama and thriller this movie is intoxication of different genres, and the plot really sets up, if they are true friends and this coming of age movie really brings in the reality of how friends come and go. Gordie has such a sad story, but can be realistic when parents drift away after the loss of a child. Verne struggles to find his buried change, and while doing so hears from a few older kids that they maybe a dead body, that has came off the train tracks after been hit.

This gem captures that feels that you only get when you are a kid that feels that you share with your friends. On that level the film is absolutely funny with all the little details that represent the different personalities of the four boys, the four friends Gordie (Will Wheaton), Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman) and Vern (Jerry O'Connell). In the beginning of the film Gordie introduce us his friends saying for example that Chris is the leader of their gang and also his best friend but with the journey we are going to know much more about these kids and a fine example can be the reaction after hearing Gordie's story about Lard-Ass, with the most curious reaction being the one of Vern (you will see why), or also a wonderful scene where you see both Gordie and Chris talking about more serious things and suddenly we move to the talk between Teddy and Vern with both talking about mighty mouse and Superman (Teddy: ""Superman's a real guy""). It is just an absolute adventure, a total kids adventure, and the ""objective"" could have been easily another but at the same time going to see a dead body is a perfect way to show kids' big curiosity and also is absolutely funny to watch how they imagine the fact that they can be in the news being again the reaction of Vern the most unique, you know worrying about their hairs. In other level it is moving and sad to see how this little boys are already thinking about problems that are not indicated to be a charge when you have 12 years old or so but are quite common. Of course everything relies upon the family and in the end it is a great family what seems to have Gordie or maybe is better to call him Stephen.",

It's rock solid basically - here the well-observed King gang-of-lads dynamic gets centre stage without any of the creepy stuff.

Stephen King is a phenomenal fiction writer and his novels Salem's Lot, It, The Shining, and, of course, Stand By Me, all of them being a film as well, scared the crap out of me while the film I am reviewing now, offered a sense of nostalgia and happiness mixed with a variety of emotions . It has been reported that Stephen King cried after seeing this film because it is the closest adaptation ever to one of his novels and I have to agree to that. Rob Reiner will be remembered as the man who made Stephen King cry and also for making a perfect piece of film making that will be remembered as long as humanity is in existence. The performances from Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell were the best in the whole film and not one of them I mentioned have ever stepped out of line or have made mistakes. The bad actors were Kiefer Sutherland, his bad boy acting was uncool and uncomfortable, and his whole stupid gang. They looked crap and acted sh*t. Pardon my French! The best character in the film was Vern because his humor, appearance, and his stupidity was enough to set the screen on fire. Hot! Hot! Now look at him, all bone and serious! Yuck! To be honest, I was expecting a boring old-fashioned film that would be in the bottom 100 but, boy, was I wrong. I loved it so much that it belongs in my personal top 100. The other lovely thing about this is the nostalgia it offered and it was one of the reasons why this earned a straight ten from me. I was about nine when I watched this and couldn't understand most of it but three years later after watching it again, I loved it!

Overall though this movie turned out well definitely one of the better Steven King adaptations. The acting was great from everyone which you don't usually find out of child actors, River Pheonix and Will Wheaton exspecially gave great performances.",

The plot itself is simple; four friends early in their adolescence set out on a journey to find a dead body. However, along the way they discover more about themselves than they could have imagined. Or rather, the two main friends discover things about themselves, mainly through reinforcement from those around them.",

207,20 August 2016,ofpsmith,10, A memorable childhood experience.,"I haven't read ""The Body"", the novella this movie was based on, but the film very much impressed me. It's 1959. Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton) and his friends Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman), and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell) are following the story of Ray Brower, a boy who vanished while picking berries. Vern overhears his older brother Billy Tessio (Casey Siemasko) talking about finding Brower's body, so he tells his friends and the four of them decide to go looking for him. Meanwhile Billy tells his friends about Brower's body as well, and the leader of the gang, John ""Ace"" Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland) decides to search as well. Along the we we learn several things about each of the characters and they learn things about each other. Gordie loves writing stories and telling stories, but is largely ignored by his parents who are grieving the death of Gordie's older brother Denny Lachance (John Cusack), whom Gordie idolized. Chris's family are largely made up of criminals and alcoholics, and thus people see Chris as merely another link in his family's chain. Teddy's dad suffered from fits and rage after returning home after World War 2, and burned both of Teddy's ears. And Vern is constantly teased for his weight and bullied by Billy. Eventually the group finds Brower's body, but then Merrill's gang shows up. After a confrontation, both groups decide to leave without Brower. The child actors are all great, and the characters are so real that I've met someone like each one of them throughout my life (personally, I think I'm like Gordie). Not to mention, the soundtrack is fantastic. I'm listening to Ben E King as I write this now. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and check it out.",

'Gol darn you!' was mostly what I heard, with the occasional 'Dang!' and sometimes, under extreme duress, 'Dammit!' So, a possibly great story in STAND BY ME was demoted to just a good story because of the inaccuracy of the language and perversity. All in all, don't miss this one.

215,16 March 2013,PeterMitchell-506-564364,9, Stand by this one with it's great and irreplaceable acting foursome,"Stand By Me is one of those films with some really unforgettable moments, a few of them, cherished ones by four young actors who are so impressive in their roles, we're taken aback, by just how good they really are. The most obvious being a young gifted actor who died way young before his time. 10 something, Vern, a younger Jerry O'Connell, a fatty here (yes, the same guy, whose ordinary looks shot up, making him a romeo sort, later on) overhears a conversation about a dead body by some local thugs, while scrounging for cash underneath the porch of his house. He rushes back to tell his friends, and so begins a two day adventure to locate the body of a missing teen. Ideally this movie is one about the joys of friendship, where along the way they encounter adversity, home truths, imaginative stories, while also nearly getting run down by a train, on a tall bridge, that proved quite a hairy moment. And too we had that lake/leech scene, one of them getting inside Jerry's drawers. The fat kid story told in great visual flashback was another of the treats in this fine film, plus bad and abused kid, Teddy, an excellent Feldman, who spits water in Vern's ear. When seeing Phoenix in this, and seeing him in later films, he seemed so different or he had grown up really quick. He's the best buddy of the other kid, Wil Wheaton through which this simple story and those imaginative ones are told. Wheaton's star should of shone brighter when judged by this performance, where he was really the only one who lucked out, later on as an actor. And now to put a rain on their damper, are the thugs in a convertible out to track down the body too, headed by Sutherland, who likes to smash a row of letter boxes with his baseball bat. The film's flow never bores or disappoints, and we learn things we wish we didn't about some of these poor kid's childhoods. Richard Dreyfuss as an older Wheaton adds a nice touch at the start, reminiscing, when reading one of the tabloids involving murdered best friend, Phoenix, while he returns at the end, in front of a computer screen, the author at work. The end where there's a standoff between the two groups again, failed to disappoint. This is a thoroughly enjoyable film. A near perfect film, it's fiftie's period captured beautifully. As a movie lover, it's a film, I urge you to see, if you haven't. Another scene of mention was in the candy store, Wheaton and the older owner, sharing conversation regarding the older and more favorable brother, (John Cusack) who had recently died, Wheaton, the excluded, the centre of blame by his father. It's almost impossible to fault this film of top notch and believable acting, Sutherland, making great on his role as a truly scary thug, threatening with a knife, where the younger group won't back down.",

Of course, I was born in 1979 and I remember going to see this at the movie theatres when I was 7 with my dad which my mom wouldn't let me see a R film at all, but I still remember seeing it. I enjoyed watching this movie through the years. It's excellent for teenagers and adults like me. It's actually funny too, Jerry O' Connell was hysterical as the little and nervous fat kid who tries to be very tough and strong. The only kid that brought the movie down was that Gordie kid. He should've not of been in the movie. He was weird and I didn't like him at all. But still a very good movie and I'm trying to buy it on DVD.",

219,11 December 2014,Rickting,10, The coming of age tale to rule them all,"Stand By Me is an important film for many and it's not at all hard to See why. It's an adaptation of a Stephen King short story, centering on 4 friends who go out on a journey to retrieve a dead body. After watching Stand By Me there's little to no reason to watch any other coming of age film, since this shows all the genre is about in under 90 minutes and leaves you glowing. It manages to get a remarkable amount of material in only 88 minutes. It hasn't really aged at all and there aren't many flaws. SBM proves that child actors don't always deserve the hate, as the cast are very strong throughout- look out for a pre Jack Bauer Keifer Sutherland. All of the characters are well developed and have interesting relationships, and even though you only know them for an hour and half you grow to care about all of them. Rob Reiner directs the film superbly, wringing fine cinematography out of a fairly small drama and creating plenty of exciting and funny moments as well. SBM seems to have it all.",

It's perfect. Watch it while it's still on Netflix. Maybe it's the ""boy-who-grew-up-to-be-a-writer"" in me talking, but there was something so human and true about Stand By Me. This movie is the ultimate example of a work gelling together well to become greater than the sum of its excellent parts-pitch-perfect dialogue, a story intimate and personal enough for its setting and stakes, and resonant themes of coming-of-age are all captured so eloquently in the acting, direction, and nostalgic 1959 production design to make an amazing final product where everything works. I also respect this film so deeply for telling a complete, compelling story where every character leaves an impression in just 88 minutes.",

Plain and simple this is just a flat out fun movie.  Many memorable moments involving leeches, Chopper the dog, the barf-o-rama, and of course the ""traaaaaaaaain!!!""  All four kids are great in their roles, each with a seperate turn to cry at some point in the film.  Although it was odd that the chubby kid (O'Connell), usually the target of criticisms most of the way, only cried because of the near death experience he had, not because of any emotional problem like the others.  And despite what some say, I think the foul language used could be possible by real life boys, with my view being it depended on your upbringing.  I was one of a quartet who happened to not use those words for fear of being told on, but I've certainly come across younger kids who swear pretty bad, so it all depends.

They set out on a crazy adventure to find the body of Ray Brower (Luttrell) , four months ago Gordie's brother Denny (Cusack) died in a terrible car accident and this makes Gordie want to find that kid more than anything. What the boys don't know is that a gang of local bad boys including Ace (Sutherland) are also hot on the trail. Now it's a question to see which group will find Ray Brower first. Stand By Me is one of the most poignant films of the 1980's and still remains a favorite today.

This film really is more about the journey rather than the destination however, and I think what it really nails is what most 12 year old kids get up to when they start exploring, putting themselves in danger, and lying to their parents about where they are.

I loved Corey Feldman's Teddy and even overweight,naive Verne(Jerry O'Connell before his days as a slim cutie Derek from Scream 2).

I had friends like Gordi in the film has. And although we didn't found a dead body, we shared the same kind of adventures and lost each other as we grew up. But it's not just the relatability that makes it a great film. The performance of the young cast (especially River Phoenix) thanks to the superb director Reiner, the script that feels so natural and the beautiful light warm cinematography...it is a gem of a movie that only becomes more important as one grows older in life.",

He's not a violent bully like his father and older brother, in fact he's just the opposite. He's a peacemaker. He's not destructive. He comforts his friends when they cry. He stops one from committing suicide. He's wise. He's articulate. He has good manners. And he's only about 15, perhaps younger. It's all a very nice story.",
264,15 November 2006,faraaj-1,8, Coming of age in 50's America,"Stand By Me is one of the best coming of age movies set in a small American town of the 1950's. The period details are excellent and the story of a band of friends about to enter their teens is very well told. Stand By Me is one of four novellas of Stephen King's Different Seasons. The other two that were filmed were Apt Pupil and The Shawshank Redemption. As I recall, Stand By Me is quite faithful to the original story (The Body) which was very well told. I think the direction and the casting are the real coups that make the film such an endearing classic for many.",

It's an incredible, sentimental tale of four boys, Chris, Gordie, Teddy, and Vern and their quest to find the body of Ray Brower. This movie had me right when I saw the charm of it. During the movie you get to see into the lives of the boys, and you find that this movie is really about friendship, and needing your friends through hard times. Stand By Me also has a few funny wise cracks, and times that will pull at your heartstrings. I think the ability to include so many different aspects in one movie is fantastic, and definitely a worthwhile film. I recommend Stand By Me to anybody and everybody- I can't think of many people who wouldn't enjoy this ""coming of age story"" that will grab you and catch your attention just like it has mine, over and over again, not matter how many times i watch it.",

273,13 August 2022,joncarrollAttorney,7, Great family film,"Director Rob Reiner skillfully crafts a compelling tale from a Stephen King short story, layering it with various sub-texts that run the gamut from dealing with the town bully to confronting the loss of family. What's probably most remarkable about the picture are the performances that Reiner obtains from his young starring cast, most notably River Phoenix as Chris Chambers, and Wil Wheaton as his best friend Gordie Lachance. Told through the perspective of Wheaton's character, the film conjures up memories of the many trials and tribulations one faces while growing up, often unsure of oneself and even worse, feeling alone and disoriented when personal tragedy strikes and threatens to overwhelm one's very being. Yet the story never gets maudlin or depressing, there's enough youthful camaraderie and mischief on hand to keep the adventurous foursome going strong. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell round out the group, and together they manage to grow and mature in a way that none of them could have imagined prior to starting their quest. Scored with a soundtrack that memorializes some of the great song hits from a half century ago, ""Stand By Me"" is a strange and wonderful journey, in it's own way reminding us of what might have been the best time of our lives.",

Then, in the fullness of late summer, he and three of his friends embarked on an adventure that changed the course of their very carefree existence: a journey deep into the nearby woods to find the body of one of their very own missing classmates. Weeks prior, Ray Brower had disappeared and was presumed dead by authorities; now, armed with a veiled suggestion that his remains rest by a lake near where train tracks cross through the woods, the four hike up to the woodland grave-site to discover the body, bring it back to town and be hailed as heroes by the media.",

This is a shining example of a great story with a great script, that doesn't have an ounce of traditional horror in it. King knows how to write real people, very well. This will always be one of my favourites, it is lacking in a few places, but it is so succinct in others that you can't really complain.  It manages to get a harrowing, enjoyable, simple and beautiful story into 90 mins and is riveting to watch.  No other movie has captured the essence of being twelve so well.  Forget the Goonies or Home Alone or any of that other stuff, this is a kids movie and an adults movie at the same time.  It taps into how you miss being twelve, even when your thirteen!  The characters are seen at a time just before they lose all innocence; before women come into there lives and change everything. This is a movie that always brings a smile to your face and can be watched time and time again.",

For instance, what happens with the child's relationship with his father. Or for that matter, nothing of the gang that promises they would never forget and take revenge has been shown. It was a disappointing ending. The acting performances were good, especially Verne. But the films meanders midway with not much happening. It just fails to light up and pick up pace. Some of the scenes though are hilarious, the one in which Verne keeps vigil at night standing out. But it is not a top 250 movie by any stretch of imagination. I would give it a 6 on 10.",

And I have seen almost all Anderson films, (I will see There Will Be Blood tomorrow) And talking about Anderson, I think that is a good example for what I'm trying to say. When I watch Magnolia or Boggie Nights, there are scenes that, I just keep silence, I don't know why. Wheter if I have no words, or I'm shocked, I keep silence for almost the entire film. And then, all the rest of the day, I think about that film, saying nothing, even thinking nothing, just ""feeling"" the movie. Well, that's the exact case with Stand By Me. I first saw it when I was like 8 years old, and I didn't catch it, I didn't like nor hate it, nothing. Just a movie. Yesterday, I bought the DVD, I saw it this morning and now I'm in silence. The story in Stand by Me is actually simple: in a small US town, end of the 50's, a small group of 12-almost 13 year old boys escape on the search of a teenager's dead body, so they can come back home and be awarded as heroes. Easy thing. Sho why is this so special? It's not the story, is the characters. Based on Stephen King's The Body, director Rob Reiner grabbed a cast of kids that, in my opinion, wheren't actors playing those characters but rather those characters in the flesh, with their pros and cons.

Stand By Me is a drama based on a short story by Stephen King. Although there are alot of very humorous scenes(Lard Ass story, the comb, the conversations around the campfire) there is alot of depth and meaning.

Rob Reiner is a master at directing simple but touching little stories. Anyone who has watched The Princess Bride and this movie would agree that the late 80's was Reiner's golden years. Most notable of the names in the cast is that of the late River Phoenix, in one of his first film roles. The story revolves around four 12-year-old boys living in the small town of Castle Rock. They set out to find the corpse of a missing child and in the process build brick by brick a friendship that transcends all kinds of relationships. It makes you look back on the past faces that have come in and out of the pages of your own life. The last line of the film is considerably one of the best lines in the history of cinema.

308,4 July 2005,Jedi2000000000,9, Memories of Stand By Me,"Stand by Me adapted from the 1981 novella, written by Stephen King, The Body, is a allegory for any person that wants to spend the last weekend with their chums and engage on an odyssey that demonstrates honesty and aspiration. The nexus between the four main friends is both kind and noble. The way the film's narrator, who is played by legendary film actor Richard Dryffus (apologize for any misspelled words and erroneous grammar)who plays one of the young boys grown up as a writer, and how he sees in the beginning of the film those two boys on the bike allows him to reflect on his childhood and how friendship is eternal. The last ten minutes of the film, for me, are the most memorable and emotional when Chris Chanmbers, played by the late River Phoenix, is described by Richard Dryfus as being killed to try to settle a dispute, which reflects Mr. Chambers kind and conciliatory character, which was greatly accentuated by Mr. Phoenix understanding and passionate role. Thank you to Rob Reiner, Stephen King and the entire cast and filmmakers working on the film.",

Vern was the fat kid who never quite fitted in but he tried his best, he was constantly picked on by Teddy.

Rob Reiner has taken the short story ""The Body"" by Stephen King and Transformed it into a classic coming of age movie. I was totally blown away after the first time I saw it. You know how a lot of pre-teen movies have always downplayed what its like for kids growing up. They rarely get it right and it usually comes across hokey or insincere. Not here, Stand by me pulled absolutely no punches. The dialog of these kids felt so genuine that it was refreshing. Yes they do curse like sailors at times but that is what makes it so real. The cast is flawless. Will Weaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connel are perfectly cast in each of their respected roles. My favorite scene is when they cross a stream thinking its shallow but it is really deep. They all fall in and ""Vern"" says that he told them should have gone the other way. In a complete deadpan ""Teddy"" asks Vern. ""Is it me? Or are you the worlds biggest P----?"" LOL! If you have never seen this movie, SEE IT. You wont be disappointed!",
315,11 June 2008,YankeeDood,9, True To Life,"Yes, this movie is definitely sad and you just don't feel the same after watching it. It holds a special place in my heart, especially the unfortunate fact that not only did actor River Phoenix die in the movie, but in real life too! If you've never seen Stand By Me, I highly recommend seeing it uncut instead of watching it on a channel like AMC. Not because of the profanity itself, rather because you need to experience what these boys truly said to each other and how it relates to their emotions so you can fully grasp what the movie's message is all about - how short life really is. I think the saddest line in this movie is when the Writer (Dreyfus) talks about how friends come in and out of your life like ""bus-boys in a restaurant"". Man, that is very true and very sad to think about. I've been trying to find a best friend I knew when I was 12 and to this day, I cannot locate him. For all I know, he could be deceased. I also used to walk with childhood friends along a railroad track near my grandmother's house in the summertime, so that part brings back fond memories too. The Stephen King novella Stand By Me is based on is also very emotional and I recommend reading it first to get a taste of what Reiner's film will be. It's unforgettable and timeless.

317,27 March 2016,lefkiosvanrooy,9, An incredibly important and profound story - this movie is a life-altering experience,"There is no questioning the significance of this film, describing a period in time and the way society was during that time, but what has amazed me, the second time viewing it, is the purity that characterizes this movie, and in particular its 4 main characters. This movie is so smart in describing the complexities of the minds of four young teens, how their nature and nurture has shaped them into the personalities they now carry, and how these traits and characteristics are influenced and changed themselves throughout moments in life, and by interacting with others. There is almost a post-war melancholy lingering over the air in this town of Oregon, Portland where these four kids happen to live in 1956. This group of friends bond over the support and comfort they find in each other, being 4 kids trying to survive in a period of their lives where everything is so intense and confusing, and where they've found themselves pretty much on their own, without the support of their families. The bravery of these four kids (and yes, even Vern's) inspires me, their willingness to plough on and to continually try to make sense of what this world has given them. The screenwriter and director have created incredibly profound and deep characters in these kids, while still not taking away their innocence and youth. When I watch the games they play, the manners they use, I'm reminded of the things I held important in that truly magical time of my life, like the sacred importance of a pinky swear, or the two punches for flinching annoyance. To me this is a story that pretty much any person can relate to, as it symbolizes a period in the life of someone where they felt lost, terrified, completely isolated, but not defeated. The need that Gordie feels to find the dead body is essentially a need to make sense of it all, of the things that happened in his life; why his brother had to die, why his dad never seemed to show any interest in him, why he felt he would never be able to amount to anything. These four kids are oppressed in a society that treats them with indifference and where they're victims of incessant bullying, and through this journey, they are able to fight through those feelings by exposing themselves to situations that push them to the brink and essentially, make them face those emotions of injustice head on. When I compare the world that these kids live in to the one my generation lives now, one thing remains the same: it is exhausting a job to try to make sense of everything that is happening around you. And in a world where nothing seems to be right and within your control, these kids find a mission that makes sense to them, one simple adventure that no one can take away from them, something that is within their control. And through this simple plan that only they have thought of, through this journey outside the confinements of this empty town they were brought up in, they could find the strength to face their deepest fears and to be the most vulnerable, in the company of true friends, where no real judgement and mockery can be found. Not all of these 4 heroes ended up truly succeeding in life, and that's okay because the truth is few of us will ever reach a true sense of achieving in life. But just like the narrator of this story, as long as we are able to remember that period in our lives that was the toughest, yet the most magical and intense period of our youth, as long as we find people to share a trip to the woods like these teens did, then we will capture a moment, a moment in our lives that was shared and experienced with certain souls that will never truly go away. And maybe a life filled with moments like these will truly suffice.",

I saw it again, and i had missed so much the first time. i long for the days of being 12 again. Doesn't everyone? The movie stand by me is about 4 boys, who were like the cool kids, who take their biggest adventure. THe film is all about the friendship that is shared along the way. Unrtil the very end. There are many hardships that they face through the course of the movie, and how they deal with them. The movie is based on the short story the body, by Stephen king.

The kids of this movie are amazing they give such a amazing performance for both the kids and the teenagers and they are so real and give a wonderful view into the life of 12 year old boys. stand by me has a story of a group of boys who are looking for a young boys body and they go on a epic quest of adventure and we follow there journey from their small town to locate the body. i have to say that this movie is so iconic that it doesn't need introducing and the story is so iconic and the original is based on a story by Steven King and honestly I haven't read the book but i would think that it would stay close to the source material and for me this is such a good movie and i would watch it again and would suggest it to any one who likes a adventure movie.",

This movies captures childhood, and those last moments before people expect you to act mature. The one last adventure, and on that adventure, they discovered more about each other and themselves than they could have in a lifetime. With a movie like this, It could've been terrible or awesome, and it wasn't terrible. It light hearted, funny and serious all at the same time, which normally spells out disaster. But it's a story thats so easy to relate to. It's a universal thing, but it's still its own. I cried during this movie, and this movie will stand the test of time, just like it has all this time.",

Stephen King movies on both the silver screen and the small screen tend to be very poor and tedious, with an ending coming out of left field. ""The Langoliers"" was enough to make me swear off any King on TV thenceforth. ""Stand By Me"" was something else altogether. Much more character driven than other King adaptations, with more sincerity and no gore in sight. Excellent casting, a strong if treacly script and settings in the lush forests of Oregon make up for the slightly slow pacing.",

328,8 January 2021,ryanjosephford,10, Beautiful Story,"This movie is very faithful to the short story, which is beautiful. Stephen King from IT, to the Green Mile, to The Body, has always been able to produce an incredible work of art. From the books to the movies I always find myself at a loss of words. The movie is 10/10 for me. From the heartfelt realization of adulthood that this movie portrays (from the mind of a 12 year old in the story, obviously written by an adult), you understand themes and elements that portray to your daily life.
My favorite instance of writing in the short story being Chris (at 12 years old) understanding the interweaving elements of being an adult with adult ideas stemming from childhood struggles, realized at the precise point In time that it happens (when he's 12). Chris understands his current status in life, and makes sure that main protagonist Gordie understands that life is really real through the eyes of an adult.
I'm on the verge of turning 25, and the elements brought forth in this movie/in the short story for which it's based off of (The Body by Stephen King), are profoundly poetic and beautiful.
Within each scene you understand the struggles that each character is going through, only made true through your own thoughts creates through the movie/short story. Every point made and thematic element is understandable and heartfelt.
This story is truly incredible and worthy of a 10/10 rating. Very moving. Thank you again Stephen King",

We have since lost touch with each other but i still think back often of the many good times we had together and all of the memories we made. back when you spent all summer long hanging out and having sleeping overs at your friends, before you had to worry about getting a summer job and everything else that comes with growing up.

347,20 June 2014,ngclover02,10," ""You never have friends as good as the ones you had when you were twelve""","Stand By Me is the story of one-of-a-kind friendships. The movie starts out with a man writing a book recalling that ""you never have friends as good as the ones you had when you were twelve"". The author is who the movie revolves around, Gordie Lachance. Gordie (Wil Wheaton), Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman), and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) are four friends who embark on a journey of their life at the age of twelve. They set out to find the body of a dead kid, whom Vern overhears his brother stating the boy's location, but the foursome end up facing many obstacles along the way including a bully, Ace, played by Keifer Sutherland. While the boys are going to a grim destination, the bond and adventure that they endure is one that will last them a lifetime. A theme of this film would be to enjoy your childhood because growing up sucks and happens way faster than you realize. Gordie realizes this after the death of his older brother at which point he becomes invisible to his parents. All four of the boys came back from their journey with a new sense of maturity. I think seeing the dead boy along with the run-in with Ace's gang contributed to that along with other iconic scenes such as sleeping in the woods, Chopper, and swimming with the leeches. Another good movie that has the same theme as Stand By Me would be The Goonies. Both movies have a group of kids set out on an adventure that end up growing a little on the way. The scene in which Gordie and Chris are talking about Gordie taking advanced classes when they go back to school uses lighting to contribute to the theme. The lighting is soft on Gordie which makes him seem very childlike and hard on Chris with makes him seem more mature. This was kind of ironic as Chris was the one that was supposed to be the trouble maker and who I think would be considered childish whereas Gordie is more mature most of the movie. For example, Gordie doesn't horse around as much as the other three boys. I think the radio music also contributed to the theme since it was happy 50's music used as a motif to portray happiness, which goes along with most childhood memories especially those with your friends. In conclusion, enjoy your childhood while you still have it. As this movie teaches the viewer, it goes by way too fast. We always seem to take time for granted and issues that occurred while we were young seemed such a big deal then but now we know that they were trivial compared to issues that we have to face as adults.",
348,2 June 2018,adam-may-bower,10, This Made Me Cry,"'Stand By Me' is a moving coming-of-age film, with brilliant directing by Rob Reiner and commendable acting from its young cast. This film may have it's few little flaws, but they are ultimately overlooked by the amount of heart in this movie. This film had me emotionally invested from the first scene and has resonated deeply within me. I have never watched a movie before that made me ponder so much about my own life and feel intense feelings of nostalgia. The simple, yet captivating story allows this film to focus on it's complex and relatable characters, which are all played superbly by the child actors. The two supporting characters out of the foursome, played by Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell, are not exactly likeable in the way you'd expect them to be, it's really the two main characters, played brilliantly by Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix, that are the highlight of the film and beautifully represent childhood friendships. When combined with Reiner's smart directing, striking cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth and the great selection of 50's music, you get a near-perfect and beautiful film about childhood, innocence, and death.",

That is what this movie becomes...a true experience. Yes I saw it again and I too remembered that not too long ago, I too was like them, a boy with friends who would go to the end of the world, a boy in search of himself. River Phoenix delivers a performance that we have not seen from an actor his age. Truly splendid, leaving one to wonder what he might have achieved only he was still alive. A very poignant ending, where the actor looks back at his life down nostalgia lane and delivers a worldly truth...yes the best friends are those that we had when we were still young, free and looking forward to all the challenges the world may hold...for we were invincible then!!",

Wil Wheaton, River of course, Jerry, Corey Feldman even Kiefer (24) Sutherland plays a very nasty bully/rebel. I laughed and laughed when they played drive-by baseball. Rob (Spinal Tap) Reiner directs this perfectly too. Basically we follow 4 young lads on the search for a dead boy.

This is a rare and emotional film about the experiences of growing up and what kids face. Stand by me has to be the best coming of age film every maybe even the best all round film.

The actors help him with the outstanding performance by River Phoenix, who shows us that young actors aren't only Macaaulay Cukin' style. ""Stand By Me"" is like a man who walks on tiptoe: feelings are suggested but not shouted and also an action scene like the one of the rail bridge is made without a videoclip rhythm.

It is an deep and does an an amazing job of reanacting the novella. The plot is amazing. It's the summer that every kid has to have. The one where the only thing that matters is being with your friends and having fun. Before everything else sets in. It tells of four best friends with all messed up family life's which mostly all they have is each other. Most definitely one of my favorite movies ever. It follows the boys as they journey to find something that will either make them or break them. What they are searching for is something that will make them local hero's. I thought that book was greatly amazing as the book. Stephen King did an excellent job on his part. But he never ceases to fail in my book. The cast was well chosen out for each part. Especially River for Chirs, and Corey Feldman for Teddy. They both did an amazing job adapting to there characters. This goes above and beyond of movies that friendship movies that go deep.

But, because of this movie, every time I hear the song, ""Stand By Me"" I just have to listen to it. This has to be one of my favorite movies and will always be one of my favorites movies. Maybe because I, myself, had three really close friends when I was that age. It's now about seven years later, and none of us hang out anymore. I didn't think much of it at first, but after seeing this movie, I realized how much I liked them and how much fun we had. Also, after seeing this movie, I realized how sad it actually made me to know that I may never see them again because we're all going to different colleges. That's how powerful this movie is. And in the end, he realizes they were the best friends he's ever had. The acting and story is absolutely amazing. They really show how good of friends these kids are and how time and different situations in their lives can just tear them apart. I have never cried at a movie, and this is no exception.

I think the main quartet of characters are very wonderful and well-acted, and they fit very well together. The setting is nostalgic, and I feel like this film just has a lot of themes that can connect to adolescence and growing up, as well as life. The way things in life can affect you, but also are such small things. A nice 1980's movie with good writing.

The scene in the Junkyard when they think that the owner is saying ""sick balls"" to Chopper the dog is very funny.",

368,13 June 2019,robbinsbenjamin-98588,10, It ages like a fine wine.,"I'm going to keep this short. To the younger audience that haven't seen this movie, you need to. I'm now 34 and a father of three young children. When I was 13 I had three best friends, and we used to watch this movie almost every month , we practically knew the script. But as I age I find myself connecting more with the narration and remembering what it was like to be that age, how wonderful and vibrant life was, how a whole day used to feel like a whole day and not a few hours, Couple this brilliant capture of nostalgia, with wonderful acting from 4 young talented actors, you have a classic, as the closing scenes say, I've never had best friends like I did when I was 12.... Jesus, does anybody?",
369,7 April 2019,fieldimdb,10, Why Stand By Me?,The thing about Stand By Me is no matter how many times you watch it you still appreciate that you are watching one of the true greats. We are catapulted back to the summer of 1959 where four twelve year old boys take a trek through the Oregon back country in search of the dead body of a missing boy. The four leads have never been better and there is great support from Kiefer Sutherland. The scene where William Bronder quietens and turns the tables on the four rebellious youths by telling Corey Feldman what he thinks of his father is a scream and the best scene in the film. A modern classic.,
370,25 September 2020,devynfriend,10, When Does Friendship Peak?,"A heart-warming movie, ""Stand by Me"" takes place in the 50s and brings 4 best friends through an adventurous hike on the train tracks to find a dead body. Rob Reiner's 1986 film is a story of friendship and growing up. These boys have had some of the toughest lives but their stories are one reason this movie is so entertaining. You'd be surprised to learn what they deal with at such a young age. This film does a wonderful job of portraying young friendships during the 50s.
Centered around the difficulties children and families have gone through in the 50s, it realistically brings depth and meaning to what you have imagined during those times. Each of the boys have experienced tremendous pain in their lives. Either from family physical abuse, substance abuse, neglect, and/or death. All have suffered from poverty in these hard times. For example, Teddy grew up with a crazy father--that suffers from war PTSD--that also almost burnt off Teddy's ear. Another example is Chris, who grew up with a bad family and had a reputation that he would turn out bad too. These boys show most of the struggles civilians dealt with back in the 50s.
This friendship is as real as can be and they would do anything for each other. They make fun of each other, as most boys do, they do rebellious stunts that can get them in big trouble, make pinkie swears, but they also care for each other in a way that you don't see in most young friendships. When they get bullied by the older kids, they stick up for each other. They have deep conversations about what they are going through with each other. For example, Teddy tries to do something crazy by standing in front of the train tracks when a train was coming, but Chris pulled him off and yelled at him to knock some sense into him. Another example is when Gordie stays back with Vern when he has to crawl instead of walk on the train tracks on a high bridge since he is afraid of heights. They all love, support, and take care of each other.
In my opinion, they are only 12 and too young for some of the activities that they do. This is mainly because of the environment they are around that force them to be more mature. In the movie, they are out and about without their parents knowing or caring about where they are. They also smoke cigarettes throughout the movie like it is normal. Chris also had a gun which he shouldn't have had excess too. Them acting this way shows the difference between life back then and how life is now.
The directors chose amazing characters that fit the plot perfectly. The main character, Gordie, narrates the movie from himself as an adult, telling the story of him and his friends at a young age. The character is smarter than the other boys and has better chances of a great future. The only thing is, his brother had just passed away and his mother and father ignore him now, since his brother was the favorite. Chris, who is Gordie's best friend, is the leader of the group and has a very compassionate side. He is empathic towards Gordie and is always hard on himself. Teddy has an emotional side when it comes to his father. Vern is clueless character that is brings humor to the movie. They all make fun of him but not to be mean; it's just them being friends. Each of the characters make you feel empathic towards them. They are what makes the movie so great.
""Stand by me"" brings funny and traumatic events wrapped up into a powerful movie. It truly shows the strength of how young friendships impact a person with the last line of the movie said by Gordie as an adult, ""I never really had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. ... Does anyone?"" This line woke me up to the fact of how sad growing up really is. A bond of friendship is never the same as when we are young. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and the yearn for adventure and friendship.",

Throughout the film, they undergo many challenges and come to conclusions about their hometown, the world and themselves. All the boys are very different; there is at least one trait within each of the boys that everyone can relate to. This movie has a perfect combination of seriousness and the more immature and fun ways of youth. The characters deal with normal problems at the age of twelve as well as other problems like dealing with death, bad reputations and local myths. Some of the things they learn are discovered in a comical way and they learn the difference between myth and reality. The script is based on the novel ""The Body"" by Stephen King. Reiner closely follows the book but adds things here and there that make it much more exciting and relatable. The script is clever and well written. This movie is funny, emotional, suspenseful and a must see.",
374,22 October 2000,doug_funnie,10, Amazing and wonderful!,"I LOVE this movie, it's so great! It's a really nice, fun and touching story that makes for an enjoyable film. When I started to watch it, I was totally hooked. The story of 4 best friends and their adventures is acted and directed so well, you almost wish you yourself had those adventures. The 4 young actors are perfectly casted and their acting is incredible for a young child actor. The movie and the actors really deserved more awards than the movie actually got. The script is the only thing that is OK. It has it's memorable quotes but there really is A LOT of swearing for a young 12 year old. The adventures (and talks) the boys have, make the movie so enjoyable, you won't care seeing it again (I wouldn't). I really loved this movie and I'd recommend it to every one of my friends!",
375,21 October 2012,filmchaser,8, The Social Experiment of Stand By Me,"In the film Stand by Me, there are two groups of boys-to-men who are tribal in their relationships. One lead by ""Ace"" exist to destroy, bully, and inflict pain. The other led by ""Chris"" exist to find adventure, experience life without authority, and create opportunities to be heroes, even if misguided. Traditionally, as in West Side Story, the two gangs would meet and fight it out, over a woman or an insult. In this film, the two gangs compete for notoriety about discovering a dead kid's body, which is a sign of the times and the culture they live in. Life moved pretty slowly back then, and kids had to use their imaginations. I enjoyed how the film moved very calmly from one event to the next, using kick ass writing and acting instead of special effects to make the film interesting. Usually that combination is only found in independent films, so it's a credit to Rob Reiner and the perfect casting of the young, extremely talented actors, as well as the talented screen writing that this film will remain a classic for all time. River Phoenix stole the film, and established himself as one of the most gifted actors of all time. I thought Will Wheaton was a little stiff, but his fragile doe-eyed looks provided attributes to his character that his acting lacked. Corey Feldman was perfect as the child of a crazed post-traumatic war veteran...all fierce with innocently displaced loyalty to his abusive father. ""Vern"" was perfect as the nervously chattering fat kid who only wanted to be accepted as part of the group, less complex emotionally, and mostly interested in food. Keifer Sutherland was a little too convincing as the sadistic bully with his eternal sneer and dead eyes. His supportive crew were convincing as ""tough guy"" followers and wannabe gang members for that period of time. It would have been satisfying to hear what became of ""Ace"" and his gang in the final narration. I think Richard Dreyfuss was grossly miscast as the adult version of Will Wheaton's character, first of all because there is NO RESEMBLANCE whatsoever. Overall, the film is ageless as evidenced by the fact that my 18 year old son watched it recently and loved it as one of his favorite movies. It must speak to those feelings and emotions young males are reluctant to express openly; and the loyalties that develop between young boys who don't have great relationships with their fathers. Somehow the film is comforting in that way, and for that, it has accomplished the greatness of art imitating life.",

378,8 February 2011,pulpfiction1-971-870670,9, Epic beyond belief for what it is.,"""Stand By Me"" truly is epic beyond belief for what it is. This is due to various reasons. 1). Its cast is mainly children. Quite often films with casts children dominated lack quality acting as the youngsters simply have just not been in the business long enough to be able to deliver impressive performances. However ""Stand By Me""'s young cast all are believable and show great chemistry. River Phoenix in particular is amazing as the brave , yet troubled ""Chris"". 2). The film is very very short. Quite often the best films are around 2 hours in length. Often this duration is necessary for a film to drum up enough depth for it to stay with the viewer long after the credits. ""Stand By Me"" has no trouble going into decent amounts of depth and staying with the viewer in only 85 minutes. Its nice to watch a film which doesn't drag on. There is too many of that these days. 3).The focus of this film is on children so you would think it would probably only appeal to a childish audience.Yet it doesn't. It deals with some heavier material than initially expected but this is welcomed by more mature viewers. Plus most of us value our childhoods so its childhood friendship content is refreshing to view as it encourages us to reminisce on our good times of our younger days. In saying that it is epic for what it is I guess it was always going to be in some ways as its written by arguably the most successful writer of the 20th century Stephen King. Richard Dreyfus (Jaws) plays a satisfying side role as the older ""Gordie"" who narrates the story. ",
379,9 April 2001,marcfantozzi,10, God bless you River Phoenix!,"Okay, okay, I know that this is the second review of Stand by Me I have submitted, but as time has passed since I wrote the last review, this has become one of my top 5 favorite films. It gets better the more times you watch it. River Phoenix is a magnificent actor. He is definitely one of my favorites. I wish I had the skill to act such as he. It is so sad what happened to him though. I love Stand by Me. After you view this great flick, you think differently about friendship, I wish I had the adventures that the four boys had. Stand by Me is an adventure fantasy, but almost everyone can relate to it and understand what the characters were going through. The character development is brilliant, the watcher gets to know and feel for all of the characters in the film. Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack and Richard Dreyfuss are all stunning. Wow, what a great cast. I thought Now and Then was a good film, but when compared to Stand by Me, it has a long way to go. I am outraged that people consider Now and Then the Stand by Me for girls. I love this film, and am so glad I found a copy on DVD. God bless River Phoenix. A great actor that everyone should look up to and respect!",
380,9 September 2010,hvh80,9, I can see this movie OVER AND OVER AGAIN!,Stand By Me was THE MOVIE through which I became interested in the brilliant actor River Phoenix of which I'm a huge fan for such a long time now. Not only River but also the other young actor's put up a terrific acting performance in this beautiful movie about friendship. Especially the scene where we can see the opposite between the childish Vern and Teddy talking about Mighty Mouse and the mature conversation between Chris and Gordy about their next school. And of course the (very well played by River) crying scene from Chris about the milkmoney is absolutely one to remember. ,

The boys figure if they find the body it might bring them fame and fortune and may help them to escape their dreary lives in Castle Rock.Along the way the boys discover things about themselves and realise they aren't as strong as they thought, and maybe finding a kids dead body isn't exactly going to be the trip of a life time that they had had in mind.

In the end, though, the movie is a missed opportunity that turns into a by-the-numbers coming-of-age flick. While the protagonists sure are fun characters, the gang of antagonists and parents/adults seem a bit wasted and one-dimensional. I get the feeling Stand by Me starts from a kid's point of view, and therefore it makes sense that the people in our young heroes' lives seem a bit black-and-white, but the kids' development follows non sequiturs and therefore seems a bit uneven.",

All the young actors perform quite well, especially River Phoenix. (This was the actor's best performance.) The narration works quite well, and the film succedes at being dramatic, funny and haunting (see Gordie's dream)  at the same time, without diversion from the story. Finally, as in all King's films, there is an excellent villain. In ""Stand By Me"" he is Ace Merril. As played by Kiefer Sutherland, Merril's intimidation practically leaps of the screen and punches you in the face, especially at the end.",

In this movie the kids seem to genuinely feel like good friends that are acting as themselves and really feeling their emotions. I give a great deal of credit to Rob Reiner for that because he really had to help them learn how to act at that age.I was most impressed, however, with River Phoenix who was a fantastic actor, even as a kid. All of the kids are so true to their characters and do an excellent job. I love coming-of-age stories, and this is the best I've ever seen.

Stephen King's writings do not always translate well to film, one only has to look at some of the horror novels which have become films for proof of this.

Based on The Body by: Stephen King directed by: Rob Riener,Stand By Me is a story of four best friends in the 1980s went on an adventurous trip to find a dead body. It turns out that they begin to come closer and learn more about each other. They are finding out who they are and who they will become.,
412,8 January 2022,lacatro,10, Pure and truea,I love this movie! I was 16 when it came out and had already devoted every Stephen King book I could get my hands on. I love this movie because it stayed true to the novella. And the actors were so pure and true.,
413,2 November 2014,Kimkachyrak,8, Great Soundtrack,"Stand by Me is a coming of age film starring Will Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell. The Movie is based upon the novel by Stephen King, ""The Body."" Four childhood friends embark on an adventure to find the body of a missing boy. The four friends are different from each other and each have their demons that they are battling. Throughout the film, their issues are unfolded which lead to the choices they make. Will Wheaton plays the lead, Gordie Lachance, a quiet, reserved character who is living in his late brother's shadow and with a resentful father, he bears guilt. River Phoenix plays Chris Chambers, who came from a bad family and is known as a thief. Corey Feldman plays Teddy Duchamp, a known physically abused kid. Jerry O'Connell plays Vern Tessio, the pathetic, easily teased, ""fat kid"". The editing effectively guides the audiences' thoughts, associations, and emotional responses right from the beginning sequence. In the beginning, we see the storyteller, played by Richard Dreyfuss, sitting in his pickup, looking into the distance as two young teens pedal by on their bicycles. He looks at a news article telling of a person's death. The camera zooms in slow motion focusing in on the expression of Dreyfuss' character who looks deep in thought. The zoom transitions into a start of a flashback as the narrator begins to voice-over the story. This one scene involves a massive amount of editing in such a small amount of time. The music in the background also sets an emotional tone. The kids on bicycles riding by, perhaps foreshadows that the story is about kids that age. And who is the person in the article of the paper? Will we find out? This scene is a great example of smooth continuity and coherence.",
414,21 July 2020,bertrambuchert,8, Beautiful movie,"Being 16 and watching this movie there's nothing more I would like currently than walking down some train tracks with my friends in the summer light. This movie is every Childs/teens dream feeling free and away from their parents. Thats what I think this movie showcases and succeeds in. Its a beautiful story which shows us the ""utopian life"" of life as a 12 year old in the 1980s and makes me in 2020 want to be there.",
415,1 October 2020,ejmc111,9, The Body read it... then see it!,"Wow! this movie sure woke up some memories, My friends and I walked the tracks from Coventry, RI to Sterling, Ct for many years. The tracks are gone, as well as the train, but the trail and the memories remain. I had some great friends in those days, but life gets in the way, and we don't get together anymore. This is adolescence in the days before video games and internet. Boy do I miss them...",
416,28 November 2015,mufcyas,10," An amazing, realistic and nostalgic experience.","I haven't read Stephen King's novel and I wasn't really sure if I was going to like this movie or not. My expectations were high, though. And it turned out to be one of my favorite movies of all time! The first thing that shocks you and leaves you speechless is the maturity of the main actors. Their acting seems to be so real, so down-to-earth and yet fascinating. I am not much of an emotional person and I do not often cry over movies, because there is always an inner voice telling me: This is not real, this is art, it is supposed to be entertainment. But this... It just hit me as hard as it could, I found myself with tears filling my eyes even the day after watching it. I am only 17, and I know that life is ahead of me, but for some reason it just made me feel nostalgic and old. It made me somehow regret watching it, but at the same time I want to watch it over and over again. I am not a movie expert, but for me - this was not a movie. This was my childhood, my memories, my desperate wish to turn back time. And maybe some more competent people criticize particular parts of this movie (for example, the main actors smiled in some scenes even though they were supposed to be serious), but for me these ""flaws"" made this movie perfect and real. They reminded me of me and my squad when we were that age, our pointless conversations, fights, joking, crying... For me, this movie is by far the best picture of that innocent stage in our lives. And a raw reminder that you'll never be that young and free again. But there are memories that help us. Memories - and things like this movie.",
417,13 March 1999,bretticus25,10, A Great Coming-of-Age Movie,"This movie was very good.  It represented, in an eerie way, the way life was for all of us.  It painted a picture of the real world in such a neat way. Using childhood was quite an effective way to portray that hope can always be found despite the circumstances.  It allowed the viewer to see that no matter where one is in life, we are all in the same boat together, and sometimes during the hard times in life, that is when the best of friends can be found.  I recommend this movie.  It is very memorable.",
418,14 October 2018,jnicol-69288,10, This film is a masterpiece!,"The writing, the variety of characters, the issues they handle and the range of kinds of comedy is all on point. You are missing out if you haven't seen this.",
419,20 April 2010,doctorjagger,10, Timeless Classic,"One of the best (if not the best) coming of age movies of all time. This movie has it all. It has murder mystery. It has misunderstood young men. It has hoodlums. It has flashbacks. And it has cussing cause it's cool. Although none of these actors, with the exception of Kiefer Sutherland, went on to make very major careers, maybe in River Phoenix's case because of his suicide, they all gave very convincing performances. The story was phenomenally captivating.From the start you won't want to stop, it is so much fun. It is a very serious movie, but at the same time it has a lot of well placed humor. All the characters have very distinctive and very likable personalities. The only thing I didn't like was the end where they told us what became of the boys as adults, and said the ""bad boy"" was going to turn his life around but was stabbed. Stephen King seems to like to kill kids (another example of this is ""The Mist"" where the father is forced to shoot his own son). This movie is a timeless classic. I will cherish it forever, and will definitely show this to my children. 50/10!",
420,21 September 2016,galileosmth,6, It Just Did Not Work For Me,"I thought Stand By Me was a good movie. It was decent enough. It just did not exactly click with me. I think it is because I could not identify with any of the characters even though I was once a 12 year- old kid myself, complete with 12 year-old pals, and assorted neighborhood bullies causing me trouble. Maybe it's too difficult, or even impossible to delve into the psyche of ordinary kids and make it somewhat realistic and also entertaining without it being a straight comedy a-la A Christmas Story. But as I said; it wasn't a bad movie. It is not unlike October Sky in some ways, another decent but not unbelievable film.",
421,15 July 2019,annagwilkins,10, Forever my favorite.,"I first watched this film when I was fourteen and have loved it ever since. Something about the pure, raw emotion coming from these young children just radiated into my soul. Stand By Me is a timeless story that can and should be watched by all. From such a wonderful story to a beautiful film adaptation, I would have to say that this is a true work of art. All the actors deliver such genuine character, making the viewer truly relate with everything said. This will always be a movie that I find myself going back to watch, and I hope that those who worked on it can see the vast measure of their efforts.",

Even though they're barely teenagers, the film's four leading actors deliver better performances than most people two or three times their age. The script is terrific; it is nothing short of beautiful to see the bond that Gordie, Chris, Teddy, and Vern have and how they support each other. Rob Reiner's direction really pulls everything together so the movie really works well as a whole. The movie is at times hilariously funny, sentimental (but not mushy), suspenseful, and always moving.",

It has so much meaning and in my opinion was the greatest story Stephan King ever wrote. The entire cast did an outstanding job and at such young ages. Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix gave the performances of a life time... may his soul rest in peace... This story of the friendship of four 12 year old boys is something every one can relate to.",

He is so believable, you should just watch the movie to see him. Will Wheaton also gives an outstanding performance. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell shine in supporting roles. This was just a jumping off point for these guys but, it also had some big names. John Cusack is given about 5 minutes of screen time in flash backs as Gordie(Will Wheaton)and Keifer Surtherland plays the bad to the bone leader of the cobras. Awesome Movie and Awesome Cast.",

This has to be my favourite film. The boys were terrifically cast, especially River Phoenix as Chris Chambers, and you would have never guessed that chubby little Vern was infact Jerry O'Connel. The story line is hilarious and the adventure that the boys have, even though it only lasted a few days, they came back as different people. If you haven't seen this movie, I absolutely highly recommend it, it'll soon become one of your favourites. 11 out of 10!",

I've never seen one like this. I thought that river pheonix's acting was amazing and wil wheaton's character was well acted also. this is one of my favorite movies of all time and it deserves to be in the top 100. i know its in my top 10. i would recommend this movie to anybody. any age any sex an race. this is a MUST SEE.",

The film is magnificent and really captures the true aspect of growing up. The plot is very basic, 4 boys, best friends, go on a journey to find the body of a kid their age; along the way we see them deal with their hardships of growing up and the problems they've encountered throughout their lives. Although there's not too much of a story, the acting from the four friends is absolutely spot on, especially River Phoenix's performance.",

This movie is like a fine bottle of red wine, which only gets better with time. The acting of Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell were truly their break through roles. While River Phoenix only added to the makings of this now classic movie. This movie truly highlights the aspects of being a kid without all the sugar-coating of Hollywood. Real people, foul language(The first movie to receive R rating strictly on the basis of foul language.) and a typical summer vacation. This movie is so wonderfully none that remaking it would only be like trying to make a better mouse trap. This movie is great for both girls and guys, young and old. This movie will make you laugh, cry and will leave you wanting to go out and call your best friend from childhood.",
435,30 December 2013,nicki_in_belgrade,8, Cant believe it has taken me until age of 33 to watch this amazing film!,This was such a wonderful film. The thing that impressed on me most of all was River Phoenix. I hadn't realised who it was until the end of the film. I can't believe how engaging and touching he is in this film. I found myself thinking about the friendships I have had in my life and wishing that any of them had been on a par with these guys. I love how the experiences they go through ( especially with the train and standing up to murder Sutherland) bring them together as friends and completely change them.,

It partly comes from the fact that i am 13 years old, and so i can really relate to what the characters are going through in this movie. There is nothing more sacred than the friendship of children. I can relate to this movie because of how Stephen King, and Rob Reiner had there characters act. Most movies with children portray them is goodie two shoes, who do whatever they are told. This movie has the four 12 year old boys, cussing, smoking, playing poker, and breaking all the rules.",

Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell work so well together, it's like they've always been friends. And together, with Keifer Sutherland, it makes a fantastic group. Not to mention director Rob Reiner, he knows how to direct, because he has been directed. ""all In The Family"" wouldn't be the same if it wasn't for Michael ""Meathead"" Stivick (SP).

The story is simple and yet excellent, you can really relate to it. Acting is incredible, i can't believe these kids could act so good. Some shots were beautifully filmed, when you can see the woods or the hills or the fields... The unspoiled Mother Earth. I guess this movie is so special because it depicts what friendship really means. What it really represents. It's not the kind of depiction one would expect - i mean, searching for a dead body, wow.

I have to say the two people that really stole the show for me was River Phoenix and Kiefer Sutherland. They play their characters so well, and you really sometimes can relate to what they are saying. The chemistry between the two characters is PHENOMENAL. I wouldn't have any body else to play those two characters than the boys who preformed it. They were so young and it was still early in both of their careers.

464,3 January 2007,lvgoold,9, Could watch it over and over again!,"""Stand By Me"" is a simple film that is easy to follow. It contains laughs and suspense and also emotions, which are believable. ""Stand By Me"" is about four 12 year old boys, Gordie (Wil Wheaton), Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman) and Vern (Jerry O'Connell), and how they go on an adventure to find a boy. He has been missing for 3 days. At the beginning of the film you find out that an attorney has been killed but only at the end of the film do you realise the significance of the article. Chris Chambers was the attorney and in my opinion the fact that River Phoenix died at 23 adds more emotion to the end of the film. This film is the best film I have seen recently and the soundtrack, including ""Stand By Me"" by Ben E King, also adds to the 9/10 mark that I have submitted.",

I thought the story line was good; maybe because I could identify the four boys with my own childhood at that age before girls came into the picture. The acting was good although at times I missed the dialog & had to reverse the tape to ""catch"" what the boys said. My only criticism was that expressions were used that were more contemporary than the 50's, and I find it hard to believe that twelve year old living in the early 50's used so many four lettered words.",

As I didn't know any of the cast because the movie was out before my time I looked them up, River Phoenix being of particular interest. As soon as I saw that River had actually passed in 1993 my heart sunk a little bit, his acting in Stand By Me is incredible and definitely some of the best acting I've ever seen. I have took it upon myself to watch all of Rivers films, he was a very talented but underrated actor and my heart hurts for such a tragedy to have happened to him. All of the boys provide an outstanding performance, from the heart breaking scenes of Chris Chambers crying his eyes out to the boys insulting each other and uncontrollably laughing. When I found out River actually couldn't stop crying after they shot his crying scene I truly felt for him. The ending when Ben. E Kings, Stand By Me plays I got shivers as the song just sums up the film. This film is a true masterpiece and I hope that its legacy lives on for a very long time as it is truly amazing and will forever be a favourite of mine.",

The direction and the song makes the story submerged in emotions. Lot to learn about friendship and compassion from the film.,

471,19 December 2011,meshia112233,10, An all-time classic!,"The film ""Stand By Me"" is hands down one of my favorite movies of not only my childhood, but even still today. When I look back on my own youth around the years of 12-14, I can remember so clearly the moments portrayed in the film. Whether it be talking smack about our parents, running around all night saying we were each staying at different houses, or walking along the train tracks during the scorching summer days chucking rocks at the freights that passed by. I recall being skeptical at first about watching this so called ""classic,"" simply because of the fact that i was an adolescent girl and not some ""young dirty boy"" taking hikes to see dead bodies and smoking cigarettes along the way. But from the minute the movie started with all the boys' playing cards in the famous tree house to the moment where Chris Chambers fades away at his and Gordie's final goodbye, I could not help but get a thousand of overwhelming emotions passing through me. I laughed, I cried, I felt angry, and at times even surprised by some of the language that these thirteen year old boys were using. But that is the magic of it all. How often does a movie about pre-teen kids come along where there is no sugar coating, just a plain and real depiction of how all of us acted when we were that age. The average movie always leaves me laughing or feeling entertained for the night, but very so often a dime piece will come along that leaves you in awe feeling nostalgic for days about your own childhood. And then there are the actors - how could I possibly forget about them? River Phoenix with his heart-gripping scene about the milk money, Whil Wheaton so believably portraying a quiet and vulnerable boy who had lost his brother, Corey Feldman evoking so much anger and hurt through the words he says and the emotion in his eyes, and then Jerry O'Connell-just being plain old, clumsy Vern. Rob Reiner also did a fantastic job to have the ability to take a Stephen King novel and turn it into a heartwarming tale that still held the ""spooky"" element to it all. Filled with an outstanding cast and beautiful theme song, it is no wonder this is a movie I cannot seem to go a year without watching. It is definitely a must see for anyone who feels they want to relive their past every now and again. Like the famous quote says, ""I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?""",
472,31 July 2003,BornItalian67,10, I never forgot this movie...,"I watched this movie on the Disney channel when I was 11 years old.  I was freaked out by the dead boy's body.  I have never fogotten that movie. Years later, I picked up this movie to see it again with new eyes and to see it again for River Pheonix.  When I was 11, I didn't know who this kid was in the movie.  River plays Chris Chambers, probably the most interesting character next to DuChamp's and Ace's.  River plays this character well, and so do all of the other actors in their roles.  This movie is a classic with little flaws.  I love it.  See this movie for great drama, characters, jokes, and River Pheonix.",

I have never seen this movie until tonight and a lot of people have been bugging me to watch it so I finally did and i normally don't give any movies 8 Stars but this one blew me away and it actually made me cry at the end on this movie. It's full of emotions. These are how friendships work and should work. Yes I understand this is back in the 80s but this is a true film that's close to the heart. This movie delivers awesome work awesome directorship and Awesome everything.. I mean I can't think of any bad things about this film. I wish it was a little bit longer and explored the adulthood of these children that are playing in the movie.. yes there is a few bullying scenes which went along in the 50s and up through the 80s so you got to take the good and the bad with that. the characters played in this film are awesome .i give them100% credit and would love to see another movie like this. You don't see a lot of movies like this anymore it is a true classic and I would definitely watch it again. I'm not going to give out spoilers and tell you how it ends and tell you how it goes because like I said I have never seen this before it's my first time and I was really Blown Away so much that again I wanted more of it.,

Even though it is rated R (the only reason would be for language and young kids smoking). Will Wheaten(Gordie), River Phoenix(Chris),Corey Feldman(Teddy) and Jerry O'Connell(Vern) play the four boys who go out on an adventure to find the missing body of a boy. They wish that if they find him they would be sort of famous and looked up at.  But as those 4 look for the body, so does the violent teen gang led by Kiefer Sutherland(Ace). In the end it works out. The acting was great! Will and River were excellent as best friends and of course Corey and Jerry played there parts very well. Kiefer was perfect as a gang leader. The perfect movie to learn from and just to love to have in your home!!!!!!!LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!",

I haven't seen it for a while. Only remebered the scene with the bloodsuckers. It's still more horrifing than every horror movie I've seen. And then it's about where you come from and where you go. About friendship that is important but on the other hand friends will come and go. So watch this movie, expect nothing and be suprised about how it makes you feel in the end. What else is there other than people who touch your life for a while? If you are lucky, it's mutual like with these four characters. I like how they try to figure it out.

A very good dramatic performance by all the actors, my favorite performance is by River Phoenix. When he talks about him stealing the milk money. It was very touching.

I decided to watch this since it's considered a classic. I'll just be blunt. This movie sucks. I wasted an hour and 28 minutes of my life. Movies this old need to at least capture you in the story since the acting of the 80's and 90's is laughable in modern times. 
Stand By Me is nothing more than a boring story of 4 kids following train tracks to see a dead body. It gives shallow meaning of ""young friendship"" and feels like a crappy version of The Sandlot. If you want to watch a classic King adaptation, watch Shawshank Redemption instead.",
489,11 September 2018,minjaandjelkovic,10, Absolutely love it,"I'm 37 now and I am watching this movie after so many years again, AND I ENJOYED IT EVEN MORE.
Great plot, characters built so well, their mutual relationship, each kid has its own personal drama evolving inside themselves, their own little 'demons' tormenting them.
Anyway, I personaly think that childhood, especially the age these boys are, is so delicate, sensitive and overly important for their mental development. 
River Phoenix - this kid, and he was still a kid even when he died, could have been one of the greatest actors of all times. Wonderful, wonderful actor! He's the soul and heart of this movie. If nothing else, watch it because of him and the character that he potrays.",

491,25 July 2013,rvoccerace,8," After the death of a friend, a writer tells the story of a journey to find a body that him and his 3 friends went on as a boy.","Stephen King's ""Stand by Me,"" is a movie about friendship and the freedom and innocence of adolescence. The main characters in the movie are Gordie Lechance, Chris Chambers, Vern Tessio, and Teddy Duchamp. Each one of them have imperfect lives that perfectly reveal who they are and how they act. Chris Chambers is the hard nosed kid in the friendship. The way that he talks about his father and the fact that he smokes suggests that he lives a hard life and that he is thought of badly by his peers. Gordie Lechance is the leader in the friendship. Gordie struggles with the emotional gap that he cant seem to fill in between him and his parents. You will find out why his parents have gone astray from him once you get later on into the movie. Vern Tessio is the gullible klutz of the group. He is often seen being teased by the other 3 boys. And last but not least Teddy Duchamp. Teddy is the free spirited member of the group that is crazy and likes to take risks. But don't let that fool you, behind all of his smiles and jokes there is a wall of emotion just waiting to cave in. When I watched this movie I felt that there was never a dull moment. I feel that for every part in this movie there is something to be learned. And for that, ""Stand by Me,"" has easily become one of my favorite films and it will be of great benefit to those who watch it.",

My personal favorite was Chris Chambers, played by the late River Phoenix. His acting was phenomenal! When he broke down and spilled out his emotions I felt his pain. Sometimes my mom will automatically accuse me of things and sometimes my teachers will and they don't even let me have a say in anything. I just get in trouble right away.

495,28 December 2017,georgepsoady,9, Captures a transitional and strange period in our childhood like very other films can.,"Stand By Me is a brilliant film. This isn't because the ""direction is great"" or because ""the soundtrack sounds is nostalgic"", its because it does something very few films can, and that is to capture the transitional period from child to teenager. It is brutally honest and at times even too personal. This is shown brilliantly at the end of the movie when its protagonist, Gordie Lachance, now a man with two kids and a successful career as a writer, typing these exact words into his computer: ""Do we really ever have friends as good as the ones when we were twelve?"". That one line left a massive gulp in my throat for an hour the film ended, showing this really is one of the best coming-of-age films there is (and probably ever will be).",

I popped it in to see what I had forgotten about, and I found myself crying more than once. It sent a message that children should be receiving very early on. It's a movie about friendship and loyalty. I think my favorite scene was the 'Milk Money' scene. I found myself crying with Christopher Chambers about his dramatic loss and how everyone thought nothing of the 'low-life Chambers kid.' ",

I was the same age as the characters when this came out and I thought it was a cool story about running away with your friends.
As an adult I realized it wasn't just about the death of a child named ray Brower, it was about the death of childhood and innocence. Just like the train, you can dodge it and try to escape it for a while, but eventually, time and age will hit you like a train and knock you out of your keds.
As an adult with kids, I now watch it and it hurts thinking about my own middle schoolers growing up. But the thing I never thought much about was Gordie's parents. They mourn Denny so much that they fail to recognize the great kid they still have.",

My first time watching gave me a weird feeling of relating to my father, because he was the same age as the main characters during the film. If I want to go deep, I can say the train tracks represent the path of life, searching for something, but finding more along the way. Confronting obstacles and eventually having to choose your own path. It also encapsulates that feeling of going into the unknown, high school, college, marriage, parenthood, life. Still never forgetting the false sense of innocence of childhood. This is a movie that will forever be there, like a friend, family member or journal.",

514,13 July 2006,mermaid131810,10, One of my absolute FAVORITE films ever made...,"I don't think in all my 14 years that a movie like this has ever touched me so much. I was motivated to see it because I am a huge River Phoenix fan (not those dorky obsessive kind haha) but I got so much more out of it. The acting from these kids was absolutely breathtaking; they each portrayed their characters wonderfully. It was a good start for all of them. Since I am a girl and never really felt the ""12 yr old boy friends"" I didn't think it would relate to me as much but I was very wrong. The imagery was beautiful and it was somewhat believable. The jokes made me laugh out loud, all alone, in my computer room (I am listening to it behind this window as i type); especially the scene where Gordie shoots the garbage can and the jokes about the peoples ""mothers"" are hilarious too I make them all the time and I thought it was some new age thing but guess not! This is a 10 star film, no doubt, and completely worth seeing. I liked it more than the Godfather even. The language, even though people have found it too over-the-top, was hilarious. It's hilarious hearing these 12 yr old boys telling each other to f*** their moms because I've heard it all before and it's even funnier on camera. PLEASE WATCH THIS FILM YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!",
515,7 June 2013,siminel,10, They don't make movies like this anymore,"Stand By Me a nostalgic remembrance of a friendship between four twelve year old boys, during a period when they're just young enough to talk about cartoons and be afraid of the dark, and old enough to use cuss words and smoke cigarettes, and their biggest childhood adventure. They all have their own emotional problems and that's what makes their friendship so endearing to the viewer. The plot revolves around Gordie, an adult now with kids of his own, writing about the summer when his group friends found out about the location of a boy's dead body, a boy they all knew. Believing that it's what will bring them at least local fame, they set out to be the first who discover it, in the end competing with a much older gang. Stand by me is one of those movies that, no matter your gender, how old you are or how many times you've already seen it, it moves you. It makes you think of your childhood friends, the ones you haven't seen or heard in a long time and wonder if they think about you too, from time to time. The summers you spent in their company, playing or searching for a grand new adventure or when the adventure found you. This movie has those type of characters that are easily to relate to, even as a grown up. A brilliant masterpiece with heartwarming insights , the ecranisation of Stephen King's novella ""The Body"" will stand the passing of time because in every generation, there will be people who would find a bit of themselves in it. I give it 10/10.",
516,21 August 2000,henkelrocker,10, One of the best,"Well, what can I say. According to me this is probably one of the best films ever made. The acting is just great. River Phoenix has the role of his life and Kiefer Sutherland plays his part wonderful. Stand by me is absolutely believable, you can really see yourself in those guys. The best scene is when Gordie, Chris, Teddy and Vern sits in the woods, smoking cigarettes and talking about Disney characters and TV-shows. Those guys were born to act. If you haven't seen it, do so. You will be thrilled. Rob Reiner turns Stephen Kings great story into a masterpiece. And hey, the soundtrack is great too. Classic songs from the 50s. I'd give it a 10/10",

And soon thereafter elected it to be my favorite film of all time.The acting was of a standard I had never seen before. I mean you could really believe that they were real people, not just characters played by actors. Unbelievably talented ones at that. Stand By Me is the kind of film where you can laugh along with the characters, and cry with them to(and cry I'm sure many of you Stand By Me fans did). The kind of film that, each time you watch, you find something you missed the time before. This film reminds you that life is short, and friendships are much shorter.

As the plot line progresses, they make up an excuse and plan to set off to find a teenagers dead body. They are so interested in finding this boy because he is the same age as the boys. As they set off, many obstacles and great fears are in their way, including the sound of night, leeches and more.

Gordie is the sensitive and intelligent boy played so well by Wil Wheaton, Chris is the ""bad kid"" as he has been labeled but brings the peace when something is wrong played wonderfully by River Pheonix. Teddy is crazy yet sensitive, at least about his dad, played by Corey Feldman (i love the seen where he's standing guard and he wont shut up and let the other boys sleep.) And Vern the scaredy cat of the group played by Jerry O'Connel. Plus an excellent performance by Keifer Sutherland as the very mean and dangerous Ace.

It revolves around Gordie Lachance, a sensitive boy who lost his brother and feels unloved and unappreciated by his dad. So when he hears of the body, he and his three friends, Chris Chambers, Teddy Duchamp and Vern Tessio, embark on a long journey down the train tracks to find it. The one scene that drove me to tears and I can never forget is when Gordie breaks down and cries over how his dad hates him and Chris, played beautifully by River Phoenix (may he rest in peace) is there to support him and make him feel good about himself and to be honest I think this film should have had two Oscars.

This film, although made in 1986 (i say this because of the amazing enhancements in technology in the past decade)chills me, and i cannot help taking a moment after the film's completion to regain a sense of bliss about the world. Because Stand By Me poses many questions about one's self- Who really are my mates? Are they worth living for? Are they worth dying for? And as River Phoenix portrays (brilliant actor) some things in the world are worth risking for, as his character fades into the winds of memory. I cannot help feel a sense of bereavement for River, seven years after the film, his character really does evaporate and it will be ten years this october (2003) since his death. Facing the dawn of youth, this film about four inquisitive kids grasps the inspiration they find in each other to carry on and live for each other- no matter what their parents think of them, they have three other mates that will make them laugh when things are bad, revamp their spirit when all is lost and make them cry because these times cannot last forever.",

The story depicts the memories of four friends who share their neighbor and schools tangled themselves in an adventure that they will remember for their rest of the lives. It was nearly impossible to handle the film for that long for that age and they did it quite surprisingly.

I was one of the middle grandchildren for my grandparents, and had a lot of cousins that were substantially older than me, so I did a lot of looking up towards them.

Its another movie where somebody retells a part of his life, usually these kinds of movies can either turn into a disaster or masterpiece. Gordie Lachance played by Wil Wheaton is a boy who lives in a small town, hes in a gang with three others, his best friend Chris Chambers who comes from a bad family, the crazy Teddy Duchamp and the last one in the gang Vern Tessio. All four have some trouble in their families. One day Vern tells the gang about a dead body in a forest outside of town, and they decide to try to find this body.

The pie eating scene, the leach scene, the dog scene, the dead body scene. I remember talking about all of them for hours with my friend as a kid. Even though we all saw the film we'd stand around or sit around and talk about it and describe it to each other like we'd never seen it before. I have a friend that died and friends that I haven't seen in ages and when I re-watched this movie memories of them ran through my head. It made me sad and happy both at the same time.

As he got used to the idea, he wrote a 4-novella's containing masterpiece, including 'Stand by me'. It's a genuine masterpiece telling of early teenager's chains of thoughts and displays realistically the fears, anxieties and all other important issues in 12-year old boy's minds. 'Stand by me' has a fantastic cast of, among others, Kiefer Sutherland and River Phoenix. The original title of the story, 'The body', was renamed 'Stand by me' after the title song, which occurs throughout the whole film in various adaptions and reflects the specific moods of the moment. I have seen this film in a time-span of about 8 years about 10 times. It seems crazy, but it's the truth. The film is perfect in all its aspects: beginning, plot, characters, '2nd level', and even ending (not one of King's strong points).The  film contains no gore, blood, monsters or non-realistic elements as we're used to of King, but is, next to 'The Shawshank Redemption', his best movie.

It isn't only the story of four boys who are searching the body of a missing boy, but also an important portrait of a genuinely and authentic friendship in 1950's USA. It bind four boys, all in a very abandoned and pitiable condition. No affect. Only this friendship. So, the boys try to find affect in their friends. All need affect but we see especially Gordie. He's the protagonist, a very sensitive boys, who first had a brother who make him happy, then (now), after the death of his brother, he hasn't anyone except his best friends Chris. Chris is abandoned. He hasn't anyone too except his best friend Gordie. I almost think that the research of the body is only the occasion to tell about this extraordinary genuine friendship.

It is a truly touching film that shows what the friendships of twelve year old boys in the 50s. It shows us what true friendships should be like and what it was like to be twelve in the mid-twentieth century. I have never spoken to anyone ( anyone mature) whose life wasn't majorlly impacted by seeing this film. Even though words can't express the beauty and honesty of this film, I'll try to do my best. It is true that this film is usually appreciated more by adults, but I believe it would be a shame if children didn't see it ( to fully appreciate their childhood and friends). The film is rated R for language, some use of tobacco, and some sexual references ( not too bad). If you are worried about showing it to your children think about this: the film teaches a good lesson about life and friends; that is worth letting them hear a few bad words.

562,20 April 2005,katiemidnight,9, A Nostalgic Treasure,"This movie, adapted from a book by Stephen King, is not like most of the horror films you may come to expect from this author. While yes, there is a sense or morbidity, this movie is really more about that moment in your adolescence when everything is changing, yet everything is just right. Stand By Me is about four boys who take a trip to see a dead body, and on the way find themselves growing up. There is just the right mix of boyhood (the fart jokes, the rhyming insults, the play-wrestling) and adulthood. The boys enjoy their time, yet are always looking ahead at school next year and whether their friendships will last. River Pheonix delivers an amazing performance as the kid that no one has faith in, and is one of the best child actors I have ever seen. When I heard that he was dead, I was disappointed; he would've been an even more amazing actor later on. Keifer Sutherland also did well as 'Ace', the bully chasing the four boys. He was sufficiently frightening enough to keep us on our toes throughout the movie. This movie is sweet, with a large dose of nostalgia. You want to remember when you were 12, what it was like. You want the boys to succeed in their future, which seems so uncertain. All in all, the line that really sums it up is the last line of the movie: ""I never had friends quite like the ones I had when I was 12 years old. But h***, does anybody?""",

In fact some of them were haunted by their roll in this movie straight out of a career. It's one of those magic moments when everything comes together exactly right, growing up pains and the effects death has on life rarely found a better expression in a movie or anywhere else.

But Stand By ME is still one of the most moving experiences on film, even though i am now nearly 19years old.  The acting from the four kids was superb considering there age, particular mention must be made of the late river phoenix, who brought chris chambers to life.  The reason the movie is so good is because in ways it reminds us of the way we were at 12 years old.

This movie was very pleasing starting with the great characters that couldn't have played there roles any better and story that could relate to anyone. It is very sad at times but mostly has some hilarious moments with the kids. and also Stephen king is a very good author and writer so u must check out some of his other great classic movies.",

This movie is well written, has excellent character actors and is one of my favorite movies. ""The Body"" is an excellent novella which if you enjoy the film as much as I did, I highly recommend reading it. The transportation of 4 childhood friends from innocence to realizing what happens in the rest of the world is wonderfully captured in this movie. The actors used for the parts were almost as I imagined them whilst reading the novella. Overall if you want to see an excellent film, watch this movie.",

585,23 August 2015,santosmontes,8, Rob Reiner know's how to adapt Stephen King's greatest novels,"---SPOILER REVIEW---- As I start to commence into the greatest hits of Stephen King, I can't say I've actually read ""The Body"" (Novelization of Stand By Me) However I have read Misery, and Rob Reiner obviously knows what he's doing with his source material. Stand By Me is about a journey of four boys of junior high age. What they intended on their journey wasn't the life changing revelations that succumbed in the events of the movies, but simply to find a dead body, bring it in and hopefully attain fame from it. Gordie, Chambers, Teddy and Vern, each fill their own role in the gang. Gordie is the protagonist of the story, and his revelation revolves around the death of his seemingly perfect brother, Denny, who's always supported Gordie no matter the judgment of his father, who's only ever cherished the accomplishments of Denny, while sweeping Gordie under the rug. There is a moment in the middle of the movie where Gordie is having a dream of his brothers funeral. Everyone is looking down at Denny's grave. Gordie's father puts his hand on Gordie's shoulder saying ""It should've been you."" Now I wasn't sure if this was actually what happened during the funeral, but Gordie wakes up directly after this, explaining to Chris(Chamber) that he didn't cry at his brother's funeral. This is presumably to point out the fact that during the dream, Gordie did not cry during the funeral so this could also mean that his father really did tell him that he'd with Gordie had died instead of Denny. This is portrayed in the movie's great use of dialogue in certain situations such as Gordie and Chamber's heart to heart conversations. Though the dialogue portrayed throughout most of the movie comes off as cheesy and unrealistic in terms of how the youth would speak otherwise, this could have just been dialogue taken from Stephen King's novel. Again, I didn't read the book, and I wasn't born in the 50's. Anyways, I thought the movie was great, and definitely sent an inspiring message to those who aspire to do something great for themselves. These are my basic feelings about the movie and the moments that stuck out to me most. 1,000 words isn't enough for a full review unfortunately.",
586,14 July 2016,amoschneider,8, Loved it!,"Absolutely loved this film,its a short but fun packed film with lots of adventure. The relationship that the characters have with each other is very beautiful i could really relate to their feelings. It is a very bittersweet film but also contains humor, i could defiantly watch it again. There were quite a lot i movie mistakes that i noticed but it didn't effect the quality of the film. It is a very memorable film that really makes you reflect on life. I loved the plot and the acting was very real to watch. Its a lovely teenage movie but is also a good film to watch with the family if you get the chance, this is defiantly one of my favorite films and its really worth watching!",

I love river and Corey! If you haven't seen this film YOU MUST ! Corey and river are great actors and make this film realistic, they couldn't have chosen any one better to play there roles. My favourite part has to be when they are singing and running down the train track, it reminds me of when i was about 10/11 and how sad i was hahaha as me and my friends used to play on a run down train track near my house, but then they all moved and we have all grown up a little , so it reminds me of some of my memories....i give it 10 Star's ********** !",

The second or third time i watched it i got this strange feeling about it and realized i loved it. I feel the same exact feeling when i watch it to this day. I felt a bit guilty not knowing whether i liked the movie itself or just River Phoenix but i came to find that it is a brilliant film and is also very heart warming. The whole plot was unique and i respect both Stephen King and Rob Reiner for displaying a marvelous and beautiful story to the world.

593,30 August 2000,mike-176,9, Truest View of Youth Ever !!!,"How a guy in his forties can remember being twelve this well is a miracle to behold!!  The simpler times, the incredibly close ties of youth, the miraculous acting by such young actors - River Phoenix was better than 99% of the adult actors in that year or any other.  Plus, the drama is tight. Scenes like the train on the bridge, the dog in the junkyard and the leaches in the swamp all kept the thrills coming while this truly human story stayed true to it's recollections of youth.  Even the comedic element was carefully balanced into the mix of movie magic.  With the tubby kid as the brunt of most jokes and scenes like the pie-eating contest with ""Lardass"" starting the biggest barf festival ever, this movie had every element of great entertainment and true art - because it told the truth about the realities of youth;  how scary and truly barbaric the bullies of youth are, how incredibly horrible adults can be to kids and how damaging it can be to their self-esteem, and then how amazing it is when kids can surprise everyone and do something nobody expects of them, because they've forgotten about the courage that can be exhibited when children  or anyone does the unthinkable because they don't think about or know the consequences that can come from their actions. All and all a great movie.",
594,19 September 1998,K_Tofu,10, This film is so good. A masterpiece.,"This film is funny, nostalgic and so amazingly true to life that you can't stop thinking about it for days. The acting is superb flawless. Looking back on our childhood is something we all do from time to time and this film relives such things that we have all experienced from time to time. It is really heavy in parts and makes you think about stuff. The pie eating contest is the ultimate. So witty and well done. What more can you say about such a film. Has the best final line of any film I have ever seen.",
595,3 October 1998,Rohan,10, A superbly made movie,"My congratulations must go to Rob Reiner on being able to so faithfully maintain the candour and innocence of Stephen King's wonderful storyline.

This movie is ""a must"" and possibly the only thing that can make me wish I was 12 years old again. If you have the chance, I suggest you get the dvd release. It has a good featurette and a commentary track by director Rob Reiner.",

River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell do a tremendous job in this movie. This movie brings back the childhood of every one who watches it.  To get a taste of the 50s and early 60s, watch this movie!!!  Or just to see some very good actors in action, watch it.  Rob Reiner did an excellent job on this movie. This is his little gem!!!!",
601,4 December 2000,jenkins_8211,10, One line can't do this film justice!!,"I've never met anybody who doesn't like this film. I don't believe there is anyone!! Regardless of those 89 people who voted that it was rubbish. This film is wonderfully cast and definitely does the book(Different seasons, the body, Stephen King) justice which is a change as when literature takes to celluloid it usually manages to get somewhat 'mangled' along the way. However, Rob Reiner captures perfectly the very qualities that made the book so special. This is a film that must be watched by everyone before making a decision. It's too easy to say 'that sounds boring'. as Steven King appropriately states in the book ""The most important things are the hardest to say because words diminish them. It's hard to make strangers care about the good things in your life"". I'd just like to add at the end of my review, Stand by me beat that timeless classic Top Gun to the number one spot in box office ratings!",

Set in Castle Rock, a small town on the north-eastern side of Oregon, four young boys set out a life-changing journey to find a missing body that was rumored to be located near a local riverbank. While on this journey, the group of young teens experiences many valuable events that not only change who they are on the surface but also fundamentally change their outlook on life.

Best movie ever you have to see it and don't listen to any one else they are all wrong if they say its bad. The theme song in this movie is obviously Stand By Me by Ben.E. King.

609,2 May 2001,sakiko,9, Exquisite. What else?,"i would firstly like to apologize for the poor quality of my English, and also to express my frustration and regret for not possessing a rich enough vocabulary to convey my feelings towards this film. But anyway. I first saw stand by me when i was- must have been about 10 years old. At the time, those boys in the film were `big boys` to me and i remember how sweetly river phoenix's flawless profile remained in my innocent childhood memory for days after seeing it, and the very surreal sense of loss and grief i felt when my sister gently told me that he was already not with us anymore. I have been watching this film at least once every year since then for 8 years, and although this is such a cliche the more i see it the more I derive. It's like a film that teases out the knots that form in your heart as you get older, and every time i see it i feel so small again, so unspoiled and vulnerable. No other film has the same effect on me, and i won't bother going into detail about exactly whose amazing acting captivates me and how much of a genius Stephen King is- i don't think all that makes for enjoyable reading when coming from people you don't know. Stand By Me is a beautiful work of art that simply flows- flows right into the forgotten and dehydrated part of our hearts.",

Amazing acting, notably from the 4 boys [Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O' Connell]. Who would have thought that Rob Reiner could get such a performance out of these 4 boys?, one at the time (Jerry O' Connell) was only of the age 11!

This film stars River Phoenix, Jerry O'Connell, Corey Feldman and Wil Wheaton, as anyone would say, these 4 boys were incredibly talented and really put 101% into their characters and really lived in the film, doing what any young boys would've done at 12-16.

And who could forget the late River Phoenix, As leader of this small gang he leads his friends to see a dead body yet in the end thats not what the movie turns out to be about. Each boy goes through an emotional journey during the movie and as each scene goes by more and more about each of these misfits is revealed. It's certainly a great coming of age movie that all boys will relate to, however that doesn't mean that the girls out there won't love this one- just as much as me.",
621,2 December 2006,martin_reynolds,10, The memories of Childhood,"This is my favourite film of all time. The story line helps the viewer envisage the times of when he/she were young, without responsibilities and always looking for adventure. Isn't it weird that everybody seemed to have 4 close friends when they were young and one of these being the most loyal you could wish for. Stand by Me is the epitome of everything that being young represented. The viewer is taken back to when they were young and whilst watching the film they also watch their past through the memories the film forces through, all from the relationship with your best friend to the fact that some friend do just become another face in the hall, even though you grew up and matured together. the whole experience forces you to watch it again and again even though every time it makes you sadder and sadder. its an extremely powerful film with 4 great actors acting superb. just wish there were more like it. 10/10",

Based off the great Stephen King short story, ""The Body"", it is a tale about youth, growing up, bullies, bad relationships with parents and friendship. The plot is about 4 friends who find out about a teenager who was hit by a train a couple miles down the train-track, and set out to find his dead body. Each kid has family issues. Gordie's (Wil Wheaton) close brother who was loved more than him died in a car crash a year previously and his parents couldn't care less about him. Chris (River Phoenix) has two rebel brothers which gives him an instant bad rep and the fact that the town thinks he stole lunch money from school doesn't help it. Teddy (Corey Feldman) has a mental father who burnt both of his ears off on a stove and Teddy is almost as crazy as him. And Vern (Jerry O'Connell) is the chubby runt-of-the-pack who also has a rebel for a brother. The four characters have great chemistry and give entertaining and funny conversations. The film perfectly captures the environment, expressions and style of the 50's. There are several intense, surprising, funny and sad moments in this great adaptation. It is one of my favorite films.",
629,5 March 2002,Courtney15,10," best movie ever, fickle as i am, can't beat this one, period.","If you have not yet seen this movie you must.  I think anyone who goes through they're life, especially childhood, without seeing this movie is seriously missing out ona  great plot, great quotes, and great acting. The acting is so spectacular that i am inspired to try to become an actress myself.  After watching this movie, River Phoenix's death was so much closer to the bone, he could've been larger than life and to me, and i bet lots of others, he already was in his short time on the earth.  Wil Wheaton was the most adorable thing in the world in this movie and having seen picture of him today, he hasn't lost that cuteness he had in '86.  Corey Feldman, awesome, just great, i wish he would appear in more stuff today, ""The Lost Boys"" and ""Stand By Me"" make you love him soo much, he just attaches to you. The characters are so real even if you're a girl, an adult, or a boy with a childhood exactly like this.  The characters are so real, so undescribably cool and soooooo well portrayed.  The actors are even more lovable because they are close to their characters, Rob Reiner (director of Stand By Me) says you must cast them that way because they have not ""developed the craft [of acting].""  So they really are like that!! It makes me so happy to know those guys are so real, very comforting in this new world of mondo-commercialization.",
630,11 July 2002,foamrat,10, a timeless tale,"whether you went in search of a dead body in the 1960s or played neighborhood flashlight tag in the 1980s, this film brings out a sense of nostalgia for all.",
631,23 March 2003,bestactress,10, Truly a masterpiece! i love it!,"I saw this movie when i was younger and i still absolutley love it. the story itself is just brillant. the actors fit with charaters great! whil wheaton did a fabulos job playing the dramatic kid. river phoniex fit the bad boy with a soft heart image. corey feldman did an awesome job as the ""big mouth"" type of kid. and jerry o'connell did a treffic as the fat , not to smart but still funny kind of character! The movie let you see that even a boy or man can still cry. It had a great message. Simply the 4 boys ,who realy dont have much family, turn to the only people who can understand and help them in a time of need, their best friends. and its so sweet. This movie is and will always remain my favorite of ALL TIME! If you didnt enjoy this movie the first time watch it again and it will be your favorite too! God Bless.",
632,16 November 2002,e_duboulay,9," Not a synopsis, but a description.","This is a beautiful, moving film.  Wil Wheaton delivers an innocent and emotional performance, while River Phoenix acts as the tough kid, protecting Wil, suberbly.  The story is a sad yet uplifting one, and a melancholy rendition of Ben E King's song Stand By Me, washes over the film. All in all I would thoroughly recommend this movie to those who enjoy tales of friendship, suspense and possibly a good cry.  Watch out for Kiefer Sutherland, too, as 'Ace' the vicious gang leader of a group of thugs.",
633,12 April 2003,Milos_11,10, Very good story.,"Although I watched it only few months ago, I liked it, I really do. Very good story, talking about 4 truly friends and their adventures. I was very sorry when I found out that River (Chris) died, cause, even he was a drug addict, no young man deserves to die. At least if there was no way for him to find a way out of that hell, his friends should helped him to fight with it, with everything what they could do, and never to give up. Rest in peace my friend.",
634,4 May 2004,charlotterance,10, Beautiful movie which made me think...,I first watched this movie when I was about 13 - and I never forgot it. I never saw it again until about 5 months ago - I'm nearly 17 now.,
635,1 February 2003,YvonneNewZ,10, Worth watching a million times...,"If you feel lonely and depressed, this is the film to watch. This great film of a unique friendship reminds you what it was like to be a kid hanging out with your friends, going on adventures etc.",
636,20 February 2003,pollystewart,10," ""stand by me"" shows that children are more than capable of understanding, feeling and participating in previously described ""adult concepts"".","Modern ""coming of age"" Dramas seem to display notions of people under 15 years of age being innocents, free from corruption and unaware of tensions between associates of different sexes. Then along comes a catalyst in the shape of going to high school, making a new friend etc. and  all of a sudden a child becomes an adolescent, free from illusions and aware of adult issues. Usually the ""coming of age"" drama is focused around these issues; of first noticing the opposite sex, of the discovery of a ""generation gap"" between the subject/s and their parents/guardians, of the discovery of swearing and drinking and occasionally drugs. The thing I liked about this movie is that it highlights the fact that awareness of these issues does not come exclusively with puberty. The characters in this movie smoke, swear, tell dirty jokes, discuss sex, and hate their parents all before hitting their ""Teens"". It shows that it is naive to assume that it takes 15 years for a child to realise that there is a ""generation gap"" existing in their household. It also displays an underlying concept that many children are capable of acheiving personal skills that many adults are incapable of; that is the ability to make decisions and stick to them, the ability to lead a group, the ability to take care of themselves, and the ability to problem solve within a group. This concept, that many children depend on their parents for economic support more than emotional support is an edgy one and one that forces veiwers to redefine their mental image of the ""child"".",
637,2 February 2010,forsling-ida,10, it is good.,"It is about four boys , who have heard about a dead boy. All four have different private problems is evident in the film again. Chris has such a big brother, Eyeball, who is leader of a gang of older and known as the city's Habit. Chris has also had a negative image so that he, for example, will always be charged in school when something is lost or destroyed. Gordie is the intelligent. His older brother has recently died. His brother was a popular and talented guy and Gordie feel as if his parents, especially his dad, think it should have been Gordie who died instead. They have heard about a dead guy in their age in the wood. The police have not found him yet, the four friends go out and look for him. I like that all four have problems home but when they are together they live like a little "" dream world "". The movie is profound and to see their friendship make me happy !",
638,16 August 2010,squirrlmonkey,10, I can't get enough,"I recently found ""Stand By Me"" in a closing Blockbuster and in about a week. Since, I have seen it 7 times, 8 if you count the time I watched the Directors Commentary. Everything is great, the acting, the setting, the train scene, with Vern and Gordie, shoot. Like the way the train looked; and the music throughout the entire movie. Corey Feldmen, River Phoenix, and Keifer Sutherland were all spectacular. My favorite scene is where Teddy goes crazy at the junkyard. When I looked at ""Walking the Tracks: The Summer of Stand By Me,"" Rob Reiner says that Corey Feldmen truly had a lot of anger. I see that every time I watch (witch would be many,many times). Truly an unforgettable movie.",
639,6 October 2013,Phoenixboy92,10, Nostalgia at it's best,"This movie brings forth all of the feelings of being a pre-teen and spending a summer of adventure with your friends. The bond between them is expertly portrayed and never overdone which i found rare. The acting of the four boys is superb and natural for the most part, Reiner did a wonderful job directing them. Speaking as a huge fan this is Phoenix at his pure best. Truly haunting. If you enjoy reminiscing then this is a great movie for you! The spectrum of emotions portrayed and invoked in this movie makes this one of the best to have come out of the eighties... Strike that, THE best. Add to all of this the fantastic music and the stunning scenery this is a must see.",
640,26 April 2003,babygemini88,10, One of the best movies I have ever seen.,"I have seen a lot of films in my time (I am a fourteen year old female) but never before have I seen a movie so uplifting and memorable as this film is. It is a dynamic coming-of-age film about 4 young boys who set out to find the body of 12 year old, Ray Brower. The casting was brilliant and the plot was magnificent. Rob Reiner directed this movie beautifully and I'm sure Stephen King was impressed as this was an adaptation of his novella 'The Body'. I've watched this movie over and over again and I think I have grown to love it even more. **** 1/2 out of 5",
641,29 June 2003,riversedge-1,10, best movie about friendship,"one of the best movies ever made. rob reiner directed a great movie about four boys growing up an having an adventure finding a dead body(story by stephen king) the actors are great, especially RIVER PHOENIX.",
642,13 July 2003,Rubles,10, The best movie I've seen in years!!,Stand by me is a very moving film. I used to watch it every day when i lived in the UK but i hardly get the chance now that i am in Turkey. It is one of River Phoenix's best films.I have also read the novel 'the body' by Stephen King it is also really good but the film is better!,
643,18 August 2022,gerietis,7, Almost good,"The movie is Almost good. I have read the Novel recently - this movie is accurate till some point. Looks like there was no money left in the end...

God, I don't think there will ever be another movie of that kind that lives up to its standards. The incredible acting and intense bonding really shine and the thing that really got me was River Phoenix. His character of Chris is one of the deepest, most touching characters I've ever seen.",

647,2 November 2003,lilmizreddevil,10, How it is telling what i think of the film and the actors.,"The film is full of so much, just got on dvd and watched over 10 times in the last month.

It's themes are wonderful, true, sad, and a life-long lesson. I get chills every time that I watch this movie. It is such a wonderful account on life and the four young actors do a tremendous job with their performances. I think this movie should have definitely won Oscars. It is definitely Oscar potential and it is a shame that these actors were not more publicly known.",
