0,20 February 2021,evansjoshyr,10, One of the best films ever made,"17 years after incredibles was released, it continues to be a compelling, entertaining, funny, smart, ambitious, original, mature and just simply enjoyable movie. The dialogue is exceptional and the animation holds up surprisingly well. The characters are well written and very fleshed out. It is an animated film about superheroes and yet the chatacters and world feel so real.",/
1,5 November 2004,Quinoa1984,10, My favorite film from Pixar in over five years- Bird and company produce a triumph of a family film,"Writer-director Brad Bird here has something that I was caught off-guard by just a bit. I always expect Pixar films to be above-par, family entertainment, the kinds of films that can have an appeal to adults on a satirical, jab-in-the-side effect by having the characters reacting to each other as they would on a film with a higher rating, whilst giving the bright colors, action, and silliness that appeals to kids. Watching The Incredibles, their sixth feature-length offering, I wasn't so entertained and amused since their 98 film A Bug's Life, and it almost brought me back to the emotional impact I felt when in the theater for the first time getting Toy Story into my system.

4,19 December 2004,jon.h.ochiai,10, Truly Incredible,"I finally saw Pixar/Disney's ""The Incredibles"" after several scheduling glitches. Writer and Director Brad Bird's ""The Incredibles"" is truly incredible. It is one of the best movies of the year. The CGI animation is both cutting edge and simply stunning, and like all Pixar projects it has a solid story as it's foundation. Bird uses the Superhero mythology to tell a funny and poignant story: that when we forfeit or withhold our greatness, we are not being true to ourselves, and more importantly it is a disservice to those around us. As the story begins, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) was the superhero's Superhero. As voiced by Nelson, Mr. Incredible, is very confident, on the verge of cocky. He uses his super strength and powers for good. He marries super, Elasticgirl (Holly Hunter). However, Mr. Incredible soon falls victim like his fellow ""Supers"" to the plight of our litigious society-- the people they save are suing them. Instead of getting malpractice insurance (which would have been a different movie), the persecuted... and prosecuted Supers assume their secret identities in a covert government relocation program. They also promise never to use their powers again even for good.",i

6,17 February 2008,ccthemovieman-1,8, Good Entertainemt For About Any Age,"This was somewhat of a surprise hit when it came out in 2004. Most of the attention was on a competing animated film but this is the one that turned out to be a huge box-office success. Word of mouth helped his immensely. It's what made me check it out, as several friends recommended it. I wound up agreeing with them: it's excellent entertainment.",w

So, I did and feel in love with it.",/

Action is amazing, especially in the final act with such a range of powers all used brilliantly.
And do I need to say anything about the animation? Pixar just knocks it out of the park every time.
The Incredibles is just full of personality and charm, making it endlessly rewatchable.",r
9,26 April 2005,MovieAddict2016,9," Pixar's most ""epic"" animated film since ""Toy Story.""","Although ""The Incredibles"" is not the best film Pixar has released (via Disney) since 1995's ""Toy Story,"" I felt it is the most epic. When I went to go see ""Toy Story"" in 1995, the epic scale of the picture -- the non-stop frantic pace, the action sequences, etc. -- were all so breathtaking that it contained the same tour de force attitude as, believe it or not, a blockbuster such as ""Terminator 2"": a crowd-pleasing, overwhelming picture.",w
10,11 April 2005,claudio_carvalho,10, A Movie That Really Deserves to Be Among the IMDb Top 100,"After many unfair lawsuits against superheroes, inflicted by persons saved by them, the government requests the superheroes to retire and hide their identity as if they were normal citizens. Mr. Incredible marries Elastigirl, has three children (Violet, Dash and Jack Jack) and has a boring job in an insurance company. When a chance is offered to Mr. Incredible to become a hero again, he becomes happy and in shape. However, when the identity of the mysterious contractor is revealed, the family has to fight together against the evil Syndrome to stay alive. ""The Incredible"" is an amazing movie, and has superseded my best expectation of an animation. The story is excellent, having action and humor in right doses, the characters are very charismatic and it is a movie recommended as an excellent family entertainment. Today there are 528 comments, most of them favorable, and the movie is in top 250: #91. Therefore, I believe it is not necessary to extend my review. Last but not the least, ""The Incredible"" is a movie that really deserves to be among the IMDb Top 100. Lets wait for the inevitable sequel My vote is ten.",0
11,29 May 2014,silva-w-pius,9," Is it a bird, no it's a plane, no it's the Incredibles","Is it a bird, no it's a plane, no it's the IncrediblesImagine if one crazed scientist had a colossal sized blender and put the love and affection of The Modern Family in it, then sprinkled some dysfunctional madness of Malcolm in the Middle and then added superpowers to the mix, I guarantee that what comes out still won't be a match for the crazy, adorable, high octane and utter zaniness that are the Incredibles. The dad is supper strong, the mother can stretch like taffy, and the teenage girl can become invisible and throw up force fields and the 10 year old is lightening fast, which is quiet lucky when they must come up against the rich, genius of the villainous Syndrome, who seeks to destroy the hero he once worshipped in Mr. Incredible and an the whole city along with him. Despite the film being an animation featuring a story line that was extremely fantastical, not once did I remember it was a movie. The actions scenes were spell bounding and highly imaginative. But most importantly, I really believed in these characters that spat witty sharp dialogue at each other at a furious pace, not just because they were funny, but because the characters were so believable and relatable. Subsequently it should come as to no surprise that film was nominated for a best screenplay Oscar, which is a rarity for an animated film, but this ain't just your average animated film, it's an Incredible animated film",9

13,23 December 2004,ThePedofinderGeneral,9, Amazing! Brilliant! Fabulous! Wonderful! Astonishing! I'm not avoiding using a certain word!,"The Incredibles is a great film, and probably my favourite Pixar picture (Toy Story is the best, but that's different to favourite). It takes a while to properly get into the action, but when it does, it delivers it in spades.",2
14,16 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Excellent Pixar film, not the best one, but still very good!","I wasn't expecting The Incredibles to be as good as it was, it was inventive, funny and original, all the things that I look for in an animated film. I don't think it is Pixar's best, that's Toy Story, but it's certainly not the weakest, that's Cars though that was a worthy film as well. The animation is spot on, and just adds to the inventive feel of the film, and is helped enormously by an innovative plot that is the source of the film's originality. The story is very fast-paced, if perhaps a little slow to begin with, and the script is filled with humour to satisfy even the fussiest child. The characters are very well-done, thanks to the excellent voice cast, standouts are Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter, and My Name is Earl's Jason Lee is a big surprise as the villain Syndrome. Brad Bird's Edna was a hoot too. The film however, does have two flaws, it is overlong and sometimes drags consequently, and it is a little too violent at times, the last half-hour especially. Overall, an excellent family film, not perfect, but anybody who's seen some of the Disney direct to video sequels, save one or two exceptions will agree that the Incredibles does a much better job at entertaining than they did. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",2
15,17 January 2010,Tweekums,10, Lives up to its name,"On the face of it this may look like it is very much a film for children that will have little appeal to adults unless they are watching it with their children; this however would be a mistake as it has a good story that adults can enjoy too. Some aspects are clearly aimed at the adult viewer such as obvious references to James Bond, these are done in a way that people who don't see the reference won't get the impression that they are missing something.",4
16,21 July 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,9, It really is incredible.,"'The Incredibles (2004)' is a masterclass in character, always putting its central family in front of its superb superhero action. That action is often somewhat counter-intuitively but cleverly conveyed using the tropes and language of the spy genre, giving the movie a decidedly 60s flavour in the process. The piece is a much more mature affair than you might expect, being a family film in every sense of the word - a movie suitable for kids as opposed to one made for them. It is nuanced, affecting and will actually pay off more for the older members of its audience. It plays like a live-action picture with the world's most convincing special effects, since they're rendered exactly like the rest of the flick, and some of the most convincing characters, too. What makes the film so fantastic is that it's genuinely entertaining all the way through. It's properly funny, intriguing, suspenseful, emotionally impactful and exciting. What's so impressive is that it easily rises to the top of its genre, standing amongst the best of its peers (and even, in itself, commenting on them), despite being released when that very same genre was still in its infancy. It stands tall as apparent 'kid' fare that's far more mature than most 'adult' - or, at least, 'teen' - stuff being produced even today (over ten years after its release). It's effortlessly enjoyable and wonderfully conceived. Really, it's just incredible. 9/10",2
17,8 December 2005,MaxBorg89,10, The greatest adventure of 2004!,"The Incredibles is further proof Pixar focuses more on story and characters rather than in-jokes and celebrity voices, as in Dreamworks'features (not that there's anything wrong with that, just look at Shrek 1 AND 2). Okay, there are quite a lot of pop-culture references in this film, because of the story, but that doesn't stop The Incredibles from being an... incredible movie.",/

19,16 December 2004,coloradokatchoo,9, An Amazing Message Over Looked,"I am tired of reading reviews about how an animated film is too violent for children, deals with mature issues like segregation or death, or is simply ""too grown up"" for small children. Since when did we decide to water down the truth for children, and when exactly are they old enough for certain issues, and why is it animation means it's suppose to be for children. Animation has allowed movie makers to break molds, has allowed them to do things that could not be done with regular actors or locations. We use CGI to accomplish effects we otherwise couldn't do, why is the art of illustration not considered on the same level as the art of computer graphics? I don't feel that just because something is made for children it should be dumbed down and I don't believe that an adult is too superior to watching something that is animated. Stories geared toward children such as Aesop's Fables or the fairy tales of the brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Anderson, were told to teach life lessons; don't cry wolf, be happy with what you have and don't trust strangers. These are lessons, and stories, that were not watered down, that showed to what evil depths greed, slothfulness and envy, just to name a few, could take hold of in a person.",r
20,13 December 2019,acedj,9," Pixar's second best movie, but only just...","Nemo just slightly edges this out for me, but this movie is great just the same. It is filled with the kind of things that makes a life long superhero nerd smile and laugh. This is the story of a family of superheros that have adapted to civilian life. The reason for this? As the world became more litigious, people that were hurt collaterally by superheros started to sue for their injuries. This plot device is genius because it is so very believable. After years in retirement Bob Parr, AKA Mr. Incredible gets recruited for a mission by a mysterious person. Of course the person that recruits Bob has nefarious intentions, and unleashes a seemingly indestructible machine on the world. It is us the the Parrs, Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Violet and Dash, along with the family friend Frozone to save the day. I love that they cast Sam Jackson in the role as Frozone, because his super power is making ice, and Sam Jackson is the coolest MF out there. This is a great movie, not just from an animation stand point, but in the whole realm of superhero films as well.",e
21,12 December 2007,dataconflossmoor,10, INCREDIBLY!!!! Creative!!,"This website has ranked this film to be one of the top 250 films ever made...You want to know something, I totally agree with this verdict!! This high definition surreal film by the master of animation...Walt Disney, evoked a successful culmination of cinematic brilliance on a myriad of artistic production levels!! An accomplishment like this epitomizes the term ""entertaining"" in it's most resounding form!! In evaluating the initial premise of this film, it compounds the dilemma of the proverbial glory days being a thing of the past!! A guy who was a football hero in his school days whereby it was routine to score four touchdowns in a game, and eventually, it fades due to a knee injury or being out of shape or something, this signifies that his best days are over!! When a former head cheerleader who was the starlight of every male's eye, who counted on her good looks, and she loses them, her best days are over as well!! So too is the case of a family of superheroes who leaped through buildings at a single bound in a vigilante crusade to capture nefarious criminals!! Ultimately, their vicarious damage to buildings and citizens meant that the municipality had to insulate itself from any further pecuniary culpability, and relocate them!! This would seemingly suggest that the Incredible's best days are behind them also!! As is the case with so many has beens, the end result winds up being a case of the breadwinner getting relegated to the monotonous plight of an inane job such as an insurance salesman. Such mediocrity reduces the Mr and Mrs to the state of being sedentary and overly mortgaged!! This movie depicts how even a family of manufactured stick people representing the world of fantasy, cannot hide from the afflictions of mid-life crises!!!! The ultimate undoing in these superhero's lives are the non-visceral elements of banality such as; indemnity forms, traffic jams and paranoid nightmares about deteriorating marital trust!! Just as someone wants to be a star football player,or a head cheerleader, all over again, these Incredibles wish to return to their exciting lives as the superheroes who took on capital crime!! Such a plot is very innovative, the writing in this dressed up doggerel of entertainment was remarkable!! This movie has a succinctly homogeneous blend of voices which induce an appropriately heinous cacophony of emotions which effectively illustrate exuberance and despair!! The sound effects were outstanding in this movie!! The cinematography in ""The Incredibles"" was superb!! Middle class hang-ups have been injected into teenage movies and television ever since ""The Simpsons"". This trademark of domestic rancor is for purposes of appealing to a broader audience range!! I found this film to be an ingenious use of satire, while mastering a digitalized analog of intelligent caricatures!! ""The Incredibles"" is not just a kid's film, or an overgrown adolescent's film, it is for everybody!! The family was called the Incredibles, the movie is called FANTASTIC!!",f

26,3 February 2021,Doublej20005,10, One of my All-Time Favourites,"First of all, everything technically is more or less perfect. From the brilliantly stylised animation, character design, settings and background design and animation effects that were ground-breaking for the art form, to quite possibly my favourite score of all time from Michael Giacchino that I've been humming more or less constantly since I watched it, to the creative and extremely enjoyable action that uses all of the family's powers to their advantage, every technical aspect is just phenomenal. The voice acting is energetic, the characters are really iconic and their interactions are the main driving force of the film. I love the fact that, underneath the superhero aspect of their lives, this is just a normal family with normal interactions, which grounds the characters in a sense of reality and makes them a lot more enjoyable to watch, particularly in the final act. Brad Bird is pretty much a master at writing dialogue that appeals to both kids and adults, and the amount of layers that some of the dialogue has makes me shocked that a film like this was even made. There are a lot of darker undertones, such as Helen thinking that Bob is cheating on her, to Bob feeling like his life no longer has any meaning to it. It again makes the characters so much more enjoyable to watch and makes the story so much more layered. The pacing is pretty much pitch perfect, and Syndrome is one of the best villains of all time - he's charismatic, funny and just a blast to see on screen. Also, the film is just so funny. So many iconic lines (And when everyone's super no one will be) (Where is my supersuit?), (Edna Mode in general) and so many great jokes (Coincidence? I think NOT!), and it makes the film ridiculously fun from start to finish. It's hard to choose a favourite element, but I think I'll go for the fact that every main character has a well developed arc, with Bob learning to reconnect with his family, particularly Helen, and Helen becoming a more motherly figure over her kids. Violet becomes more confident and Dash becomes more mature and appreciates his family more by the end of the film.",_

But with Pixar's new title, we once more experience a great gratifying animation which deeps you inside by it's humorous and enthralling plot and keeps you laughing out loudly until the very end. Dreamworks' titles compared to Pixars are not too peculiar, but they seem to rip all their titles from Pixar and create a fake illusion of originality.

It wasn't till I started writing this that I picked up on the reference to one of TV's first talk show hosts, Jack Paar. That would have been the littlest member of The Incredibles Family, Jack-Jack Parr. Spelled different but it's still a cool in joke. I'm more of a super-hero movie fan than I am of animated flicks, but it was a pretty good idea to combine the two genres here for a fun and entertaining movie.

Nelson is wonderful and recognizable as the voice of the father and superhero who can't give up his former profession. His wife is the voice of norm here who wants a normal life for their family. I could see why this film and others have attracted audiences whether young and old, parents, grandparents, and children. Most audiences can relate to the situation and enjoy the Disney film and appreciate how technology has come along way.",

48,10 June 2007,planktonrules,9, Exceptional fare for the entire family,"While I wasn't quite as fond of this C.G. film as I was of TOY STORY II , it was one of the better computer generated films I've seen. Much of this is because like all the better movies of this type, it is marketed and designed for both kids and adults. My brother and his wife have no kids and yet they called me to plead with me to see the film after they'd seen it--and that is why this is such an appealing film. The animation is lovely, the characters pretty exciting and interesting and the story is pretty good as well. Oddly, however, what I remember most was NOT the movie but one of the extras on the DVD called ""Jack-Jack Attack"". For those of you who have not seen the DVD or only watched the feature film, please go back NOW and see this extra as it greatly enhanced the film and provided a nice infusion of humor that the movie sometimes needed. Overall, a terrific film and well worth your time.",

54,17 July 2014,poe426,10, Fantastic Foursome...,"It's hard to believe that it's been a decade since I saw this one... The trailer that showed the long-retired Mr. Incredible trying to fit into his old costume was what hooked me; I'd written a story for the American Zoetrope website about a decade before that dealt with the exact same thing- only without the humor. Being a lifelong comic book fan (whenever money permitted), I recognized The Fantastic Four the moment I saw them (although, to be fair, Mr. Fantastic was actually preceded in comics by Jack Cole's Plastic Man and The Human Torch before he became Human was an android capable of setting himself alight). The opening scenes establish that THE INCREDIBLES Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl were just two among MANY Supers who roamed the land before a lawsuit brought them all down (a lawsuit, we learn, that was the result of fanboy ""Incrediboy"" interfering in Mr. Incredible's attempt to stop the dastardly Bomb Voyage from blowing up a building)- and all of this en route to Mr. Incredible's wedding to Elastigirl... The disenfranchised Supers shoe-horn themselves into ""normal"" society, but each and every one of them is chomping at the bit to get back into costume. Meanwhile, the evil Syndrome is making plans to destroy Mr. Incredible. Will he succeed? Next issue: The Shocking Answer!!!",
55,9 March 2018,TheMovieDiorama,10, The Incredibles is the pinnacle of superhero animation.,"Not to mention this is my favourite Pixar animation, this is also my favourite superhero film. A genre that is ridiculously exhausted now, The Incredibles took superheroes and made them relatable, human...and damn likeable. They are just like us, with families and a desire to do good in the world. Sure they have powers that neither me, you or the pet cat have, but it was refreshing to watch the day-to-day lives of a super heroic family. The family we follow is the Parr family, in particular the focus is on Mr Incredible. Washed up, old and trying to earn a living, he desires to be the famed superhero that he once was. Where to begin with this? Outstanding animation, perfect voice casting, memorable characters, inventive plot and one of the most quotable scripts of all time. There is no way anyone can hate on this film, no way. Every character is superb, from the charming Parr family to the villainous Syndrome (who by the way, is your biggest fan...). But the champion is the one, the only...Edna Mode. Every scene with her, is comedic genius. Where her spinoff film? I would pay top dollar to see that! The script is phenomenally quotable and plagued with famous scenes. ""Where's my super suit!?"", ""No capes!!"", ""Go home buddy, I work alone."" and a personal favourite ""Coincidence? I think NOT!"". Consistently funny, witty and charming, you don't get scripts like these in every family film. The plot was engrossing with no pointless scenes, the pacing was rapid and builds up to the final battle sequence. The superpowers were creative, heck even the baby has some damn awesome superpowers. A baby!? When was the last time you saw that in a film? Oh and Samuel L Jackson was perfect voice casting for Frozone, without a doubt. In my opinion, drum roll please, Pixar haven't exceeded with an animation since The Incredibles. This being one of my favourite films of all time, this is a super duper ridiculously easy perfect rating. Where's my sequel? I need it now.",

This movie is very cool! Many years ago,Bob Parr and Helen Parr were famous heroes that helped to save their nation, being known as ''Mr. Incredible'' and ''Elastigirl''.And they were not the only ones: many other heroes also worked with them, one of them 'Frozone'(normal name: Lucius Best) Mr. Incredible's best friend. But the time was passing, and things were changing: many people were unhappy with the heroes, seeing their efforts to help as a threat instead of a good thing. Soon the government asked the heroes to retire their 'uniforms'and act like regular citizens. That's the main base about 'The Incredibles', showing the life of Bob, Helen Parr and their kids trying to fit as 'regular people', trying to avoid their powers.

In fact, of all the movies I saw last year the only one I rank ahead of it is another super hero movie ""Spider-man 2"". Of course, I enjoy super hero flicks so they had that going for them. This movie centers around a super hero forced to live an ordinary life after certain problems arise during a rescue of a person falling from a building and a train accident. The super hero (Mr. Incredible) isn't adjusting to life as an ordinary guy to well. He keeps helping those in need even at the risk of losing money for his company. I found this trait most endearing, because it showed he was not in the biz merely for the glory, but that he truly wants to help people. So much so that he goes out one night a week with his old super hero buddy ""Frozone"" and they stop some crimes. However, when Mr. Incredible gets an invitation to go to an island and do his super hero thing he leaps at the opportunity. Eventually, this leads to his capture and the rest of the family must come to the rescue. Every aspect of this film was great, I loved that this film was actually rather long as it is one of the rare animated movies that really has a chance to develop a good story. You aren't going to be to surprised by many things, but here you just do not need to be surprised. The voices are all great headlined terrifically by Craig T Nelson and Holly Hunter. Good laughs, good action, and an all around good movie are awaiting you in this little treasure. I especially liked Dash's sprint through the forest. If I had any complaints it might be that I wish Samuel L Jackson's character Frozone was in it a bit more.",

From the very start of the film, the viewer is all ready to submerge into a film that takes animation and ""children's entertainment"" to a whole new level, and this level isn't just pretentious gibber concocted to look revolutionary. This is the real thing. And it's almost a superb film. But I must take strong, even drastic conflict with the underlying themes that the film presents. What makes the ""The Incredibles"" both excellent and reprehensible is Bird's writing that unfortunately overlooks and neglects aspects in it's presentation. At least I hope so. The film leaps back and forth from a respectable animated film into something dark and ugly, and, amongst such, paints a gloss over it and claims accessibility to children. It is such a fact that I pray is never repeated. ",

The Incredibles works principally because it strikes a fine balance between the fun kids movie that it's facade suggests it is, and a movie of substance. That's why Pixar's animations work; there's something for everyone. Younger audiences will enjoy the high paced action and quick one-liners, while older audiences can delight in the themes of loss, family and doing what you're good at; while having a blast at the same time. The Incredibles is based on an absurdly funny idea, which sees superhero couple Mr Incredible and Elastigirl, along with the rest of the superhero world, having to take regular jobs after a series of law-suits are filed against superhero's after a number of their saves went wrong.

Basically Bob Parr aka Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) with his super human strength and his wife Helen aka Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) with her super flexibility, with the help of their friend Lucius Best aka Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) with his super cool ice power, are the greatest superheroes of Metorville saving lives and battling evil with the powers every day. But after causing expenses damages and with many lawsuits, fifteen years later they have forced to retire and live as ""normal"" people in the suburbs, with their identities protected by the government. Bob and Helen during this time have made a family of three super children, with young super fast Dashiell 'Dash' (Spencer Fox), teenage invisibility powered and forcefield making Violet (Sarah Vowell), and baby Jack Jack. Bob is itching to get into the superhero business again, especially after being fired from his ""normal"" job, and he leaps at the opportunity to get it back on the mysterious Nomanisan Island, being given a new suit and some practise. Then he meets the one who made it all possible, and his new arch nemesis who will soon want to take over the city, Syndrome (My Name Is Earl's Jason Lee), formally his biggest fan Buddy, now gone bad. Soon Helen realises what Bob is up to, and with the help of Edna E. Mode (Brad Bird) she, and the two capable kids don the new costumes to go and save him, and then the city. Also starring Wallace Shawn as Gilbert Huph and Pixar regular John Ratzenberger as the Underminer. The animation is impressive, there are plenty of funny moments, the actors voicing are all good, and the action sequences are well timed, a very satisfying animated comedy adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Sound Editing and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and was nominated for Best Sound Mixing and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it won the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.

96,22 December 2004,valadas,6, No progress,"In my opinion this movie represents no progress in the history of modern animation movies in which computer technique replaced drawing technique. This story could be made and told with real actors instead of animated characters. In fact we don't see here any anthropomorphic animals, fairies or witches just only normal people living in a city of the present times though some of them endowed with supernatural powers whose origin is never revealed. No poetry or lyricism either just only adventure and violent fighting with the usual common special effects computers can produce even in movies performed by real players. But even these effects are not especially creative or more original than those we have seen in a lot of other recent animation movies. Do the people who made this movie think that animated characters can portray human emotions or feelings than human actors whatever the former's facial expressions and bodily movements may look human? When they are well done we like them just because they seem human and not because they are better expressed then by real actors and actresses. Of course the only advantage is that animated characters can be 100% shaped by his creator in a way that no movie director can make with human players who always have their own personalities. But this is precisely what we like to see: a human player putting in the acting something of his or her own personality and not acting like a created robot. Well for those who like this kind of movie they won't be disappointed after all since the movie has got enough action and enough thrilling scenes to make it fairly enjoyable.",

You have a family that all have super powers, you have a villain and a secret island somewhere in the world. How can you go wrong with this? Clearly you can't cause this movie, because although it is 115 minutes long, it is still entertaining and I didn't feel like I was watching a two hour movie. There are comic references to both the young audience and for the adult audience and it is mixed beautifully. As far as I know, this is the first time that there has been an animated movie about a family that are human. So that is pretty interesting. The other thing that really caught my attention was how they did the hair for the young daughter. It looked really lifelike. So will you enjoy this movie?

106,10 July 2006,Robert_duder,10, Possibly one of the greatest feats of Animation ever...revolutionary!!,"I finally got around to seeing The Incredibles which was exactly that!! Pixar has already struck gold long before The Incredibles came along but they continue to revolutionize animation making it a whole new genre that rakes in the cash and for good reason. Pixar and other recent animated features have managed to create films that kids adore but adults also love seeing and The Incredibles is the pinnacle of that conglomeration. The Incredibles storyline could have been a live action film that adults would have loved, the story, script and premise were as live action and real as it gets but instead it was animated in brilliant CGI that is stunning at times. I have to immediately point out how amazing t he water and fire effects were and I don't even have a high definition television and I was amazed by that effect alone. The story unfolds at a very nice pace without rushing to the action or funny scenes and never tries to hurry through anything. We are introduced to Bob, and Helen in their younger Heroic days and then we see them fifteen years later as the regular every day citizens trying to deal with the fact that they have super powers that they can't use to help people anymore.",

117,19 November 2020,SebMoz,10, Definietly the best Pixar movie,"Brad Bird is most definietly the best director Pixar has utilized in their entire history, at least in my opinion. Even though he's only made 3 movies so far, they all have this feeling attached to them that no other Pixar movies do. That is the feeling of maturity, Bird writes and directs his movies as if they were made for adults, and children were more of an after-thought. Nowhere is this clearer than in The Incredibles. The plotline draws you in very easily, and the pacing is extremely good. The dialogue in this movie feels very mature and sophisticated, and Bob and Helens relationsship is portrayed almost uncomfortably realistic, to the point that I didn't catch most of the subtleties as a kid. And that's the biggest strength of the movie, the characters. Each of the family members is portrayed so wonderfully realistic, their struggles feel real and their arguments don't feel obnoxious. The other characters are great as well. Frozone and Edna are both great, and Syndrome is a fantastic villain. He's pathetic and funny yet a genuine threat at the same time. The performances of course help bringing the characters to life, with basically everyone doing a great job with their voice acting. Another thing this movie does very good is the dark undertones. There are a lot of deaths and heartbreak, both to a degree you wouldn't see in a regular Pixar movie. The movie also has excellent score and sound design, and the action scenes are (for a lack of a better word) Incredible. The continuity within the film is great, the characters are fantastic and the visuals are gorgeous. This is one of my all time favorite movies, it's definietly the best Pixar movie and maybe even the best movie released by a Disney-owned company. I highly recommend this to anyone that appreciates deep, meaningful story-telling, and I have no problem giving it the highest score I can.",

Even the music is funny. When Mr. Incredible is creeping around the island fortress of the evil Sundrome the music is strikingly suggestive of the kind of tense themes John Barry would write for James Bond's infiltration of the island fortress in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and many others.

130,15 February 2020,Ryan_Barbakins,10, Fantastically Witty Family Superhero Flm!,"The Incredibles presents a family with superpowers that must deal with living in a world where using super powers is illegal. Pixar yet again presents a fun, clever, and original idea to the big the screen for all ages to enjoy. And the execution of this concept is absolutly stellar! Brad Bird's pixar films truly are not made for children, they are made to satisfy adults while still making it something that kids can enjoy.
All four of the characters go through a self-changing arc that turns them into better people by the end of the film. Mr. Incredible learns that his family is more important than his desires, Elastigirl learns that her husband cares more about his family than she is willing to admit, Violet learns that opening up and embracing yourself is better than hiding in the shadows, and dash learns that slowing down every once in a while isn't the end of the world. All of this helps strengthen not only the characters, but also their relationships to one another.
Syndrome is one of the greatest cinematic villains in history. His character and plan is so logical and clever that is has been replicated multiple times in other superhero films (including twice in the MCU).
The film never seems to skip a beat. When our heros are not fighting crime, they are fighting at the dinner table with each other. Every scene has a purpose whether it is for the advancement of the plot or developing the family.

136,30 March 2005,BaronBl00d,8, That's Incredible...Sure It Must Have Been Used...But I'm Feeling Lazy!,"What could I possibly add to any discussion of The Incredibles? Its popularity is worldwide, and its critical success sewed up with an Oscar. It is an incredible movie in many ways. It has some crazy, innovative animation that will leave your jaw dropping at times. It has some humorous looks at humanity that few films explore. It is in every sense a family film when so many pretend to be just that. But is it THAT incredible? Don't get me wrong. I loved the film. I thought how clever this was and all that, but I wasn't bowled over like I had been when I saw Finding Nemo...or Shrek...or even Shrek 2 or Shark Tale. It must be me. I thought the film was very good...even excellent...but not the best. The story was just not strong enough for me nor were the characters as to give them that kind of attention. The family members...and I am not going to give a general overview of plot when so many have done so...were interesting characters but when separated had little of the specialness of other animated characters when standing alone. I guess if you wanted Dora in Nemo or the Donkey in Shrek to do a film as the focal characters - they might be able to carry a film on their narrow shoulders (or fins) if possible. Would any of these characters be able to do that? Let's face it the most interesting character was the crazy, short costume designer(an obvious and funny homage to the late, great Edith Head). I thought the villain in particular was very weak. I'm not panning the film. It is a great animated film and is very funny and so on. I just don't know if it has earned all the praise lavished on it. Anyway, I want to recommend this film as a fun film and definitely as a fun FAMILY film. Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunetr, especially Samuel Jackson as Frozone, and all the rest do a great job suiting their voices to characters and breathing life into this animated classic. (Yes, I did like the film.)",

The problem comes when the movie switches from being something that questioned the genre and made it more real to something that no longer takes its characters seriously. By the end this is just a ride movie, not an action movie with consistent character development and a point that people could walk away with. now, i'm not talking about a sound-byte ""Message"" that was missing, because something like that actually was there, it was just betrayed by the ending. The family of the incredibles became people with extraordinary powers rather than truly special or extraordinary people. *Spoiler* The lack of responsibility towards the villain that Mr. ""incredible"" showed disproves that he is anything other than a man with superhuman strength. He is not a hero. His ego had a part in creating the villain. syndrome had free will and choice to do what he did and it couldn't be called Mr incredible's fault, but Mr. incredible does kill him in a very cavalier manner with no attempt to capture or rehabilitate him, as a hero, incredible is supposed to be better in character than regular people. The film also treated the killing of syndrome as a joke, with that cape thing. on the one hand something like that can be considered funny in a cartoonish comic book setting but not in a world that is supposed to be taken seriously as the world of the incredibles had been set up to be.

I was actually more bored than entertained. The 3D animation was pretty good when it came out, it's developed by Pixar after all. But besides the good animation when this movie came out, that just seems like it's all that is going for this movie. It's not a bad movie, it's actually worth a watch in my opinion.

Aside from our family of superheroes, there's fashion diva Edna Mode, ""oh-so-cool"" Frozone, and obnoxious boss Gilbert Huph (perfectly voiced by Wallace Shawn). Even the smallest of characters stand out (such as Bomb Voyage). Pixar made a great investment in hiring Brad Bird. He's a very talented man who has created a popcorn masterpiece.",

Lauded by critics and audiences on release, presumably for being yet another feature animated film to have come out of the American stable of CGI infused pieces, the likes of which for some reason everyone feels the need to jump to both the defence and lauding of as quickly as possible, The Incredibles leaves a lot to be desired as it weaves its way down a plodding road to an uninspired finale of crashing; hitting and farce. Where Brad Bird's previous film, 1999's The Iron Giant was sombre; sweet and mature in its observing of a friendship between boy and machine, The Incredibles is loud; in-your-face; obnoxious and a gross muddle of cross-contaminated child and adult orientated material which does not work.

At first just by looking at a poster I did not think it would be a great movie. The picture of the super-hero family made me think that the movie would be more enjoyed by younger children, but you cannot judge movies and books by their cover.

Expect the same masterful Pixar animation, rendering, and character design. Plot wise this is a twist on your basic comic book super hero. In this case we have a family of super heroes living in a world that no longer appreciates them. Think super heroes meet mid life crisis and you have the basic idea. Much of the film obviously borrows heavily from the James Bond genre from the music to the over the top villain and his evil super villain lair. One half expects to see Dr. Evil pop up somewhere. The writers have done a good job crafting a believable and charming family that you will actually care for, good dialogue goes a long ways here. They have also done a good job of finding creative and comical ways of using each characters super powers both individually and in tandem as a family super hero team.",

165,29 December 2020,CubsandCulture,5, Time has not been kind to this film,"When I saw this for the first time back in 2004 I thought it was a good film with a couple of big issues. Shockingly the first is the overall design of the film is poor. The characters, locales were clearly influenced by Golden age superhero comics-Marvels' Fantastic Four being the most obvious-and the mid 60's ABC action cartoons-i.e. Birdman, Johnny Quest. Those works are 2D, cell animation and the designs are structured for that form. This film never fully adjusted the designs to 3d computer animation and it makes everything slightly off. You can clearly see this in the credits as that 2d animation works better than most of the film. Second, the film's conceptualization of superheroes is dangerously close to the ubermensch for the tykes. Bird's script is sloppy-repeatedly-with the sociological implications of his characters; the script plays out like Watchmen (the comic) filtered through Disney with the critique cut out. I cringe hard when Helen tells Violet ""it's in your blood.""",

169,12 August 2005,ryan_kuhn,8," ""You know I'm retired from hero work.""","Oh how far we've come. Remember back in the 1980s when a computer generated cartoon character of a guy in sunglasses looked so ridiculous that some thought computers had no future. After the success of the Shrek movies and Finding Nemo in the early 2000s, the computer revolution reached a crescendo with Disney/Pixar Studio's movie The Incredibles. The richness and scope of the scenes in The Incredibles is what makes the movie so watchable. The story is pretty good too, a solid superhero story that appeals to both kids and adults, with a sly sense of humor that will entertain. The use of a newsreel montage takes older viewers back to the a day when all of the news came in grainy newsreel stories that had their distinctive narrators. But the punchline comes with the real modern concern presented in the newsreel: citizens suing anyone and everyone. The Incredibles tells the story of Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and how they cope with life after superheroes were ""retired"" by the government over growing legal concerns. The couple have three children, two of which have special powers of their own. Mr. Incredible takes on the name Bob Parr, with wife Helen, and kids Dash (Spencer Fox), Violet (Sarah Vowell) and baby Jack Jack, as they live a normal, boring life where they can't exhibit their powers. When Bob is given a chance to return to his suit, he takes it, working for someone named ""Mirage"" (Elizabeth Peña) who ends up working for the dastardly Syndrome (Jason Lee), who was once a huge Mr. Incredible fan. Mr. Incredible gets into big time trouble, and it's up to his family to save the day. The family becomes liberated at the notion that they can partake in their magic powers, and the energy of the movie really picks up. This leads to some standard chase scenes, but they look great due to the wonderful computer animation techniques used by the film makers. The richness of the colors and details on the screen pack the punch needed to make the silly movie believable. Samuel L. Jackson also plays a superhero, Frozone, who is mainly a background character. At nearly 2 hours long, The Incredibles is lengthy, though never tedious, and is the longest completely computer generated movie to date.",

172,27 November 2004,ferguson-6,8," Totally Wicked, Pixar","Greetings again from the darkness. OK, so I felt a little foolish walking into an animated feature without any kids. However, the embarrassment turned into fascination as soon as the short, ""Boundin'"" started. Nice little parable to start the day. ""The Incredibles"" is the latest offering from Pixar (and the director of ""The Iron Giant"") and is bit like ""Toy Story"" on steroids. Everyone from age 5 and up will enjoy this and some will be shocked at the realism, action sequences and drama of the story. Craig T. Nelson (TV's ""Coach"" and the ""Poltergeist"" dad) and Holly Hunter (""Thirteen"" and ""The Piano"") are the lead voices as Mr. Incredible and his wife, ElastiGirl. They are Superheroes forced into hiding and feeble attempts at normalcy with their kids, who were of course also blessed with superhero traits. The action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking and the mix of parental struggles, teen angst, sibling rivalry and hero worship make for a story strong enough to keep one's interest for 2 hours. Pixar continues to flirt with reality in their animation and we get the feeling that at anytime they will trick us with the blurred line between reality and fantasy. Samuel L Jackson and Jason Lee turn in nice voice acting, but little Dash pretty much steals every scene he is in. So, hold your head up high and go see this one. You don't even have to borrow any nieces or nephews!! Also, make sure to stay for the closing credits - they are a delight with the visuals and the score, which blends James Bond, The Avengers, The Pink Panther and Looney Toons all into one sound!",

Jackson, Jason Lee, Wallace Shawn: Computer generated fun fest about massive strength and normality. The Incredibles are a family of superheroes under the witness protection program trying to start a new life in the suburbs. Problem is that Mr. Incredible misses the action and saving lives. When he loses his job he is suddenly presented with the opportunity to help people again. What he doesn't realize is that a trap is set by an old enemy to expose them and reveal their power source. Great setup burdened with formula storytelling and a third act that is overrun with too many climaxes. Director Brad Bird delivers the same brand of humour that worked for him in The Iron Giant. Craig T. Nelson voices Mr. Incredible who doesn't know his own strength. Holly Hunter voices Elasta-girl who can stretch beyond normal measures. Samuel L. Jackson voices a sidekick who has ice powers. Jason Lee voices the villain who desired to be a superhero himself until constant rejection rendered him a villain. Wallace Shawn voices the small but overbearing supervisor that meets consequences when he pushes his authority too far. Beautifully animated comedy about talent and serving but it also makes a case for normality and how we as a society hold various talents to contribute to the good of others. Score: 8 / 10",

The start of the movie is certainly fun, but it mocks a world recognise more in the 'polical correctness gone mad' stereotypes than the one I actually see around me. The message is thankfully tempered by the tendency of said heroes to actually cause disasters only marginally less severe than the ones they are saving people from, and the end of the film becomes more of a straightforward action movie, thankfully less solemn than the likes of Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' films but scarcely more absurd than a typical James Bond.

The characters are never more than run-of-the-mill stereotypes, with the screenplay never rising really above the ordinary, except for a full good jokes. Still, it is all quite watchable, and some of the non-action sequences, such as the driving on roads and newspaper footage, had me very impressed. It is a visual marvel - and the Oscar winning sound effects are good too. But is it anything more? Well, I guess that is up to the individual to decide.",

After the silly, family-friendly Fantastic Four we got back in 2005 and its only-slightly-better sequel in 2006, Josh Trank's much-anticipated 2015 reboot failed spectacularly, causing Fox to shelve the tainted franchise indefinitely. Since Kevin Feige and the MCU can seemingly do no wrong, we will finally be getting an interpretation worthy of Marvel's first family. What most fans didn't realise however, is that we already had a great Fantastic Four movie, only it wasn't made by Marvel and didn't feature the likes of Mr. Fantastic and the Human Torch.

And what works would these be? Now, for comic book readers, this identification is immediate and the two direct references that can be made are with Watchmen, Alan Moore's seminal graphic novel, from 1986, and with the stories of the Fantastic Four, a group created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, in 1961.",

Thankfully, writer/director Brad Bird has taken his years of creativity (as a longtime contributor to ""The Simpsons"") and poured every drop into one of the best computer-animated films I've ever seen--while the title may sound pompous and hyperbolic, ""The Incredibles"" delivers high-quality thrills and laughs on an epic scale. Part of the fun lies in Bird's own lampooning of superhero clichés while developing a narrative that draws a very valid conclusion about the dangers of fanboy-love. The Incredibles themselves are a family defined by their super-powers: Bob Paar (aka Mr. Incredible, a Superman surrogate, voiced by Craig T. Nelson), his wife, Helen (aka Elastigirl; Holly Hunter), daughter Violet (able to turn herself invisible and put up force-fields), and sons Dash (named thus for his ability to run super-fast) and Jack-Jack (whose hidden talent is saved for the very end); when obsessive fan Buddy Pine (Jason Lee) takes his own superhero-fascination to extreme lengths, it is up to the quirky family (called out of exile after being blacklisted) to put a stop to his plans. The voice-actors fully inhabit their animated counterparts, nailing the human imperfections and weaknesses that eventually equate ""saving the fam"" as an act just as important as Saving the World. While I had considerably less love for Bird's ""Ratatouille,"" ""The Incredibles"" is still a beacon of promise for an extensive animation career to come.",

Sharks undergoing therapy for cannibalism, or an ant committing suicide by walking into a drop of water, are creative re-workings of what we see and dismiss everyday.

The Incredibles does have a nice twist working for it: what if, like some demented Alan Moore comic, the supers were no longer welcome to do their job and had to settle for being normal people? How would they respond to that? That's the basic gist of The Incredibles, and we focus mostly on Mr. Incredible, aka Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson), who is definitely having trouble fitting in.

While there were elements throughout the film that I felt children would enjoy, I did feel as if 92% of this film was invested with the intelligent adult in mind.

271,30 March 2018,elicopperman,9, One of My Favorite Superhero Movies,"After nearly fifteen years, this movie is still one of Pixar's most outstanding works (in my opinion at least). With numerous superhero films coming out in the 21st century, The Incredibles has stood as one of the most unique superhero movies in history, mainly for how it focuses on a family of superheroes (a real family btw, not a figurative one like Fantastic Four). I personally can't even count the amount of times I've watched this movie I love it so much, but let's see why.",
272,24 September 2018,Hollywood_Yoda,10, Great Pixar Achievement,"Hard to believe that this film will be hitting it's 15th anniversary next year!

273,20 December 2004,Craig-9,10," Excellent Movie, Not Just For Kids","I can't believe a movie this good would rack up so many negative comments. I took my 8-year-old nephew and 7-year-old niece, knowing they both really wanted to see it, but dreading a ""kiddie"" flick. What a wonderful surprise! As others have said, this is easily one of the best movies, period, that I've seen all year, not just the best animated film. The story and the writing really appeal to an adult sensibility, especially a well-read comic geek such as myself, while the action sequences are plentiful and appeal to the younger crowd. If anything, there may be a bit too much of the family/work life scenes for younger kids--the movie is rather slow for long stretches. But I don't count that as a negative. The insights and the message which comes through is amazingly subversive--beware of a world in which there is nothing special, where mediocrity is celebrated. You don't expect that from a Disney film. The whole domestic take on superheroes and their secret identities could have come direct from an issue of Brian Michael Bendis' Powers or Alias, though not taken to those extremes. More importantly, not only did I have a great time at the film, my niece and nephew did, too. We're all looking forward to the sequel.",

It's a simple, familiar and easily conceivable good guy vs. bad guy routine and the basic plot becomes apparent very early into the film. This despite the fact that the actual bad guy is not exposed an until about an hour into the film. Now this set-up might work for 6-10 year old's, but it certainly doesn't work for the average adult watching this film. Despite falling into the latter category myself (being 23 years young) I neither found this simple core story annoying nor did I feel that it took anything away from the fun that became and is The Incredibles. Fact is, that the the great characters, the familiar situations, the great visuals and music all add up to make the simple set-up fade away into oblivion.",

Then, people haven't forgotten their first take on the superhero genre known as ""The Incredibles"", a story about a family living in a quiet suburban life who are being forced into action to save the world from an evil force. As a child, I loved it and after 10 years, it's still incredible. Back then I never realized how mature and action packed this film is it's one of Pixar's best since Toy Story and Finding Nemo. There's absolutely no flaws with this film.",
282,15 March 2021,christypddunne,9, Surprisingly unique superhero movie,"And I use ''Superhero'' loosely because this film goes for a more James Bond, spy kind of tone, and it fits really well! It also leads to a pretty explicit animated film with the amount of innuendos, death and darkness found here. The characters here have great chemistry (when they're not fighting or yelling), and Syndrome is by far the best villain in Pixar history! It loses points for the animation. This movie... doesn't look that great. It looks fine, don't get me wrong, but everything just looks kinda bland and plastic-ish, especially compared to other Pixar movies like Monsters Inc. or Toy Story 2.

Basically it follows forcefully retired superheroes who must come out of retirement to save the world yet again and in the process learning about each other as a family. The humor and dialogue is spot on throughout the film, the story is very strong, and the CGI animation is top-notch. On top of that, the performances by the stars (most notably Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Samuel L. Jackson) are perfect and kudos to composer Michael Giacchino for his homage score to John Barry's James Bond scores. The music was a real treat to those who long for Barry to tackle another James Bond film. All in all, The Incredibles is incredible, a must see at 9 out of 10.",
285,17 May 2005,FilmOtaku,6, It's got something for everyone,"Generally not being a fan of Pixar animation (or most American animated films for that matter) I admit that while I watched ""The Incredibles"" with some trepidation, I was optimistic because of a couple of factors: First of all, I'm a comic book/super hero geek from way back and will see most of the films that fall into this genre. (I even endured the horrid ""Hellboy"" because of this ugly fascination) Secondly, Sarah Vowell voices the character of the Violet, the daughter, and pretty much anything that Vowell touches turns to darkly humored intellectual gold. And finally, the writer and director was Brad Bird, one of the original guys behind ""The Simpsons"", one of the greatest television shows of all time. So I asked myself, what could possibly go wrong? Thankfully, not a whole lot. From the action-packed beginning of the film where we are introduced to the majority of the characters, it is clear that this is going to be film that is going to appeal primarily to adults, with enough sight gags and silliness to keep the kids entertained throughout. Chronicling the lives of a family of superheroes, ""The Incredibles"" manages to create a plausible family story (though the family is certainly different from most). After a series of perceived screw ups, the government has cracked down on super heroes and have placed them into the witness protection program. Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible (Nelson) is now an overweight claims processor for an insurance company who is unsatisfied with his humdrum life and longs to relive his former glory. Helen Parr/Elastigirl (Hunter) is his wife, and seems to have adjusted to her suburban life nicely and enjoys taking care of the home and being a mother to her children Dash, Violet and baby Jack Jack. Sometimes at night, however, Bob has been sneaking out with his friend Lucius Best/Frozone (Jackson) to listen to police scanners and, when a crime or emergency occurs, answer the call of duty before anyone else arrives. When Bob receives a mysterious package from someone asking him to become a ""contract super hero"" and do various tasks for them, he jumps at the chance, a decision that puts himself, his family, and the world in peril.",

The animation is done pretty well, and the story combines plenty of action and comedy. It is a pretty enjoyable film, but the main problem that I had with this film was the ending. (You can count on a sequel coming in a few years.) In fact, there are a couple of endings, and the last ending seems to leave you hanging, almost literally. It looks as if they wanted to wrap it all up but could not decide which ending to use, and they also wanted to make a sequel.

I am a big Disney fan but this particular animated feature disappointed me at every department. I) The plot is very simple, predictable and, thus, completely unexcited. II) No humor. I mean it. I did not laugh, even once (OK it is very personal remark since senses of humor differ, you might have found it to be hysterically funny) III) The characters are primitive, not captivating.. I found nothing interesting about Bob, Helen and their kids. IV) Yes, lots and lots of special effects. But there is nothing behind them. The producers seem to have forgotten it is the characters, the story that can make people love the movie, not pyrotechnics. The fact that this film became one of the season's biggest grosser can be explained by it having been made for and seen by elementary school kids.",
292,15 November 2014,ofpsmith,9," ""No capes!""","The Incredibles is a good well though out film. Being this is the first Pixar movie with human beings as the main characters they did really well on the animation. This is the story. In the early 1960s (probably) in a city in the United States we see Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible (Craig T Nelson) as a superhero who is treated as a regular celebrity. Bob's superpower is that he has super strong abilities. There are a bunch of other super heroes including Helen Parr (Holly Hunter) his fiancée who can morph into anything, and Lucius Best (Samuel L Jackson) who can freeze anything. Everything is going fine until Bob is sued and eventually all super heroes are forced into a normal life. Fast forward to 15 years later where we see Bob living his normal life with Helen and their kids Dash (Spencer Fox) and Violet (Sarah Vowell). Bob is a bored insurance claims investor and constantly angers his boss. He looks for excitement and is recruited by a former fan of Bob's named Buddy Pine (Jason Lee) who is secretly planning to eliminate him. The rest I won't explain. The story is really good and the animation is really good. This is the first Pixar feature film with humans as the main characters. When you look at their old short films like Tin Toy you see that Pixar never really had much success with animating humans. But when they made this, the animation was great and they got it spot on. It's a really good movie and I definitely recommend it.",

What made this animated film so great was not just the graphics but the characters and the storyline. It is a typical action/adventure film, but it is animated. The various abilities of the heroes were fantastic, the humor was unstoppable, including some inaapropiate as I say ""fat jokes"", and brief sexual dialogue. But I love this family film, understanding the PG rating though. This movie is better than Nemo, Ice Age, and Monster Inc., but the two Shrek films in my opinion remain the best. this is a great family movie, filled with action, humor, and amazing animation!",

Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Samuel L. Jackson provide great voice work, and and some of the flick's funnier moments. I was also pleasantly surprised that the action scenes were entertaining, including a battle with a robot that was much better than the crappy idiotic fights from Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.

Some of the scenes like Mrs. Incredibles encounter with the bad guys or the kids fighting them is so mesmerizing that you can't resist but say ' WOW!'. Only thing I didn't like that is the odd reason given by the bad character to rule over the world so that hen he dies, he would give his machines to others and then all would perish.

300,2 December 2004,dnlgg,8," Smart, Funny, but inconsistent tone and morality","This is a very enjoyable movie, with a lot of smart and interesting twists to the superhero genre. however it feels like two separate movies. The first half is more serious and is like a cross between a superhero spoof and the idea of a superhero taken as reality. The problem comes when the movie switches from being something that questioned the genre and made it more real to something that no longer takes its characters seriously. By the end this is just a ride movie, not an action movie with consistent character development and a point that people could walk away with. now, i'm not talking about a sound-byte ""Message"" that was missing, because something like that actually was there, it was just betrayed by the ending. The family of the incredibles became people with extraordinary powers rather than truly special or extraordinary people. *Spoiler* The lack of responsibility towards the villain that Mr. ""incredible"" showed disproves that he is anything other than a man with superhuman strength. He is not a hero. His ego had a part in creating the villain. syndrome had free will and choice to do what he did and it couldn't be called Mr incredible's fault, but Mr. incredible does kill him in a very cavalier manner with no attempt to capture or rehabilitate him, as a hero, incredible is supposed to be better in character than regular people. The film also treated the killing of syndrome as a joke, with that cape thing. on the one hand something like that can be considered funny in a cartoonish comic book setting but not in a world that is supposed to be taken seriously as the world of the incredibles had been set up to be. This movie had great potential and is still excellent in many respects, but it is not the great film that many critics and audiences seem to think it is.",

But now I see that there's an inverse. Nemo's opening short was the hilarious ""Knick Knack,"" and the movie just turned out to be mediocre. Here, ""Boundin'"" was quite atrocious, but The Incredibles was great. How could I tell it was great from the beginning?

It is a scintillatingly gifted production, but as so often, being American, it wants to supply more than just enough, so it's a wee bit long, and a wee bit convoluted. But these are only quibbles: it's hard to imagine anything more compelling for the juvenile mind --- except experiencing it in three dimensions.

Adult oriented animation is growing mainstream. This animation feels more like a regular film in that respect. We now take for granted the spectacular animation, so we pay attention to the story and characters. The story is not the most original - some have brought up the similarity to ""Spy Kids"" and I will concur. The very thing you will notice is much less humour. Once again this is not a bad thing, because we are given a more fleshed out relationship between the father and mother. Also, one of the kids definitely is a rebel, a nice touch to show that there no longer is such a thing as a nuclear family in this day and age. ",

His parts were alway funny to me. It was clever for Dash to get away with his teacher with his secret super powers. The best quote from the movie was, "" coincidence? I think not?!""

Fortunately, there's still the chance of seeing it in the theaters as of this writing. For me, this wasn't the only reason to see it though.

It gives messages about being different and making the most of stuff without being too pretentious. It's very relatable that way. That's not to say this movie isn't fun; it is fun and it's one of the best Pixar films since Toy Story. I wasn't much on Cars (and never saw the sequels) but this is cool.

Pixar created characters that will clearly be very memorable and may continue to survive long after the film finishes its run. Holly Hunter was great along with all her co stars. The concept seems to be a mix of the Bond movies and a touch of True Lies. The characters have been clearly immersed in reality, even named after the stereotype mother that is in reality expected to be made of stretch material to maintain the obligations and demands of her family. The relationships of the all the characters are in so many ways very familiar with a brilliant creative edge to sustain the freshness. Well executed from every angle.

""The Incredibles"", is predictably about a family of retired superheroes and how coming back to the business affects the family, which has powers like no other than includes strength, speed, flexibility, and forcefield shifting. I thought the movie was pretty interesting, and Pixar finally made a movie with action, peril, and romance. There's no other Pixar movie like this. I enjoyed most of the characters in this movie that were portrayed by Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, and even the film's own director portraying the best role as fashion designer Edna Mode, which made me laugh a lot, and I really enjoyed watching the character. So the movie was a well-written portrait of family and action, and I thought this was a unique change in the making of Pixar flicks. ""The Incredibles"" is not one of the best Pixar movies, but this is still a fun and entertaining motion picture that even if the action is too PG-13 similar, kids can still have fun watching.

Never before have I seen a company on a winning streak such as this. The film had just about everything from an excellent storyline to supercool powers. It allows time for each superhero to shine and show off their abilities. It gives us what we want to see. The parallelism between being heroes and a family was simply just outstanding, beautiful. It is so wonderful how these writers can mix in family theme with the ever-so-popular superhero theme. One sits there being able to relate to one's own family. Of course it has cool visuals and effects. Many times I found myself forgetting that this was animated. There is nothing negative I can say about this film, and usually I can pinpoint the little things.

The relation with Bob and his family members are honest and quite hilarious at times. It's action scenes feel like a bunch of spectacular conclusions of other action movies one after the other without seeming predictable or unnecessary.

It is truly an amazing achievement by this company. Each and every one of their films has gotten better. A part of this can be attributed to technical proficiency of the art form, but more important is the terrific stories. I really enjoyed myself throughout this entire film and often had my jaw open in amazement during the action scenes. And one more important achievement of this film is the unique vision that Brad Bird brought to the table. It really offsets ""The Incredibles"" from any previous Pixar film. The PG rating is a bit telling in that my 5 year old daughter didn't enjoy this one half as much as her mom and myself,but from 7 or 8 on everyone will love this film. I do not mean to imply that ""The Incredibles"" is too intense for 6 and under. I'm just not sure it plays as well to them as say a Shrek or a Disney animated tale. Of course it may play better to boys of that age. Which brings me to my next observation. NO way , and I repeat NO Way will Pixar outdo themselves once again in 2005.

Unlike most Pixar movies, this one had some good action scenes, I was quite surprised and very impressed at how the fighting and action was choreographed and done in computer animation. I could talk about the movie, but that would be pointless. My only advice to you is to go see this movie and enjoy every single bit of it, like I did. Well, I'll just some it up all up for you, a basic story. Superheroes retire then go back in action when the world is threatened again, but you already knew that so quit wasting your time and see the blasted movie already.",

Once again Pixar and those people at Disney have put in enough humour for the grown ups along with all of the good clean wholesome fun that you want your kids to see. There were no moaning kids during this film, even though the popcorn had run out well before the trailers started. It's quite long, 2 hours, which is long for younger children but they sat still throughout the entire film. In fact the kids were so impressed my older two took themselves off to the cinema with their pocket money to see it 3 days later. ",

The animation style fits very well with the premise of the film, and it works well with the action scenes (which would normally be too over-the-top for an animated movie). The characters, as I learned from Bobsheaux, are all the same model but given slight adjustments in body, face, or both in order to make unique characters: one of the most ingenious methods of saving budget and production time. The jokes, while somewhat out of place in a movie of its type, are actually competent at setting off chortles. There are some dull moments, sure, and there are some questionable scenes (the plane strike particularly, as Mode's super suits are indestructible, therefore they could have survived the fall normally), but this is a film that you will want to check out. Long before Disney was interested in Marvel, this was all we had and we didn't mind. The best word to describe it is incredible (therefore the title of the movie and of this review).",

For my money, ""Toy Story II"" was the best Pixar film; up until I saw ""The Incredibles"", that is. Now I'm not sure. After a second viewing, perhaps, things will be more clear. What is clear is that this is a remarkable film, one of the year's best. ""Shrek 2"" isn't fit to kiss it's boot. Pixar has always cast actors, rather than stars, in their films, and their outstanding casting work continues here; the only person who sticks out is Samuel L. Jackson, but he's just so cool that it doesn't matter. Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter are superb performers, and everyone contributing does a great job (including the director, Brad Bird). The film deals with some quite mature subject matter for a children's' film, including marital difficulties, midlife crises, and the hardships of normal life. The action in this film is a leap beyond anything that has ever been animated before, and puts most action movies to shame. I look forward to Brad Bird's next project, which I'm praying will be a sequel.",

But, lots of people are still unhappy with them, claiming sometimes that they didn't wanna be saved, have suffered injuries during those rescues, and so on. Super-heroes nation-wide are being sued for everything they've got. So they're put into a special government protection where their pasts are erased, identities are protected and they can live normal lives on the condition they never use their powers again.

The first is that it manages to create a universe of believable superhero characters without relying on the deep history of Marvel or DC. The other reason is that it deals with a theme that is all too common for adults-the feeling that we have made bad choices and that we wonder how we ended up in the situations we find ourselves. When you are an adult, the dreams that sustained you as a younger person are dead. And I think most people would be tempted if someone gave you the opportunity to feel as you did back then. This is the brillance of Pixar, other films for children include jokes for the adults to keep them entertained, like Shrek, but Pixar's themes are for the most part adult things, with film elements to keep the children entertained.",

Though they may have started off small in the two-dimensional world of the nickel comic-books, their popularity began to grow and expanded into spectacular franchises that were developed in the areas of television series, movies, and merchandising. Some have done better then others  as of this writing, Ben Affleck is still not speaking to Tobey Maguire  but no matter what the success, there will always be an audience for these fascinating figures. What is the cause for our fascinating fixation with these individuals and their seamlessly conventional plot-lines that are all basically a regurgitation of the vintage hero myth? In a way, we understand what the hero is going through and connect with the overwhelming obstacles that block his/her path to achieving his/her goal, what ever that may be.

It had a certain quietness to it where jokes don't need to be happening every few seconds (which Disney tries to do a lot--which also tries to cover up the shallowness of their storytelling), because, well, the whole idea and genre is funny in itself. The whole idea of an overweight, aging superhero working in an ill-fit cubicle with that certain expression on his face speaks volumes. It's not a type of joke you get by trying to verbally explaining it to somebody. Unlike the previous Pixar film ""Finding Nemo,"" this film goes for a more minimalistic, almost 2-D in nature, more expressive and animated. It's not breath-takingly realistic (although there are moments that blew me away) as it's more stylized, cartoony. Some will complain about certain slow spots as the story builds on the characters and situations (not much unlike Iron Giant), but that's where moments of clever ideas and dialogue sets in.

interview at the beginning. Instead of acting like some super cool swag superhero they are just
normal people with powers. It sounds like a normal conversation and I like superhero movies that don't just make the main character have no personality outside of being a superhero. I would like to think this is pretty realistic, because after superheroes become illegal, Bob really has nothing to do in life so he gets a boring office job. First of all I do not have a job in an office so I don't relate much to that standpoint, but even though I am not a superhero I think that superheroes becoming illegal would be very bad and lead to a pretty depressing life. I love the beginning alone but other things about this is the moments of comedy are great, and the action is surprisingly fantastic.

Mr Incredible and his wife Mrs Elastigirl let you pass good times. Mr Incredible who is a public hero works like a superpowered policeman. Wherever he is needed he appears there and helps the people. Our extraordinary hero is wanted to retire because his actions disturb some people and government. After that he starts to live like other people. But heroism instinct is hidden in a place where it waits for execution. A boy who names himself as Incrediboy grows up and kills all the super heroes. Just an ex-hero Mr Incredible remains to remove. At that point Mr Incerdible is trapped by the man who is oldly ""Incrediboy"" or newly ""Syndrome"".",

Also the family scenes were terrible because all you can hear was bickering from the little twits.. it was a total waste of time, money, and probably for the creators even if they don't admit it.. I have to say the first time I saw it I thought it was OK...

438,25 April 2019,theterminator-92378,8, truely one of the best disney pixar films,"The early 2000s were the days where superhero movies were just coming into there own and disney pixar were deciding a superhero movie would be a great idea and in a time where some of the superhero movies were cringy and ok at best this is one that gets underlooked as a superhero movie and even now it still holds up as a aninmated action/spy thriller/superhero movie but it's also a detailed look at a American family who happen to have super powers and it can change the entire family dynamic.
the cast is Craig T. Nelson Bob Parr / Mr. Incredible, Holly Hunter Helen Parr / Elastigirl, Samuel L. Jackson Lucius Best / Frozone, Jason Lee Buddy Pine / Syndrome, Dominique Louis Bomb Voyage, Spencer Fox Dashiell 'Dash' Parr, Sarah Vowell Violet Parr and Brad Bird Edna 'E' Mode. Growing up watching this movie these voices of these actors sticks with me and the preformaces one is because i watched this movie way to much as a kid and the other reason is beacause well the performances are just incredible no pun intended so the entire cast just can't be replaced because i strongly connect growing up with hearing there voices as a chracter that i enjoy watching on screen.
The Incredibles is well just amazing the way that it becomes a commentary on the family dynamic with a loving but sometimes strained marrage the social awkward teenager trying to fit in the younger boy who is just filled to the brim with energy and obviously a baby doing baby things and they do a great job with adding things like super powers and it can change the dynamic and make it 50% worse than it already is. Also Sydrome is such a great villian all of his actions become so justifible when you realise what he went through and then you understand that he was just a troubled boy who wanted to be a superheo when he was told he retaliated like a child because deep down he was still a child because that was taken from him.
The Incredibles is such a great movie if you haven't seen it it's a must watch and you should check it out for me it's a solid 8/10",

You also don't get the feeling you are watching a kids movie the whole time. In fact, a lot of animated movies lately have seemed more adult than the cartoons in the past. That's good though, cartoons also seem more intelligent now than they used to be. I would recommend the Increadibles for anyone who likes animated films. It's a decent movie. It's not one of those movies that holds up quite as well after the second or third viewing. I saw it in theaters when it first came out. Then once in school, then once while in the library. I was kind of tired of it after the 3rd time. This is a pretty solid pixar film, though maybe not the best one. I think other pixar movies, such as Cars, and WALLE, are just as good if not better. But I think that The Increadibles is still an improvement over Monster's Inc, and A Bug's Life. It's a good movie for kid's to watch, without being too childish for adult's to enjoy.",

Which make the film relatable to anyone. I throughly enjoy the visual cinematography that went into the film.

I believe that even if this movie was made to entertain, it also was made thinking of all kind of persons, not only children but adults as well, maybe some parts of the movie will not appeal to the little ones but at the end, it will be a great entertainment for children and adults as well. Each of the characters is well developed and most of them are smart in their own way and very fun to watch.

I wasn't particularly looking for serious character development but Brad Bird does a great job with Mr.Incredible, voiced by Craig Nelson, who suffers a mid-life crisis. I think most men would probably relate to him even without having super powers. I'm not sure if kids will appreciate all of that, but it certainly it will help all those men out there take there little kiddies out and still enjoy the film.

Incredibles is no exception. And they keep abreast of inside jokes and pop culture references without sacrificing the story and characters. All technical and story elements are at the disposal of the characters and not the other way around. That is the way to make touching movie experiences!",
463,3 February 2014,jmitrani750,9, The Incredibles from a deeper perspective,"The most profound and prevalent theme the movie, ""The Incredibles,"" has to offer is its paradoxical correlation between superiority and conformity. Being superior entails a relationship between two or more individuals. In this movie, the main characters were considered super heroes due to intrinsic physical abilities that enabled them to do what the average man couldn't. Throughout the first scene of the movie, the viewer is reminded how society deemed these individuals. Super heroes in ""The Incredibles"" were initially lauded because they devoted their powers and lives to noble causes and the maintenance of justice. However, in an era of American history that championed normalcy, being superior was not desirable. Conformity embraces those that seek to fit in and shuns those that exhibit any differences. While being ""super"" implies an advantage, the movie captures poignantly portrays having super human abilities as a disadvantage. Hence, the viewer is forced to come to the following paradoxical conclusion. While having super powers was once advantageous, in a society that emphasizes conventionality, being different in any sort of way is deemed unacceptable. On a figurative level, I guess one could ponder the statement the film tries to make as the protagonist struggles to live his mundane life. While he is not destitute or poverty stricken, Bob Parr is trapped within the confines of 21st century suburbia. Ironically, the world's strongest man is powerless against the forces and burdens or society, and his coerced into taking a terrible job as opposed to living out his ambitions. While no one can relate to the super human strength that our main character exhibits, many can empathize with his loss of ardor and vigor in the face of the banalities of life. Bob Parr was once Mr. Incredible, conveying this through his super powers and his steadfast dedication towards justice. Society has forced this man to hide his powers and subdue his natural inclinations to help those in need. Many adults entering their respective fields often experience this type of loss as they ascend up their respective ranks. Lawyers seeking to represent the oppressed or prosecute the wicked often become disenchanted with the sleaziness of state and federal bureaucracies. Doctors hoping to treat patients who lack financial means often run into trouble a myriad of factors, such as insurance problems, inadequacies of public hospitals, and the disparity of wealth between private practice and public health officials. Businessmen hoping to reallocate wealth in this country and solve our nation's crushing inequality tend to succumb their personal whims and horde more wealth for themselves. If you still don't believe this movie demonstrates the theme of the loss of nobility in the face of conformity, and how this manifests itself in the workplace, consider Bob's regular job. Bob is an insurance salesman, a profession dedicated to helping those affected by adversity. However, his insurance company, like the society around it, has abandoned its morals. Rather than help those affected by tragedy, Bob is instructed to simply let his clients wallow in their misery. When he attempts to finance claims beneath his boss's nose, he is censured and nearly fired. The connection I want to reiterate boils down to relationship between being super and being normal. Whereas one could accomplish the former through superhuman abilities or standing up for what's right, it seems though people lose this throughout their adult lives. Being normal is easier than being super. If society continues to advocate for conformity and repress any ability that would enable one to transcend the burdens of life, then we will lose all of our superheroes, both fictional and non fictional.",

However, it is when you examine the mundane that you realize that Mr. Bird's own ideology is transferred to screen. Besides having an ineffective token African American character and a control freak stay-at-home mother, Bird likes to have ElasticGirl instill fear within her kids (probably justified given the circumstances of the film). She warns them that the villains at hand are not like the Saturday morning cartoons villains, they will not exercise any restraint because they are faced with children, they will kill them if given the chance. The following, very well done, chase, provides justification for her comments. But there has been so much fake creation of fear recently in real life that you can't but grind at such a suggestion.",

However, The Incredibles out did them all and by far is the best of all the Pixar/Disney cartoons. The key idea I got from this movie is that having a family is the best adventure to have even if you are a superhero. The characters are of fine quality and each has their own power that makes them each unique in their own way. First we have Mr. Incredible, the father figure trying to recapture his superhero days in a society where superheroes can't use their powers. Also realizes that you don't need much to be a superhero. Next we have Elastic Girl, Incredible's wife that tries to keep the family together and rescue her husband from danger. Then we have the kids, one who is super fast and the other who can become invisible and make force-fields. Finally, Fro-Zone, a family friend to the Incredible family and sidekick to Mr. Incredible, who has the ability to freeze anything he touches.",

This is how in my mind the great Fantastic Four should have been transferred to the screen instead of the shallow film we got awhile back. The Incredibles deals with family issues and quarreling in a way that gets through to both adults and children it is wonderful. Being a student of animation myself I found this film to be an incredible achievement with its ability to use human like forms and animate them so well. Brad Bird who not only directed this, but provided the incredibly hilarious voice for Edna Mode created a wonderful family of supers that we can love and feel for their rather different problems.

506,28 April 2005,Jurgen E Haug,4, Not so great,"I decided to go and see that film after seeing the commercials/trailers on TV. It looked like smart fun, for grown-ups as well as kids. Since my daughter came after Christmas for a week, I thought that's a good chance to see it. It's a cartoon about a family of ex-superheroes (Dad is super-strong, Mom is flexible, like she can stretch her arms 10 metres) and their two teenage kids and a baby. Ex-superheroes because all the superheroes got sued by people that got hurt by them in the process of getting rescued, silly things like that. Well it's completely imaginable that some American lawyers would come up with such ideas, just think of the granny that sued McDonald's because the coffee was too hot - give me a break! Anyway all the super-heroes retired to live a normal live, secretly, unknown to be those ex-superheroes. But since Daddy is a bit of the body builder stereotype (all muscles no brains) he gets the family into trouble with a bad guy and they have to fight. So apart from the story, which was okay, how did the film fare? I would say it was plenty of fun for my daughter, but it's not exactly what I would call a good cartoon that is also recommendable for grown-ups. If you're curious about the films, see all the trailers you can find on-line, and then you have seen all the good stuff of the film. The rest is a bit boring and a bit too long.",

The Incredibles above all not only succeeds as a great family friendly film but surpasses most other family films. This is trait is thanks to the fact that the tones, jokes, and themes of the film never seem to get too campy or childish, and maintain a sense of maturity that most teens and adults can appreciate. The Incredibles also makes sure to maintain a level of simplicity that makes it easy to follow for kids. Add together the fact that it is a visually stunning film, even for an animated movie.

527,23 March 2005,maccaveili,9, The name fits,"I found ""The Incredibles"" to be much better than anticipated. I'm not real big on Pixar movies, but they are growing on me thanks to movies like this. The opening scene where you see Mr and future Mrs. Incredible meeting at the scene of a crime, on the same day of their marriage to be, was just hilarious. Little did I know they already knew each other, let alone were getting married that night. Disney did a very good job of showing the flirtatious side of the two superheros there, had me laughing my butt off. The movie though, took a very slow pace for while the superheros were trying to live just normal lives, with very little action. But it made up for it in the 2nd half of the movie when Mr. Incredible (Bob) got into trouble and his wife (who thought he was cheating on her) and his kids (who snuck along with their mom) flew out to try to save Bob. One of the most riveting scenes was during the plane ride in to save Bob and the heat seeking missiles were chasing the plane with his wife and kids. It sounded as emotional as you would expect it to sound in a real life situation. Anyways, in the end, you learned that the youngest (baby) also had powers that were not revealed the entire movie before that, so it was a good ending. Everything came full circle, even down to the detail of the costume designer not wanting to put a cape on Mr. Incredible's uniform since she claimed it was responsible for several superhero's deaths. In the end, it was Syndrome's cape, fittingly that cost him his life. A well thought out movie, and very entertaining for the most part. I gave it a nine.",
528,6 March 2005,lec632s,10, So close to perfection!,"First things first- I didn't like Shark Tale, and Finding Nemo was borderline. My sister loves Finding Nemo, and it's my niece's favorite show (I don't know how they feel about Shark Tale), but Finding Nemo is not one I'm going to put on voluntarily. The Incredibles, though- that one I plan on buying. The movie starts by setting the scene, the way it should. Two superheroes, Bob and Helen, on top of their game, (and I love the way the ""interviews"" bring out their personalities) fall in love and get married. There's a little foreshadowing (well, not going to give that one away) and life changes suddenly, drastically. Forced to mothball his superhero outfit, Bob is hurt, bewildered, and even a little resentful. And this change doesn't just effect them- it effects their children, too. I read another posting that described the feelings of their girl, Violet, perfectly. She's a teenager, and if teenagers don't have a hard enough time already, she has a special power that she is forbidden to use, which makes her feel like it's something to be ashamed of. Stuck between a rock and a hard place (aka- protecting people and a greedy boss), Bob loses it- and then he loses his job. Then something happens that seems like the perfect solution. He gets what he wants, and his family doesn't have to move (again). He jumps at it, but doesn't realize how far down he can fall. I saw most of it coming, but that was due to the expert foreshadowing and the total believability of the characters (knowing by their previous actions and temperaments what they would do when facing a given situation), and not to a tired, cheesy plot. I loved the strong family ties, the strong friendships, the think-on-your-feet feeling that permeated the whole movie! This is not just another eye-catching, flashy show geared towards making you dash to the nearest telephone booth when you leave. This is the second time I've watched it, and if you're like me, you'll be checking your watch as you leave the theatre to see if you have enough time to watch it again. The movie's emotions are so real, so well done that you are drawn completely in. You'll laugh out loud at the wry wit, cry when they feel like crying, and get mad when they get hurt. Now, if I could change one thing, it would have been the very end, when the impossibly outrageous new villain comes to the surface. Puh-leaz!

It has reasonable scripting, a predictable storyline, does not really take computer animation to new limits, and, while funny does not compare with the likes of Shrek, Toy Story, Monsters Inc or Finding Nemo (let alone a host of other superior animated films commercially unrecognised). This film is one more Pixar film to add to a growing list of adequate, fun, family films which despite being enjoyable really do add little to ""film"" as a whole.

How about 'The Incredibles'? I know a lot of people will question the sanity of a man who says such things, but consider for a moment the merits of my case. The 'Best Picture' accolade (whenever presented, by whichever group) recognizes the highest achievements in film making and in all the individual endeavors that make up a film. On this basis, I call 'The Incredibles' the best film of the year. The animation was superb, on par or better than any FX done in any other film in 2004. The acting, especially Holly Hunter's Elasti-Girl, was amazing (and yes voice-over is still considered acting). The script was as inventive and fresh as anything since 'Pulp Fiction' stunned the nation a decade ago. And the soundtrack is one of the finest musical achievements I have ever witnessed, hearkening back to the great big, brassy sounds of the 1960's spy and action adventure films. This film pays tribute the comic book genre without playing down to the crowd and it moves with a pace that actually asks you to pay attention and stay alert, a rare thing in today's cinema.",

The viewer is almost seamlessly drawn into the intelligent and technically well crafted storyline right from the start. I can only imagine how long we will have to wait, until we're fortunate enough to see another movie of this calibre.

544,7 November 2004,Ziman,8, Another winner from Pixar,"In recent years, since the success of X-Men, we've been bombarded with superhero comic-to-screen conversions some doing a good job, others not so good. Needless to say, it's a new genre that seems to already be getting tired of itself as well as the fan interest. The Incredibles however is a refreshing new superhero film. Unlike the recent lore, it's not based on a comic book series and therefore does not need to conform to nor preserve any preconceived notion of what it 'ought' to be. Instead it is a completely unique creation from the folks at Pixar animation, who once again have dished out a winner.",

Mr. incredible is like superman on steroids, its awesome when he is just a regular citizen and one night a week just sits and listens to the scanner and saves people. his kid flash is much be doing coke or something because he cant be that fast without doing it, its like he has ADD or something. the bad guy is just some retarded kid that thinks he is smart, Mr incredible should have pounded his head in when he was a kid.",

I also love watching mom's kick butt to save their families! It was a bit more violent than I was expecting--I wouldn't recommend it for the very-young. There's nothing graphic, mind you--this IS Disney--but there's the suggestion of a lot of death, so use your own judgment of your own kids. Mine's 14, so I had no trouble there (except in getting her to go!). It still boils down to good-IL' Disney fun, and it was definitely worth the wait!",

The movie was OK in the beginning, but especially in the end the fighting kept going on and on and on. Even when they had defeated the monster, they kept adding more fight scenes. The short, however, was really funny; the people in the theater clapped for the short but not the movie. I think that The Incredibles should be watched on DVD or VHS, but it wasn't worth my money.",
548,30 November 2004,toddinvestor,7," a good movie, BUT ...","... not incredible. Perhaps I went in with expectations too high. For sure, Pixar comes through with another brilliant animation display. The neverending variety of scenes, many at high speed, are enjoyable to watch on the big screen. Character development is also good. Each Incredible is given a decent amount of screen time though Mr. Incredible is the featured hero throughout. I enjoyed Dash, the young boy flying around at incredible speeds. So, what is not to like? Well, as good as the movie is, it drags with a 2 hour running time. There is humor here and there but not enough to compensate for the lengthy dialogue sequences. ""The Incredibles"" carries itself like an adult drama too often, and the kidlets in the theatre I was in were getting restless. It is like an animated James Bond, with all the chase scenes to go with it, and talking too. Too much in fact. Though I enjoyed it, I did not leave feeling compelled to see it again. Neither did my 10 year old nephew. That makes ""The Incredibles"" good, but not great. 7/10 Note: wouldn't recommend it for younger children, too intense and scary for the young ones",

550,28 April 2005,curtman2,10, Paramount Pixar- Engineered to Perfection,"""The Incredibles"", without question, falls nowhere short of its title: a spectacular pack of dynamite thrills, comical and compelling humor, and stupendously dazzling visuals, an animated masterpiece for both adventure-craving children and cynical, adulterated parents alike, transcending a seemingly trite and cartoonish premise into marvelous entertainment that delivers all the goods that should be the standard for all Hollywood productions. Beginning with the exploits (or lack thereof) of a wrongfully disgraced gargantuan of a superhero Bob Parr (a.k.a. Mr. Incredible), his equally vigorous wife, and quarrelsome, prodigal children, ""The Incredibles"" could have resorted to strictly a nimble ""superheroes saving the day"" scenario, supplanting mindless action and explosion for character development and dialog. I am pleased to report that the film instead bypasses this clichéd premise and offers a simple, delightful, and often hilarious tale about a man who once conquered the scum of the earth in a supersuit, mask, and cape, who has now been reduced to intervening in family feuds, grovelling to his uptight boss, and combating the inconveniences of commute, his only escape being nights hanging out with his ex-superhero buddy Frozone (""Where's my supersuit?"") and reliving the ""golden days""; a perfectly endearing story we could all relate to and appreciate. Cleverly written, and with various cultural jabs (e.g. frivolous lawsuits), this story in and of itself would be plenty to be enjoyed; then again, with Pixar at the helm, it had to live up to its name and succeed as dynamite entertainment, now didn't it? One hilarious escapade leads to another, and soon enough, you guessed it, Bob Parr is once again called to arms as ""Mr. Incredible"". The dialog here is truly ingenious, offering distinct dimensions to each and every character and giving them their own valuable, memorable traits- with the family, these traits are brilliantly infused into their roles of action, which in effect, elevates all of their actions as superheroes to gratifying heights of excitement. Surprisingly enough, hardly ever is the dialog in this ""family-oriented flick"" ever bland or cheesy; it's almost entirely fresh and original, and always amusing. The visuals, without mention, are absolutely dazzling: the action mixes richly with the colors, the explosions are sheer dynamite- an amazing feat for ""animation"", and the characters' facial features and motions very much satisfy their accepted personalities; this is perhaps the most wonderful, ground-breaking animation I've ever seen displayed in film. The manner in which the film somehow achieves the weight of being a perfectly innocuous ""family flick"", gratifyingly clever and original comedy, and delivering some dynamite bang-for-your-buck, is enough to solidify this Pixar wonder (would you expect anything else from Pixar?) as a masterpiece. ""The Incredibles"" works ably and incredibly at balancing and surpassing so many expectations, and sustains itself from becoming a clichéd, brainless animated actioner, and rather succeeding as a clever, fresh, and marvelously rollicking entry in both the superhero and animated comedy genres. ""Dahling, Dahling... For incredible, eye-popping entertainment, rejoice with ""The Incredibles"": it offers nearly everything that's been sorely missing in the doldrums of Hollywood entertainment today. **** out of ****",

""The Incredibles"" is filled with action and entertainment that will have you on the edge of your seat. The animation is absolutely breath-taking and the characters are creative and lovable. You'll find yourself lost in the world that Pixar has created and awe at the stunning visual effects that make ""eye candy"" seem like an insult. Bring the whole family!

559,18 September 2008,Fred_Maxwell,8, Pixar bats another one out of the park.,"The Incredibles is a fun little film when you watch it; interesting, kind of engaging, but nothing terribly special; it's doesn't reach out and grab hold of your throat and slap you around the room with its greatness the way Monsters, Inc. does. It's only later, when you've reflected on the little details for a while, that you come to realize how much of this film is simply, as the kids say these days, made of awesome. Bird, one of the better directors in the Pixar stable, filled this sucker chock-full of fun in-jokes for the adults whilst keeping the action coming for the kiddies. In this installment of the great Pixar dynasty, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has been forced into retirement after a rescue gone terribly wrong in the opening scenes. Mundane life is, shall we say, not treating him terribly well. He and his wife, the former Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), have moved to the suburbs and are trying to raise their family-- all of whom, as it turns out, seem to have inherited superpowers from their parents-- in relative obscurity. The most superhero-like thing Mr. Incredible does is get together with his old pal Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) and talk over old times. Until, that is, he receives a secret message saying that his powers are needed... It's a fun movie, the kind of thing you expect from Pixar-- lots of action, witty dialogue, visual gags, a good time to be had by all. You'll enjoy it. But then, go and read the trivia page over at IMDb and marvel at the number of in-jokes in this movie. There are homages to what seems like every superhero comic, every movie any of these actors has ever worked in, every member of the crew. And none of them interferes with the movie's plot or pacing. That's brilliant. Either Bird is the world's biggest geek and had this entire thing cast before he started writing, or his eye for detail is unparalleled. (Or both.) It's the technical equivalent of the emotional punch of Monsters, Inc., and what makes it great is trying to think of another studio that could have cranked those two movies out back-to-back-- and not being able to come up with one.",

The characters all have superpowers we've seen before, nothing new there. The villain was extremely annoying, I know its supposed to be a kids movie but in a superhero flick, the villain has to stand out. This has to be the most overrated movie, unless everyone who voted is less than 13 years old. I was thoroughly disappointed. Now that Pixar is ending its tenure with Disney, lets hope that they start making more contemporary movies with their animation skills. And one more thing, Toy Story 3 will ruin that franchise.",

565,10 November 2004,schuhj,10, They have perfectly executed what they sought to do.,"IMHO this is the best of all the superhero movies. One gets the feel of a comic book, with the humor--including a malicious comic heavy--reminding me of the original Captain Marvel comic books. The characters are ""human"" enough to grab our sympathy but ""cartoonish"" enough that we suspend our disbelief gladly to see them exercise their magical powers. In some ways this is as ground- breaking as ""Snow Whites,"" even though ""Polar Express"" has more of the same ""feel"" as the Disney movie. It has, I think, taken what old Disney films did in two dimensions and extended it into three. The voice characterizations are well-done. It may be nothing peculiar to this film, but the actors seems to have fun doing things verbally that they cannot get away with while doing live action. I expect to see sequels of this. Indeed the film ends with the cliff-hanger than seems to lead us toward one.",

567,5 September 2007,rickhavoc1,10, Fantastic Job by Pixar and Brad Bird,"First, it's the most realistic looking animation I've ever seen. The water looks like water, the characters' hair looks like hair, etc. I think the primary purpose of any movie is to tell an entertaining story, and to use the story to explore truths that never change. Brad Bird delivers this in SPADES! I'm going to hit on the high points. One is where a series of lawsuits forces the government to place all the ""supers"" in a ""witness protection"" type program and prohibit them from using their special abilities. This commentary on our litigious society alone makes the movie worth seeing. Another is where Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible first loses his job, then gets a mysterious message from a woman offering him the chance to use his abilities. He jumps on it, and goes to a remote island where the woman, Mirage, tells him there's a robot called the Omnidroid running amok, and has to be subdued without destroying it. He does so, using his brains as much as his brawn, and tears his old costume in the process. He then goes to the woman who designed it, Edna Mode. She's a cross between ""Q"" from James Bond and a fashion designer. She doesn't just want to repair his old costume, she wants to design him a new one. He muses aloud about adding a cape. Edna goes ballistic, shouting ""NO CAPES!"" When he disagrees, she brings up examples of ""supers"" who got their capes caught on objects or sucked into jet engines and killed, and he relents. No comic book I ever read explored the disadvantages of a superhero wearing a cape! When Bob returns to the island, he is ambushed and defeated by an improved version of the Omnidroid prototype robot. He is held captive there by Syndrome, once a young fan named Buddy Pine. Buddy once wanted to be Mr. Incredible's sidekick, but was harshly rejected. Bob manages to escape from Syndrome and discovers that Syndrome has killed many of his superhero friends in the process of developing the Omnidroid. When Helen/Elastigirl finds a platinum blonde hair on Bob's clothes, she suspects he's having an affair. She then discovers the repair job on his old costume, and goes to Edna to ask her about it. Edna tells her about the new costume she designed for Bob, and reveals the matching costumes she designed for the entire family. Next, Helen is flying a Lear jet towards the locater beacon Edna installed in Bob's costume, which has caused Bob to be recaptured. She discovers two of their children, Violet and Dashiell, have stowed away in the plane, leaving the baby, Jak-Jak, with a sitter. Earlier in the movie, we saw that Violet has the powers of invisibility and force field projection, and Dashiell (Dash) has super speed. Syndrome fires missiles at them while making Bob listen to Helen's mayday calls and shoots them down. Everyone, including Bob and Mirage, assumes everyone in the plane are killed. However, thanks to Helen's abilities and her costume, (which can withstand a temperature of over one thousand degrees and is completely bulletproof), they all survive. Meanwhile, Bob grabs Mirage and threatens to squeeze her to death if Syndrome doesn't set him free. Syndrome calls his bluff, and he releases her. When Syndrome starts berating Bob for being ""weak"", she tells him, ""He's not weak, you know. Valuing life is not a weakness. And disregarding it is not strength."" Helen and the kids arrive on the island, where she tells them to hide in a cave. She then infiltrates Syndrome's HQ, just as he launches a large rocket to carry the Omnidroid to Metroville. Dash has gone deeper into the cave, and discovers that it leads to a vent for the rocket's exhaust, which is rapidly approaching. He rushes back to Violet and they escape. Later, when they're discovered by Syndrome's henchmen, they both come into their own. Dash starts running through the forest at super speed, (the scene where he runs into a swarm of insects and gets them splattered all over his face is PRICELESS), and Violet uses her invisibility to evade death. Dash has discovered that he can actually run on water, and also shows that he can THINK just as fast when one of the henchmen chases him into another cave. He sees another bad guy coming at him from inside so he just stops and sinks into the water, causing the bad guys to collide above him. He runs back into the forest, and runs right into his sister, who hasn't been able to sustain a force field. More henchmen arrive and start shooting at them, and she projects a force bubble around them. She tells Dash to start running, and he does, which brings her and the bubble with him. They literally run right into their parents. A battle with the henchmen then ensues, with the family fighting as a team. After taking out the henchmen, they go back inside, where Mirage helps them take off after Syndrome. They get to Metroville, where Syndrome tries to ""battle"" his robot, who quickly figures out he's using a remote control on his wrist and shoots it off. Meanwhile, Bob's friend Lucius/Frozone is looking for his costume so he can join the fight, and is shouting to his wife, asking her where she put it. I won't go into detail, except to say the woman needs to take some lessons from Mary Jane Watson on supporting her man. (Remember the end of Spiderman 2?) With a combination of teamwork and quick thinking, they defeat the Omnidroid, but Syndrome escapes. I won't tell you how it ends, but it's a great ending. With the voice talents of Craig T. Nelson (Bob/Mr. I), Holly Hunter (Helen/E-girl), Samuel L. Jackson (Lucius/Frozone), Sarah Vowell (Violet), Spencer Fox (Dash), Jason Lee (Buddy/Syndrome), Brad Bird (Edna Mode), and Elizabeth Peña (Mirage), it's a great movie and a great ride the whole family will enjoy. 10/10",

569,24 August 2006,brainybrailler,3," OK, but not a good kids' movie","I wasn't expecting a classic comparable to my favorite Disney movies when I saw this - nothing could surpass Toy Story in my view - but I wasn't expecting what I saw either. I enjoyed this movie somewhat when I first saw it but for each time I watched it afterwards, my opinion of it lowered rather than remained good. The plot is an interesting one with only a few problems: after being held accountable for several misfortunes such as injuring passengers when stopping a train heading for a bomb-made track gap, or ""rescuing"" but injuring a suicidal man (in a kids' movie?), Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) becomes the victim of lawsuits while his fellow ""supers"" are convicted or at least suspected of causing other problems (the most specific I can recall is that their masks let them spy on women - what a dark subject!), until it's declared they must hang up the suits and live as private citizens. 15 years later: though some of Mr. Incredible's last public words were his wishing to have less work and maybe a family, Bob Parr bitterly resents the fact that he's no longer a hero, or even a philanthropist (apparently illegally trying to literally play hero several times, he's been relocated enough that his current job, 1 of the few he hasn't tried his hand at, is insurance agent, which the 8-year-old I saw this with didn't get). He does more for his customers than his greedy boss Humph (Wallace Sheen) allows, and to compensate for his job he still attempts upholding justice while dragging best friend Lucius, once Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), along for the ride, and meanwhile seems little more than indifferent to Helen/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and their 3 kids, except he wants his 10-year-old son who has the gift of speed to compete in sports where he'd have an unfair advantage. When Humph catches on that he's illegally helping customers and Bob loses his temper enough to throw him through a wall, he declines the offer to relocate again - but accepts an offer from ""Mirage"", claiming to be a fellow ex-hero who needs his help in destroying an amok robot. Having done this, he actually feels fine about life and does become closer to his family - until he's duped into meeting his employer (Jason Lee), who reveals himself to be a jealous, obsessed fan who wants revenge for his rejection of him when he was a kid. He learns that Buddy Pine, now known as Syndrome, has in fact gone mad, killing off many heroes (maybe all, since the only 3 shown definitely alive are himself, Elastigirl, and Frozone who appears to be his next target). Learning that his real goal is to ""defeat"" his own creations after unleashing them and thus becoming the world's sole superhero, the protagonist, now filled with regret over neglecting his family and endangering his friend (maybe their being seen together when Bob's discovered is why Frozone's location is known?), must call on his family to help him and outsmart Syndrome. Really, it's not a bad story except for a few dark elements here and there - still, there are other things to look at. Acting was good, but it couldn't improve the uneven tone of the movie; Syndrome joked about the heroes' having ""got busy"" as far as having kids, another joke which youngsters won't get, yet earlier the idea of his taking out heroes is underplayed - it's only a certainty when 1 whom we never meet but is mentioned as missing (noted since he too was resistant to adjusting to life without a mask) is shown on his list of targets dealt with, and was hard even for the adults I saw watching it to believe. There are some good scenes such as the daughter, who unlike her brother adheres to the family rule about ignoring her power (forcefields), gains self-confidence to use it for help, or Mirage's knowledge that indifference isn't strength, but these lessons are almost completely forgotten in other, twisted messages: (SPOILERS) Parr disregards the law and attempts to remain a hero (admittedly to a point one can sympathize since the community has gone far enough to crush individuality by making a ceremony of a grade's being passed) - and ends up protecting and being thanked by the ungrateful community that once rejected him; (SPOILERS END) Helen's advice of humility is tossed aside, while Dash (SPOILER), who does unfairly beat his track competitors (SPOILERS END), is ""right"" in his reminder that everyone's being special means nobody is, when Syndrome echoes it later. It seems even the youngest kid could realize faster than Helen that it wasn't pride but concern for his family that made Bob want to fight solo in the climax. For some reason the writers don't explain, crimes (obviously) continue in the decade-and-half long absence of heroes - though villains, such as the poorly-worked cliché French joke that is Bomb Voyage (and I'm sure there are some just as stupid as Underminer, who pops up later declaring war against peace and happiness), are also out of business...but I doubt they retired from growing bored with having nobody to oppose them! Lucius/Frozone is the coolest and my favorite character, but he has too little screen time even if it makes sense that he is absent for most of the middle since he never learns of his friend's imprisonment. (SPOILER); But why isn't he honored with a limo ride with the main family after their works? (SPOILERS END) I still see the true morals and his character as highlights of the movie, but I wish there was more I could enjoy.",

Luckily, movies like The Incredibles come along once in a while to renew one's faith in cinema. This is a really fun, smart film. A once-avid reader of comics myself, I loved the various ways in which this movie paid homage to superhero comics; my wife, who never read or collected comics, also thoroughly relished this movie. The CGI is great, but that's not enough to make a film good, let alone excellent. The story is cohesive, and doesn't feel like it's been written by committee. I didn't see any product placement. The acting is sharp. The interplay among the characters is believable. I can't think of any way in which this film could have been improved in any significant way. Even the end credits were cool - probably the best end credits I've seen (only Ferris Bueller's credits are on par with them, although in a very different way).",

After so many half-hearted or, pardon the harshness, half-witted movies, it is awesome to see a movie (an animated movie, no less) that operates on so many levels. The movie is hilarious while it comments on society's unwillingness to accept greatness without jealousy or fear. Bob Parr (a.k.a. Mr. Incredible) said it the best, ""It's psychotic. They invent new ways to celebrate mediocrity, but when someone is truly exceptional..."" Very profound. Being in school, I see this the most clearly of all the movie's themes. Acknowledging greatness itself belittles none. Everyone is good at something. Sorry, a little bit of a sore spot for me. Moving along, the visual quality of this feature is excellent. The people at Pixar deserve a round of applause. Having programmed in 3-D a little myself, I have a little bit of an idea how much work they had to do. From the shape of the characters and the environments to the very physics of the Incredibles' world, they had to make it all. Bravo! I would love to see an ""Incredibles 2"".

I love the sequence of Helen getting stuck in all the doors. It's brilliant comedy and taking advantage of the sticky situations someone who can stretch can find herself in. I'm kind of astonished at the dark/adult content this movie deals with. Suicide? dead family? Playing getting sucked into a jet engine for laughs? Not to mention one of the most grisly Disney deaths I can think of (Others to me would be Bugs Life and Tarzan). That scene of the jet getting blown up always gets me emotionally. It's super tense and you understand both Helen and Violet's viewpoint of asking Violet to put a force-field around the plane. You're pulling for Violet and yet feel the frustration and fear of Helen. It's edited so well. Ug! I'm gushing. It's also refreshing to see a full family in a family movie. Disney has a lot of broken/single-parents and I get it. It saves money to not have siblings or two parents. it's less complicated. it makes kids like that feel better. But it's so nice to see a movie about family and about what they can accomplish together and show what a family can be. It's really encouraging. One of Pixar's best. Oh, and Edna is wonderful. duh",

However, the task is not that easy for Mr. Incredible and the wish to regain his previous fame is high. Hiding it from his family, he starts to accept new missions from an unknown source. 
The Incredibles was one of the very first movies I went to see in the cinema and that I remember well. Though I was only six years old, I still enjoyed it very much. But the most striking aspect for me is that rewatching it fourteen years later still sparks in me the same joy and interest I had the first time, and I think that is one of the movie's main strength. Indeed, it has ""aged"" very well and remains up to date, funny and endearing regardless of time passing. The plot is simple and resembles that of a Marvel comic, but it differentiates itself through its characters and its animation. Indeed, first, the characters are very relatable (parents can relate to the ""mid-life"" crisis of Mr. Incredible, children can relate to Violet's insecurities or Dash's hyperactivity) and endearing, and they all have very clear personalities which makes the viewer want to care for them. Second, the animation for a 2004 is amazing and it is easy to actually forget that it is an animated movie thanks to the smoothness of the images.
Overall, The Incredibles is therefore a very enjoyable animated movie, be it for children, teens, or adults, and you will definitely smile a lot when it ends. I am very excited to see how the second one will turn out.",

Yes, some of the twists in the plot are predictable, but some are quite clever too. Besides, it is one of the best-paced and exciting films of any type. Plenty of appropriate humor. The animation is breathtaking; needs to be seen to be believed. See it on a big screen and then buy the video or DVD for home.

The characters are a complete ripoff of the Fantastic Four. It's not even funny. Throw in an Iceman ripoff and you've got a real question about the originality of this movie.

622,5 November 2004,halincoh,10, transforms animation into the future,"One of the best action films I've seen in a long time. I've read many suggestions that it is borrows from Spy Kids, James Bond, and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yes. Yes. And yes. But personally, I thought differently. Remarkably, I had the same response to this film as I had when I first saw Star Wars. For those of you who have seen this movie, your response to that statement might be, ""huh?"" Let me explain. When I originally saw Star Wars, several things happened: first , I was absorbed into a world so different than my own, but when all was said and done , it became as real as anything I've ever experienced. Secondly, we all knew then and there that this was the future of special effects. Thirdly, be it ultra cool Han Solo; wanna be hero Luke; or uber-female Princess Leia, many people could identify with the characters. This film transforms animation, like Star Wars did for it's genre, from the present into the future. It does so because everyone involved aspires to excellence. They succeed by creating animated landscapes incredibly rich in detail, by developing movement and action that is, at times, simply exhilarating, and by brilliant ""acting"" so rich with nuance, humor, and emotion that voice and drawing merges into a full fledged human. In fact, when I think about it, other than Harrison Ford, the one lingering difference between Star Wars and this film , other than the obvious - plot, was that the acting was better in this film. If you saw Star Wars ... and you did ... you saw the future of science fiction. If you see this film, you will see the future of animation. And the force is with them both.",

Pixar has always come up with great movies, starting with Toy Story and going on to create Monsters Inc. and Finding Nemo and others. This trumps them all. Brad Bird's Iron Giant was a beautiful movie, and his Incredibles also took me aback. Its PG rating was good to note. In most family films like this, villains and the bad guys aren't actually assumed dead, just gone. Here they are. That is a subtle but important aspect. The movie's plot is great, the characters are well-developed and charismatic, and the settings and action are flawlessly done. Best animated movie I've ever seen. As yet.",

Then came two of the greatest animated movies of all time, Toy Story and A Bugs Life. I loved these two movies so much that I knew, I was wrong. 3D cartoons had indeed created a pretty huge fan base, with Pixar spearheading this revolution. Incredibles is another brilliant movie by them. I love everything about it. I love how the characters are all unique in their own way, how the action sequences can be comical at the same time and most of all, I love that I can watch this with my family over and over again, and never get bored of it. That's how good it is. I may be overselling it, but mind you, it is a children's movie, and as such is created in such a way that it is easily understood by a child. This means that as adults, the storyline may seem a little underwhelming. Which is true to a certain extent. Regardless, it is without a shadow of a doubt, ENTERTAINING!

It is, in my opinion, one of Pixar's best films and yet one of the most underrated ones. Whenever someone says 'Pixar' most people will think of the Toy Story trilogy. As much as I love the Toy Story films, I think The Incredibles is better, to be honest. The plot revolves around Bob Parr who is better known as the famous superhero 'Mr. Incredible'. Things are going great for Bob, saving the citizens of Metroville and he's just about to marry Helen (better known as the superhero 'Elastigirl'), but, unfortunately, after letting a criminal go loose and accidentally leaving many people injured, Bob and Helen are forced to leave their superhero lives behind and live as normal citizens. Around 15 years later, they are happily married and have three kids (Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack). Bob also works in an office but doesn't enjoy it and dreams of being a superhero again. Luckily, he gets his chance when a mysterious message sends him a to a secret island where he battles a giant evil robot. But, as he tries to hide his secret superhero life in order to protect his family, Bob faces one of the biggest challenges ever. I loved everything about this film, not only was there lots of action and suspense, there was plenty of humour too! There are also many signs of character development. I think that this is one of the best superhero films ever, I mean, who wouldn't want to be in a family full of superheros?

Do we have to see yet another ""awkward teen"" girl who finds her confidence? She was definitely the most annoying one, but not too much so. At first, I found the animation of the characters a little extreme... they were just all so ugly. But you get used to them after a little while. The scene where they are landing in the Winnebago was fun... one of those things that every family will relate to. Good job overall.

I'll never forget how unbelievably silly it was to watch the movie three or four or five more times. Creative work always gets me started, if you know what I mean. - - - I wanted to add, after I took a look at my own review, that it's sort of strange to have to worry about how popular a movie really is. Working at the theater, people seemed to honestly enjoy their movie-going experience. I honestly loved the way all the joking around was put together in this movie. Really, really! Bad economic times and old library books make me wonder about what kind of impression my writing (of this review) makes at first, or after two or three months.

But again we have the same problem. Just the same problem from Finding Nemo. This movie is too long. The story in general is fine, but is some scenes were cut or shortened the movie would be much better. Some special effects are great but the characters design should be improved. Bob looks like a fat giant with a little head. Violet is like a stick with a basket ball on top and Mirage is even worse. Her face was fine, but while watching this film I always kept thinking that sometime her legs could break. Jack-Jack was just weird. Edna was so ugly. The only convincing character was Helen. Some positive points are the domestic relationship between Bob and Helen and some adult themes (the suspect that Helen had that her husband could be cheating on her).

It was hilarious in very original ways i.e. the cape.....trust me...It's classic. I can't find anything wrong with this film, nothing offensive or of-color. I'm surprised by the direction of Brad Bird. This was a great film unlike Iron Giant. This film had the perfect blend of timing, sound, and humor involved that has helped us enjoy cartoon series such as The Simpsons and Family Guy.

The whole ""we have to conceal our powers from the world, and only use them when we have no other option"" was so very X-Men. And the message as I understood it seemed callous. If everyone has powers it's the same as no one having powers. So not everyone is special in their own way? Harsh. Isn't that what we've been trying to teach our kids all this time?

But, when I finally saw the movie on cable, I had to admit, I actually liked it, a lot! Let me lay out their powers: Mr. Incredible: 1. Super strength (ala DC Comics Superman, Uncle Sam) Ms. Incredible: 1. Stretching ability (ala Marvel's Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, DC's Elongated Man) Violet: 1. Ability to generate force fields and go invisible (ala Marvel's Sue Richards of the Fantastic Four and Jane Grey of the X-Men) Dash: 1. Super Speed (ala DC's Kid Flash) Jack-Jack: 1. Morphing Ability (his name escapes me, but I remember the Character ""The Element Man"" - I believe DC comics). After I got over my ""prejudice,"" I found the movie very well done...they spent a buck (or two) making this feature. Edna's security system just cracks me up! Finally, Congress should be mandated to watch Mr. Syndrome's character and learn from his dialogue. Particularly the line - ""When everyone's Super - no one will be..."" You see we have had Nuclear Weapons advantage over the rest of the world for over fifty years. That is coming rapidly to an end, as now everyone wants in, whether we approve or not.

One specific point in the film, when the family needed each other most, that scene unlocked the characters full potential. I enjoyed Jack-Jack fighting Syndrome at the very end, I found that hilarious. What I disliked was that the film took 30 minutes to begin, 60 minutes in the middle, 10 minutes of the end and 10 minutes of credits.

677,28 March 2005,mottaboy66,9, Story is the cake... animation and humor is the icing.,"Teaming up once again to bring an instant classic, Pixar animation studios and Walt Disney present ""The Incredibles"". Sitting down to this film, I was expecting it to be a heartwarming modern day fairytale like ""Finding Nemo"" or ""A Bug's Life"". Disney's latest animated movie delivered something a little more grown-up however. The film takes your modern nuclear family and swaps in a cast of super powered members, each with their own unique abilities that tie in with their role in the family. Mr. Incredible, who stars as the main protagonist, is a combination of the Hulk and your average middle class workaholic who is always dreaming about his younger years. His wife Elastigirl spends much of the film being pulled in several directions at once while trying to remain the perfect mother and wife. Playing the role of the younger child and average hyperactive six year old is Rush, who speeds around the entire film at an incredible rate. His older sister Violete, the shy teenager who shuts out her parents, later in the film saves the entire family several times with her ability to create forcefields and invisibility. While the movie is light in tone and humorous at parts, the focus is more so on the dynamics of family life then laughs, and each characters development and maturity is presented as a parallel to the adventures they each experience. And as always, good old Samuel L Jackson makes another appearance as the super cool hero Frozone, proving once and for all that the man is in fact trying to be in every movie every made. BOTTOM LINE: Not as gut-bustingly funny as Shrek or Monster's Inc. but a definite winner for kids and their parents to watch together. See if you can figure out which of the main characters go through the same incredible challenges you do!",

From beginning to end I was convinced that the characters were real people, due to their facial expressions, movements, and... well... everything!!! It is so nicely done that I think that in my opinion, is better than Finding Nemo, Toy Story, Monster Inc. COMBINED!!! ... well... probably it is an overstatement, but still, this movie is great, and if you haven't seen it! Please!!! GO see it while it is in theaters. But please do not expect this to be funny, because it is not meant to be a comedy, like the previous Pixar animations. But still, it plays its role pretty well and I must say, it is the greatest movie of the year so far... or at least it is up there with Garden State. After you read this review, please go see it!!!",

Everything Pixar does is high quality, but this was especially good. Considering how our country is in a state of jeopardy when in comes to family, with the high divorce rates and number of broken homes, it was refreshing to see a film where a family stuck together despite their imperfections. In the theater, there were plenty of children, though I'll have to say the ones who seemed to enjoy it most were the adults, who did a lot more laughing than the kids did. Several of the themes in the movie were a bit mature in my mind for the younger viewers.

I have to say, first of all, that the art direction alone is worth going to see this film. And I never notice things like art direction the first time I watch a film, but the way the scenes were designed from the lava-flow walls to the golden fish (not goldfish) in a tank in Edna's place, just overwhelmed me. And unlike most animated movies, this one didn't feel rushed. The humour was there, of course, and it was clear that Bird put a lot of his Simpsons experience into the film. It deserves Oscar nominations, and not just in the animated features category. If I say something like, it's better than watching Shrek 1 & 2 back-to-back, perhaps that will sum it up the most.",

Not just family or kid funny, but funny for everyone, often specifically for the grown-ups. Of all the American animated films I've seen, which might be almost all of them, this is my favorite (I like some of Miyazaki's films even better, but he is bringing magic and wonderment in a surreal world instead of pure entertainment). You'll want to see this one even if you have no kids to watch it with. There's a lot of funny stuff, but Brad Bird's Edna character is the best. My daughter liked it well enough at 2 1/2 years of age that she asked to see it several times -- she gets some of the sight gags but she'll like it even better when she gets older.

What I like about the movie- This movie builds neatly till the second half.
What I don't like about the movie- Probably the biggest flaw of this movie is that it violates pixar's own rules of storytelling.
According to a rule of storytelling by Pixar- The hero may accidently get into a problem, but the hero should never accidently get out of the problem. In simple words, the hero should never easily get out of a problem.
After the villain ties up Mr. incredible, we imagine that something big Is probably going to happen. but the villain's assistant neatly unties Mr. Incredible and lets him go.

The film has a great script, plot, characters and animation. It is also a tad more serious than other Pixar films and includes some violence, such as corpses of superheroes, people getting sucked in to plane engines and giant robots. It also has more real life issues, such as troubles with the family and law suites and isn't very peachy like other Disney films. I also liked how the characters weren't tanned, slim, muscular characters. Elastigirl wasn't a thin, ditzy girl and Mr. Incredible did not have rippling muscles, which really added to the realism of the film. Other characters such as Frozone, Edna Mode, Violet, Dash and Syndrome are also unique and humorous characters. The film has enough comedy to keep it going, but it also knows when to be serious as well. ",

For those of you do not know one of the reasons Pixar was created was to make more ""Edgy"" films that Disney would not approve of. If you do not believe me watch one of the many documentaries about the origins of Pixar or look at the origin animation tests for Toy Story. The problem that lead Pixar to not go down the ""Edgy"" rout was that they felt they could not strike a balance between being Edgy and kid-friendly. With this film they found that balance. At its core this film share a lot of themes with Alan Moore's Watchmen and both feature a society that rejects superheros. This is notable because of it sets it apart from the other Pixar films as it is one of the only ones with strictly adult themes unlike say Finding Nemo which is has mostly universal themes. ",

Though the graphics and music are impressive, the movie lacks humor, which was Pixar's specialty. There just wasn't enough of it to sustain a Pixar movie. Even ""A Bug's Life"" was funnier than this. I tell ya, if Joe Ranft was still alive, this movie might have actually been better.",

The movie pieces together plot lines and ideas from stories as diverse as Robert Mayer's SUPERFOLKS and Alan Moore's WATCHMEN to make a very human story about a very Fantastic-Four-like family that we believe in and are amazed by. I've read comics all my life, and I'm also a graphic artist - so the mental images of 'superheroes in motion' has been part of my imagination since I was a child, but Pixar and Brad Bird reinvented the wheel with so much of what these characters do on screen, in clever and emotionally realistic ways. The action scenes were better than any I've seen in even live-action films for years.... The comedy and voice acting were impeccable. Craig T Nelson and Jason Lee were amazing... Syndrome was really fun, and it's about time someone found a way to bring the character look of 'Heat Mizer' back from those old Rankin Christmas cartoons... :) If you enjoy that feeling of 'Wow, that movie was so good I wanna see it again', then go check out the Incredibles asap.

We all laughed and clapped enthusiastically at the short, but at the end of the film, not only was there no clapping, but there were many grumblings. And this was an audience of mostly adults; this was late into the film's theater time. The problem of The Incredibles, I think, was that it was geared towards older people. In Finding Nemo, Monster's Inc, and Toy Story, the attraction was that we were watching a kid's film. There was no sex, mid-life crisis, or other icky adult seriousness. That is what I was expecting in The Incredibles, and I was surprised and disappointed when it was different. The change of audience wasn't the only bad thing about The Incredibles. The ending strongly reminded me of the ending of Lord of the Rings. Much, much too long. One (at least me and my friends) would think, in this type of movie, that Mr. Incredible would defeat the monster, he and his wife would reunite passionately, not sappily, superheroes would be back in business, and maybe as an afterthought the baby would begin to show signs of powers (but not in a huge long thing with the weird kid who used to be known as IncrediBoy). But there were monsters, monsters, and more monsters. The movie ended in an unresolved conflict which is actually really good in some movies. Also, there was just way too much fighting and running and weird, cheesy names.",

Contrary to what some people have said, I don't think that a sequel would necessarily be a good idea. It is just possible that by the time a sequel is made, Pixar and Disney will have parted company for ever, and that Disney will make one of its vastly inferior sequels, such as the 101 Dalmations one a couple of years back, as they are apparently threatening to do with Toy Story.

This one is like a comic book, but it shows family, working together and saving the day. The Incredibles is no exception. In this story, the famous superhero Mr. Incredible, is always saving the day by using his superhuman strength to protect Municiberg from the dark forces of evil, with his super-stretchy wife Elastigirl and his best pal, the literally super cool Frozone, who can shoot ice and snow from his hands. But one tragic day, superheroes are not allowed to use their powers in public, because they cause too much damage to the city. The government sues and bans superheroes and forces them to retirement and puts them in the Superhero Relocation Program, which superheroes hide the powers and are deemed illegal, and have to fit in with society. 15 years later, Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl now have settled in society. They now have three kids, a daughter named Violet, who can turn invisible and project force fields, and two sons, the oldest son is a hyperactive 10 year old boy, named Dash and the youngest is a baby named Jack-Jack. Though he loves his family, Mr. Incredible has become depressed and lonely with not being able to save the day and hates working as an insurance adjuster. One day, he is called in to action by a mysterious communication, which sends him to a remote island. A spy named Mirage has given him a top secret mission to fight a savage robot called the Omnidroid. Mr. Incredible successfully defeats the robot and feels like a new man. He even has new costumes for his family, designed by his old friend, Edna Mode. During his next assignment, Mr. Incredible discovers Mirage is working for Buddy Pine, a disaffected number one fan of Mr. Incredible, whom he had rejected as a sidekick, Incrediboy. He has adopted the supervillain alias ""Syndrome"". He is intending to send his Omnidroid killing machine to Municiberg to destroy all superheroes and rule the world. And so it is up to the Incredibles to save the city and work together as a family. The Incredibles, as the name implies, is very incredible, with jazzy music from Michael Giacchino, amazing direction from Brad Bird, the voice of Edna Mode, and the story is done brilliantly by Brad. Good luck saving the world, Incredibles!",

There's just enough satire and predictability to both satisfy and amuse all but the most critical audience. And the humor is prevalent throughout, but never detracts from the point.

As the father of two young boys, I have the dubious honor of having seen every Pixar movie at least twice and this is certainly the best (though not by far). The CG studio has a knack for producing films that appeal to adults and kids, with stunning visuals, great story lines and outstanding casting. This is no exception. With a lineup that includes Hollywood stalwarts Samuel L. Jackson, Holly Hunter and (underrated) Craig T. Nelson, the film propels by at rocket launcher speed with just the right mix of comedy, action and pathos. Though a bit predictable in a couple spots, it has lightning pacing and a wonderful script. Brad Bird has invented a whole world, combining elements of early James Bond, the Jetsons and classic serial comic books. He even manages to work in references to latter day classics, such as Terminator 2. I can't wait till my kids buy me the DVD!",

801,10 February 2008,rettemich-1,10," Dose not matter how old you are, you will love it anyway!","Wow, I really liked this movie. Pixar have done it again, and they have done it good. I bought it few weeks ago because it was a long time a saw a cartoon movie, and after I watched The Incredibles I will watch more cartoons. Everything in this movie was perfect, the ""monster"", their powers, the humor, the characters and the ending was so fun that I laughed out loud. When you watch it, if you watch it, you will understand what I mean. If you like cartoons, then this is the right movie to watch on a boring day. It does not matter how old you are, you will love it anyway, and I bet that you will laugh. I give this movie 10/10",
802,10 April 2008,jacksondzerio,7, moderately incredible,Well the story is good in overall it is quite funny in the early part.They later focused on the action on defeating the bad guys. The badguys(syndrome)are more focused on revenge rather than the typical world domination.I find the movie is actionpacked and fast paced while it is less funny compared to previous pixar movie such as Finding Nemo but I think it's OK.,
803,6 July 2009,psychlubz,10, Simply fantastic!!!,"when the movie first came out in 2k4, i was given an impression by a guy that never saw the movie that the movie was babyish. i saw the movie in my house one night that same year, a cinema dubbed version too, and discarded it at first. when i did not have any choice, i watched this unclear version. WOW! it was magnificent, but i knew i did not get the maximum feel. this year, i stumbled on the clear version, and you can be sure i did not think twice. i watched it nothing less than three times!! this movie is simply fantastic!!! the first thing that impressed me was the way they twisted the usual superhero movie format and created a family of heroes. second was the magnificent sense of humor displayed in the movie throughout. third was the character development... this was the height! i can assure you that if you ask ten different people who their favorite characters are they will give different ones, though my best is Edna mode!!!! the fourth, THE MUSIC!!!! extremely fantastic! flawless, especially when Mr. incredible is searching syndromes system for the data on superheroes. MAGNIFICENT! fifth, the conversations... great!!! and much more!!! the movie is just a sensational one! ratatouille was my former best pixar movie, before i saw the clear incredibles version. i have changed my mind since then. incredibles, as far as i am concerned, is the best 3D movie ever... though i have not seen Up.",
804,31 December 2004,dewdrop_14,10, a short review for parents,I though this was a great animated movie for teens.... it may be a little old for young children (5&under) regarding some intense scenes.

My daughter and I enjoyed every minute - especially the short! The characters were easy to fall in love with and there were a few surprises along the way! Have fun and enjoy! It's a movie for every age group. We wee in a packed theater with people from every generation and it was evident from the shared laughter that we were all have a good time. I hope there will be a sequel. The story of the Incredibles needs to continue and we will be the first in line for the next edition. Go, get your popcorn and soda - and enjoy! Had a great time with The Incredibles! I know you will too!",
809,14 November 2004,dragooncancer,10, wow....just...WOW,"OK, now I really didn't know what to expect from 'The Incredibles' as I didn't really see much of trailers and such. I assumed it was a typical superhero flick, and boy was I wrong.",
810,6 November 2004,mn_cntryboy34,10," ""Inconceivable?"" NO! INCREDIBLE!","Simply one of the most fully enjoyable and entertaining movies that I've seen in a VERY long time! The theater was FULL of laughter from nearly the beginning of the movie. I've never seen an animated feather that was as well thought out as this one was. So many different slants on a superhero story were considered and added, even ones from a ""typical"" American family were included but with the superhero twist. Those just made it that much funnier. Not only is the story top rate and totally enjoyable, the animation is also. PIXAR has really taken it to a whole new level with how they've developed their animation. Its getting to the point where unless they morph everyone just a bit its tough to tell the real thing from the animation and I love that! On an informative note for those wanting to see the movie with their kids? Not only is it completely appropriate for kids (despite some adult humor sprinkled in), there's even a quaint little movie short in the beginning that seemed to enthrall all the kids. I say that because while the laughter from the crowd was loud, there wasn't a single issue from any of the children there. EVERYONE got their money's worth down to the youngest child. Absolutely a 10 on the scale and actually worth seeing a 2nd or 3rd time in my opinion. Enjoy!",
811,19 November 2004,swampthing-5,10, Best Super-Hero movie of ALL Time...,"THE INCREDIBLES is just an awesome movie (In My Top Ten list). Today (Friday) I've seen it again for the third time, and plan on watching again this weekend. I'm a huge fan of Super-Hero genre, and this really brought out the kid in me. Although I'm 25, I think that THE INCREDIBLES entertains both children and adults. Brad Bird is a great writer/director (and a good voice actor to boot. He did the voice of Edna Mode the Designer with glasses), and I pray that he gets the chance to make a sequel or a trilogy (fingers crossed). There were lots of humorous scenes, especially with Frozone, when he was looking for his super-suit. That killed me. Anyhoo, I highly recommend this movie, and I believe that you will have a great time. Five (5) Stars.",
812,6 November 2004,Trollheadhunter3,10, Incredible!,"What can I say the movie was incredible. Pixar really can't make a bad movie. They appeal to all ages and do it so well. It made me laugh a lot. The movie has a great story to go along with all the jokes too. The voice acting was extremely well done by all the cast. The powers that the superheros had were really fun to watch too. They were put into use in some hilarious scenes. The message of teamwork was also very evident in the movie. The family could only defeat Syndrome ""Jason Lee"" by working together and combining their powers. If you haven't seen it go right now it is well worth the cash. I almost didn't go because I didn't think it would be good and boy was I wrong. I recommend it for all ages.",
813,7 November 2004,heathersellshomes,9, Pixar out-did themselves with this one!,"Pixar's best yet! Humorous beyond my expectations, with Golden Rule principles to live by! I originally planned to sit this one out, but with a group activity decided to opt-in for the company. My expectation was that the movie would be about a bunch of has-been, out of shape super hero's, but in cartoon form (even worse!). I was pleasantly surprised at how easy to watch and entertaining the story actually was. There was no off-color humor that would be inappropriate for children. There were excellent family values being conveyed. And once again, the personalities and facial expressions were so life-like. If for no other reason, you must go see this movie for the animated short that precedes it. This is definitely fun for the family, and deserves to be a box-office smash!",
814,16 November 2004,hefdoherty,10, Fits in all the right places!,"Pixar's ""Incredibles"" is a deadly accurate homage to the James Bond/Superhero genre. I didn't expect much going in but I was very pleased going out. This movie fits in all the right places. Loved it, loved it! Now if they can't get EON productions to do Bond 21 as well.",

817,10 January 2005,NexNexus,5, Incredible... boooring,"I was waiting for 2 months to see this movie, and now I'm disappointed. Animation is great, as I expected, but the story is a disaster! If it was a 20 minutes long cartoon, it will be OK, but 100 minutes... This movie is predictable, characters are undeveloped, action scenes are boring and so on. And after watching previews and trailers and now the whole movie, I felt cheated. The movie does not deliver what they promised! I don't expect for every animation movie to be funny, but trailers made me to Believe this movie IS funny - which is not true. OK so The Incerdibles is not for kids? Great, animation movies for adults are my favorites! But this movie is not for adults at all! It is too shallow! Anyway, I gave it 5 out of 10.",
818,12 November 2004,ZCunha,10," Loved it, this is a movie for adults that kids will love.","Awesome. I gotta give credit to someone who totally caught the vibe of the superheros, Saturday morning cartoons, and the comic books we all grew up with. Primarily though, it was nice to have an animated film, (notice I'm not calling it a cartoon,) which didn't pull any punches, and didn't aim itself at kids. It was new, cool, and nostalgic all at the same time. Kudos to Pixar as well, for reintroducing the short at the beginning of the movie. Makes me want to dig out one of the old RPGs, and start running a supers campaign again.",
819,13 November 2004,merlinmagic,10, Excellent Film The Best Yet,"Loved this film. My son had been watching the trailers for a few months now and was looking forward to seeing it. As he is 3 I was concerned that he wouldn't sit through the film. Right from the outset this film captured his attention. The film is the best produced but Pixar in my opinion. My wife, son and myself enjoyed this film tremendously. I recommend this to any family looking for a film which offers good storyline and values. The voices and the animation are far superior to Finding Nemo. The characters are likable and ones you can relate to. Worthwhile spending you money on this film.",
820,14 November 2004,cole_yoakum,9, Ehh I would give it a 7...,"Very similar to the DC and Marvel Universes, but different enough to avoid lawsuits. Take your kids! I took my little sister who is 9 and she said she loved it. She wa the biggest fan of the costumes but was let down that the little bit with the belt wasn't in the actual movie, but was still happy with it overall.",
821,5 December 2004,logician1989,10," Reminds me of Alan Moore's ""Watchmen""","I enjoyed ""The Incredibles"" thoroughly. The plot was engaging, and the characters were well thought out and vividly portrayed, both in the animation and in the voice performances. The movie deals with complex and yes, realistic problems (e.g.: the frustrations of a husband and father sacrificing his personal aspirations and his sense of mission and purpose for the sake of providing a stable life for his family) in a nuanced and (despite the ""superhero"" element) believable way. The movie deserves high marks all around.",
822,13 December 2004,cengarle-1,9, doubtfully suitable for children,"Mr Parker writes ""there were moments where I found myself wondering if a little kid might be able to deal with the intensity of what was going on on screen"". Indeed, I went with my 7-yr-old boy and a 9-yr-old friend of him, and definitively: this is *not* a film for children. We were shocked at most by the scenes where the father (Mr Incredible) is being tortured and where the children (Violet and Dash) are attacked with machine-guns among other weapons. I'm sure I'd had enjoyed the film a lot if I wouldn't have gone with two kids. I find it disappointing when nobody warns one, and wanted hereby to let you know my experience and advise you to think it twice before going to The Incredibles with children.",
823,12 April 2019,mohamedghiaba400,10, best film,"Pixar's new title, we once more experience a great gratifying animation which deeps you inside by it's humorous and enthralling plot and keeps you laughing out loudly until the very end. Dreamworks' titles compared to Pixars are not too peculiar, but they seem to rip all their titles from Pixar and create a fake illusion of originality. Now that Pixar has created another chef-d'oeuvre, no doubt Dreamworks will once more rip the idea and create a title relating to",

The whole family all have different powers Mr incredible has super strength, Mrs Incredible has super stretch, Dash has Super Speed, Violet has invisibility, Jack Jack has all kind of different powers all haven't been explored and Frozone is a close friend who has Ice Powers.

832,30 September 2006,MattyHdot,8, Pure Fun,"I must say, when I heard Pixar was doing an original Super hero film, I had my doubts. But after I saw ""The Incredibles"", I was begging for a sequel. The movie starts out simply enough, Mr. Incredible fighting crime, and when he tries to stop someone from committing suicide, he gets sued for injuring said person which forces all super-powered people to go into hiding. Years later, Mr. Incredible has ""settled down"" and had a family... all of whom have superpowers too. One day, an old friend calls on him and creates him a new costume and is then sent on a mission. When his family finds out, they go after him, creating a team much like Marvel's Fantastic 4. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Pixar films and the Fantastic 4, you will love this movie!",

835,4 November 2004,meecha,9, Puts Spiderman To Shame!,"I saw ""The Incredibles"" last night at a Media Screening. This movie blows away a lot of the Superhero movies I've seen recently. As a mom I would first like to say that I don't think this movie should be seen by young children. Maybe I'm a little conservative but I would put the age for viewing this movie at about 8 years old. It is extremely fast paced with a lot of peril. I was even half covering my eyes at some points. The look of the movie is simply amazing. The whole time I was watching I could see the Video Game unfold before my eyes. The dialogue was quick and very witty with a wonderful heart warming family story. And of course my favorite character is the Superhero's costume designer ""Edna"" - Brad Bird is hilarious! This is a movie I would love to see again tomorrow! Hats off to PIXAR. Hope they stay with Disney. I think they are a great team!",
