0,5 September 2022,Xstal,9, Perpetually Outstanding...,"It's a story that's riven with themes, of prejudice, hate, broken dreams, there's courage and caring, there's taunting and daring, growing up, finding out what life means. At its heart you'll find Atticus Finch, defends a man most town folk want to lynch, no evidence in play, to support what they say, but they're adamant and won't move an inch. Scout and Jem watch these awful events, through child's eyes losing their innocence, in a world that's gone mad, it makes you so sad, but there's hope that leaves some recompense. Plus there's Boo, who defies more perceptions, all shrouded in cloaked misconceptions, hidden from view, most people eschew, but a saviour, and a child's revelation.",/
1,9 November 2003,FilmOtaku,10, One of the most important films of all time,"To Kill a Mockingbird is the movie based on the Harper Lee novel of the same name about Scout, Jem and their father, Atticus Finch who is an attorney in a small southern town.  It is both a coming of age story about the children as well as a hard-hitting drama, as Atticus defends a black man who is on trial for the rape of a white woman.  ",r
2,1 April 2004,clydestuff,10," Not just film, but film history","The first time I saw To Kill A Mockingbird was at a drive-in theater.  I was probably about ten or eleven at the time.  Even at a young age I was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children that I could easily relate to.  Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley, held a kind of mystery and an eeriness for me, much in the way a ghost story would.  I'm not about to make the pretense that I understood the social significance of To Kill A Mockingbird at the age of ten, or even the greatness of the film.  That would come later in life, after having viewed it in one of it's first network television broadcasts.",e
3,4 September 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, Amazing film,"After hearing nothing but critical acclaim for this film, and the book it was based on, I finally got to see it. I am quite amazed at how well done this film is, and how timeless the theme is. I haven't read the book, but I'm considering it, just to see if there are any details that were left out. The story is amazing and exceptionally told. As far as I know, the film is as close to the book as it could possibly be; some call it the most accurate book-to-film conversion ever. The plot is very good, it takes a timeless problem and presents it to us, through the innocent eyes of a naive child. The pace is very good; apart from The Godfather(the first one) and one or two other exceptions, this is the only drama where there was truly not one single moment that I found dull, boring or unimportant. Nothing seemed trivial in the film. The perspective that is forced upon us is that of a young child, naive and innocent. This is a brilliant idea, as the eyes of a child is without a doubt one of the most impressionable things in the world, and the film handles this perfectly. What really makes the film, apart from the brilliant and possibly unique perspective, is the fact that the children are likable, credible and charming. You couldn't help but like them; believe me, normally I really dislike children. I find them annoying, loud and egotistical. But with this film, I couldn't, for one second, muster up any tiny amount of aggression, or even annoyance. They come off as so likable, charming, and, most importantly, *real*. Almost every kid in any Hollywood movie is either a completely ridiculous stereotype/cliché of a brat, who does nothing but destroy things around him, or the exact opposite, a little angel. Everyone knows that no child is the latter all the time, and even I will admit that there probably doesn't exist too many children who are the first, either. In this film, the children are completely real. They are naive, innocent, they disobey what their father tells them, but ultimately, they obviously love and respect their father, and they never do anything, anything at all, with the intent to hurt or harm someone or something. That is what a child is; innocent. They do what they do because they do not know better. This film provides a perfect view into their world, or, rather, their perspective of it. The acting is excellent. The child actors exceed all expectations. I was amazed at how professional and convincing they were. The other actors all give great performances as well. The cinematography is excellent; once again, it gives a perfect perspective on what your surroundings look like when you're a child. The characters are well-written, credible and well-casted. The dialog was well-written. The script was excellent. A very memorable and beautiful film, should be viewed by almost anyone. I recommend this to anyone who likes dramas, and just about anyone who for one reason or another might enjoy this. Don't be scared off by it being over forty years old, or it being black and white; it's an excellent film, and just about anyone would enjoy it. Don't miss this perfect film. 10/10",v
4,30 March 1999,Don-102,9, Wonderful Social Classic That Echoes Issues of Its Day...,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is presented like a play in three acts. It is also from the children's perspective. Through the kids, we find that racism is a learned attitude or feeling. We also see a delightful coming of age drama as the young kids realize that there is no Boogeyman down the street and their father is capable of doing a lot more than they think. The great Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, a pillar of nobility, social conscience, and, rare for 1930's Americana, a single parent. Peck is such a strong presence, you believe everything about him. It is something you can compare to America's trust in TV anchorman Walter Cronkite. We always took his word for it.",i
5,27 January 2006,bkoganbing,10, Our Greatest Film Hero,"When the American Film Institute polled its members and they selected Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch as the greatest hero on film ever, the selection was met with very few dissenters. I'm sure not going to argue the merits of the choice. But I do have a theory as to why.",e
6,15 December 1998,HenryHextonEsq,9, It does the book justice.,"After studying the outstanding book of To Kill A Mockingbird at school, I viewed this film, and was on the whole very impressed. Scout and Jem are portrayed brilliantly, considering the ages of the children who played them, and they, as with everything else in the production, are true to the book's spirit. Gregory Peck is perfect as the unflappable Atticus Finch, and deserved his Oscar. The music is worthy of praise, especially for the climatic scene, and the raw emotion and feeling of the book is amply conveyed. All of the cast are well cast, and it's interesting to ponder how much this film, at the time, would've shocked. That the book explores racism and outsiders in a southern town, through the eyes of a child is genius and works very nicely here. The only problems are minor- much of the book's counter-balancing humour was left out, certain characters are omitted (Dolphus Raymond and Aunt Alexandra), and some of the book's early characterisation is missed. Aside from these gripes, this is a magical film and a ""must-see,"" as a companion piece to the classic novel. 9/10",w

8,20 October 2002,lizziebeth-1,10, Every bit as good as they say (B&W). Still POWERFUL. 10/10. Spoilers.,"Horton Foote's Oscar-winning screenplay is so good, it really supplants the 1960 Harper Lee book. I've recently re-read the novel, and it seemed weighed down and paced with backwoods vernacular and situations right out of the 1930s, that are shockingly removed from the 21st century. My goodness. I hope it doesn't strike others so, because the book is a gem too. It's just in need of ...updating perhaps, which is what the 1962 movie excels at; it translates the Depression Era for us. The characters (played, eg by Gregory Peck and Brock Peters in their signature roles) seem so much better-depicted on screen than merely in my own imagination from having read the book!",r
9,11 May 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, An important and enduring cry against prejudice in all its forms.,"'To Kill A Mockingbird (1962)' has held up remarkably well over the years, perhaps most due to its faithful representation of Harper Lee's timeless source novel. It boasts brilliant performances - including surprisingly good turns from the first-time child actors - and beautifully crisp black-and-white cinematography. While the movie isn't quite as successful as the book, as usually is the case, it's still an enjoyable tale that acts as an important and enduring cry against prejudice in all its forms. 8/10",w
10,11 April 2002,jam5219,10, enough can't be said,"Enough good things can't be said about this movie.  It is undoubtedly one of the best and most moving films ever made.  No other racial injustice or discriminatory based movie can even compare with ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". This movie not only makes you sympathize with those who were being discriminated against, but also those who fought for those people.  One of the most moving parts of the movie is when Atticus Finch is leaving the court room and Reverend Sykes tells Scout to ""stand up your father is passing"".",1

12,22 February 2014,SnoopyStyle,10, American Classic,"Based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning book, Scout (Mary Badham) is a 6 year old girl living in Maycomb, Alabama during the 1930s. It's a tired old town life with his lawyer father Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and his little brother Jem.

13,10 August 2017,HotToastyRag,7, 'Do you know what a compromise is?',"To Kill a Mockingbird is pretty famous in my household. My mom loved Gregory Peck's portrayal of the integrity-filled, honest, caring, patient father so much that she named my brother Atticus. It was a running quotation when I was growing up to say, ""Do you know what a compromise is?"" with a little Southern drawl. I know my family is one of millions who have tried to emulate Gregory Peck's clipped pronunciation of ""Scout""; that one word is another one of our famous and long-running movie quotations.",8
14,30 July 2014,Hitchcoc,10, When a Book and a Movie Knock It Out of the Park,"There is something so sensitive yet intense in Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch. He is a man of great honor and true humanity. He takes it all inside, dealing with the realities of what he is facing. He ignore the threats and sees a man for a man. However, he is doomed but represents an action out of time. I was especially impressed with the children in this movie. They are not scene stealers but rather show the future if allowed to grow up. As the trial moves along, it is obvious that there is little that can be said to counteract the hate that is there. But like most of us, Atticus and look in the mirror at the end of the day and say he did what was right. Gregory Peck was a top ten actor and wandered smoothly from movies such as ""Moby Dick"" to ""The Omen."" He was masterful in psychological thrillers such as ""Spellbound."" This was, however, his finest hour. The man with the rumpled suit and the big heart.",6

It is a perfect portrayal of childhood innocence, racial prejudice, moral tolerance and courage. No other words can describe this film except marvellous.

17,19 August 2018,sddavis63,9, Superb Performance By Gregory Peck; Superb Directing By Robert Mulligan,"In my experience, this may be the best adaptation of a novel that Hollywood has ever produced, the story having been taken from the novel of the same name by Harper Lee. It's a story about racism in the Depression-era South. It's a coming of age story for young Scout and Jem, who watch their father Atticus doggedly defend a black man accused of beating and raping a young white woman. It features magnificent performances from pretty much the entire cast. Young Mary Badham was actually nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Scout - but then, perhaps surprisingly, she went on to do very little acting. And what can one say about Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. This may well have been his best performance; when I think of Gregory Peck it's certainly Atticus Finch who comes into my mind. There's an incredible mix of well known names in the supporting cast: Brock Peters, William Windom, Paul Fix and even a very young Robert Duvall. And there really isn't a weak performance among them. Most of the attention around ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is usually focused on the performances, and especially Peck, but I want to pay special tribute to the directing.",/
18,11 May 2005,elliexphant,10," An utterly moving film, made perfect by the outstanding performance of Gregory Peck. Must see","'To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of the best books ever written but this film does it justice. The performances throughout are stunning, especially that of Gregory Peck (Harper Lee was so impressed she gave him her late father's pocket watch, a prop he uses in the film, to keep). This film will make anyone think hard about how they treat others and it is really heartwarming without being soppy. It isn't necessary to have read the book before seeing this film but it might be advisable. This is one of the classic films of its generation and very few films of nowadays come close to matching it either. A real must-see.",?
19,12 May 2006,kenjha,6, This bird don't sing,"This much-praised movie is about a lawyer and his children living in a racially divisive South in the 1930s. Although the central theme concerns the lawyer defending a black man accused of raping a white woman, much of the film is devoted to the exploits of the children as they play games and make trouble. Therein lies the problem. Watching the children at play is only mildly interesting. The focus shifts to the rape trial for a while and then its back to the children and a weird neighbor (Duvall), who seems to be from another movie. The film is poorly constructed, lacking focus. Peck is good as Finch, who is portrayed as a decent fellow but certainly not the greatest hero in American cinema as AFI would have us believe. Considering its reputation, a very disappointing film.",r
20,19 July 2001,telegonus,7, The Old Gray Bird Ain't What She Used To Be,"One hates to be the skunk at the garden party but this movie simply isn't as good as its reputation might suggest. It is extremely dated and calculated in ways that are now obvious but probably worked back in 1962. The dialogue has a tendency to go on for too long in almost every scene, as points are hammered home continuously, didactically, but aside from the scenes that belong only to the children the film is dramatically leaden and top heavy in what were at the time 'dangerous' and 'radical' ideas about racism and injustice (though they were fashionable in Hollywood), and frequently the movie feels like a sermon, and a self-congratulatory one at that.",e
21,7 March 2005,shan_seehar-1,10, A Remarkably Simple and Simply Remarkable Masterpiece!,"Very rarely, it happens that movies are made that are very simple in expression but possess monumental appeals and significant life lessons in a style only of the kind of their own that, we can't expect even. This fact is truthfully exemplified in this movie. It's not just a movie or even just a promising story in general, but all it portray's is ""Innocence"". A girl's recollection of her childhood days which are still at their full bloom in her mind, depicting the innocence of juvenile as well as as adult minds, a period where mostly immature minds become curious to the racial bigotry and sometimes mature minds become its prey and a time when harsh realities of life like intolerance, hatreds, prejudice and adversities of society gradually dawn upon them.",f

23,12 March 2017,Bored_Dragon,10, What kind of a man are you?,"I do not want to analyze this film. It seems like a desecration. It is enough to say that the American Film Institute declared Atticus Finch the number one on the list of greatest movie heroes of all times, and that Mary Badham was nominated for Oscar for the role of Scout, when she was only 10 years old. This is one of those movies where one watching is enough to remember them for the rest of your life.",=
24,28 February 2017,zkonedog,9," True To Its Source, While Also Adding Some Iconic Canon","When judging a film based on a spectacularly popular novel, there are two things that I usually look for: 1. Does it stick to the compelling themes of the source material reasonably well? I don't need word-for-word and I don't even mind little changes here and there, but it should be faithful to the themes that made the literature iconic. 2. Does it add something unique to the equation? Print literature and film are too entirely different beasts to tame (just ask Stephen King about that!), and one doesn't necessarily (or even usually) translate well into the other. In essence, you can't just expect a movie to be successful because the book was likewise. The film-makers need to make sure the translation is fit for the big screen.",t

26,20 June 2020,bill-25659,10, A Clear and Uncluttered Eye,"Equal parts heartwarming and heartrending, this is one of the tiny number of films that is hard to overpraise. Deep south depression-era prejudice is filtered clear and uncluttered through the eyes of white children. I watched this again on Juneteenth and its quiet, gentle impact is devastating. Peck is wonderful, of course, but the kids are incredible. Every scene is crafted by Robert Mulligan with creativity and realism. The final 20 minutes flip from harrowing to something that feels like prayer. If you saw this as a kid in 1962, you watched the story unfold with an innocent eye. As a grownup in 2020, and certainly if you have kids of your own, you'll be an emotional wreck halfway through. The film is every bit as satisfying as the book.",_
27,5 October 2020,andrewroy-04316,7, A solid adaptation of a classic,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a tricky adaptation, because as with many great books, it delves deeply into several different topics and themes. Condensing the plot and themes into the shorter timeframe of a movie is always challenging, and while they definitely pull it off successfully here, I do think we see a bit more breadth than depth. They did cut several plot points and scenes which were less essential, which was necessary. Even so, we don't get to know the characters and the nuances of their relationships as much as I would like here. The movie is less about the nuanced characters and themes that the book focuses on and simply tells the compelling story of a murder trial of an innocent black man in old money Alabama. It's still well done and I enjoyed it, but one of my favorite elements of the book was seeing the world from Scout's point of view and understanding her perspective as a precocious young woman in that society. We still get a general sense of her character, but don't see as much about her relationship with Jim and how it evolves, or see much development from her across the film. We do spend plenty of time in the courtroom to understand fully what is happening in the case. It's hard to fault the writers too much, and the safe call is definitely prioritizing storytelling as they did, but as a result no other elements stood out or grabbed me. I did also find that the writing suffered a bit from a problem I also had with the novel: that the story feels a bit segmented, with a few sections that don't flow naturally into each other. Still, these are fairly minor qualms and it is a rock solid adaptation of a good story.",u
28,14 December 2014,ironhorse_iv,9," Atticus Finch will be there all night, and he would still be there when Jem waked up in the morning. To kill a Mockingbird is a masterpiece.","I remember reading the source material for the movie, the Putizer Reward book of the same name by Harper Ferry when in middle school. The film removes a few sub-plots, but still, very faithful to the book. It's still long with a few boring moments, but whenever, the character of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) got on screen, it was a joy to watch. This is Peck's best role. A lot of people might remember, this film for the court-room drama, as Atticus Finch find himself defending a black man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) accused of rape, but the movie directed by Robert Mulligan and written by Horton Foote; is also a coming to age story, teaching tolerance and decry prejudice. Without spoiling too much, the story covers three years of the 1930s, showing Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch (Mary Badham) and her brother Jem (Phillip Alford), undergo big changes in their young lives. I like how Atticus Finch help them on the way, being a good father figure. As a Southern Gothic and a Bildungsroman, the primary themes of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. You also see the movie dig deep into the issues of class, just/unjust laws, and Southern morals. A lot of woman believe it, touch on women's rights. I can see it. The patriarchal South does have a history that kinda made white men the dominant group, and women and blacks deemed in more subordinate roles. A lot of LGBT supporters believe that the book is gay or lesbian ""coming-of-age"" tale. Indeed, the movie dealt with gender roles in the American Deep South. Scout does acts more like a tom boy and show more a masculine side that feminine. She does not respond positively to anything girly, but it's really hard to prove that she is a closed lesbian or not due to the age. Scout hasn't reach adolescence yet. If Scout was based on Harper Lee's childhood, we still wouldn't know because Lee was an extremely private person and there is little information on her even in major biography databases. It's hard to prove, if Harper Lee is gay or not. Others people have look at this theory, by using Dill as an example, because Dill was supposed based on Harper Lee's childhood friend, the openly gay Truman Capote. While, there is no clear evidence supporting this, other than the fact that Capote was a childhood friend of Harper Lee. I really don't really know. After all, Lee, in turn, is the model for the Idabel character in Capote's first novel, 'Other Voices, Other Rooms,' which seem more like a heterosexual heroine. While, Dill and Scout seem to have a somewhat romantic relationship during childhood, who knows where their sexuality lies. A lot could change if a sequel to the book was ever written, which Harper Lee most likely, will not do. She hasn't wrote a book in years. This issue also brings the rumors of authorship. Some people believe it was written by Truman Capote; while others believe Harper Lee wrote Capote's best novel, In Cold Blood. Who knows? One thing for sure, is the plot is based on the unsuccessful legal defense by Harper Lee's attorney father, during the 1931 landmark Scottsboro Boys interracial rape case. The movie has a lot of heart & humor, despite dealing with dark themes. The film is widely considered to be one of the greatest films ever made. The film won three Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Peck. In 1995, To Kill a Mockingbird was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant'. Still, some people might hate this film. After all, it has a scene where Atticus shoots a mad dog. Some people see that scene, as he basically is a hypocrite, because he just killed a mockingbird; because Tim Johnson wasn't doing anything it was literally standing there. It wasn't charging at him or the kids. I can see where they are coming from, but the dog was suffering. I know PETA wouldn't like that, but it had a lot of symbolism with the dog scene. Perhaps, it's just one of examples of Atticus doing tough things he doesn't want to do. Is rabies supposed to represented racism? Atticus does refer to racism as ""Maycomb's usual disease."" In addition, while Atticus does not protect the children against racism, he does shoot down racism. Is the dog shooting, an allegory? Is it saying black people are dogs? Is the film saying it's alright to kill black people if they're suffering? Who knows? Maybe, I'm oversimplification it. Perhaps it's just the feeling Scout has. The sick horror at what's happening in front of her and how over complex, violent can be. Was this scene, needed? Maybe- not. Despite its good themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets. The film does stereotyped blacks as superstitious, poor, and poorly education blacks who to some critics believe were ""contented slaves"". Some criticized the movie for focusing less on the blacks, and more on the story how honest, white man save them for racism. Surprising, there is some truth to that in the film, but the white savior narrative in film since this movie had indeed, went a little overboard. I didn't mind it, too much in this film. In recent years this idealization of Atticus Finch has been challenged. He is accused of having an élitist and paternalistic attitude towards his client and women, while some have asked how this ""father-knows-best"" could have so casually overlooked the Depression South's appalling record of racism, sexism and class exploitation. Still, there is no greater good guy than Atticus Finch in my opinion. Atticus Finch served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. Overall: It's a must watch.",r

One of the main reasons that I purchased the film was to see Ruth White in her performance as miserable Mrs. Dubose. Sadly she had a much bigger role in the novel but for everybody involved in this film classic, it was worth any minute of time. Alice Ghostley is also in the film as one of the mother and neighbor.

34,10 June 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9," Beautifully shot, moving and faithful to the book","To start with, the book is absolutely wonderful with great characters and a moving story. To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best adaptations of a book, it is not only faithful to the source material but it almost improves on it. Do I have any criticisms? Not really, other than to say that the film is a tad overlong for my liking. But it is a brilliant film, with a beautifully crafted story that still maintains the emotional punch of the book about a lawyer in the Deep South and the effect of the rape trial on his children. The film is beautifully shot, the whole film is incredible to watch, and the score is sensitive. The script is effective and sticks closely to the book, and the direction from Robert Mulligan is very impressive. The acting is really good, I have read that Henry Fonda would have been better for Atticus Finch, although Fonda was a great actor, Gregory Peck does give a superb and career-best performance in this film. And he is very well supported by an excellent Robert Duvall as disturbed Boo Radley, while Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are very well-cast as the children. Overall, a wonderful and faithful adaptation and just an excellent film really. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",

Being younger than the film itself, I can only imagine the impact it had on people when it first came out. And seeing how the film has not been forgotten after the decades since it's release, I think it's safe to say that it had quite an effect as it continues to do so.

The whole rape trial sequence seems overly preachy to me now. I suppose that in the early '60's there may have been people unaware of the realities of Jim Crow, but nowadays it has been forced down everyone's throat for decades.

64,30 March 2002,castricv,4," Fine child acting, poor direction and story. Extremely Overrated.","Before I start my explanation of the above statements, I would like to comment that I am an avid Gregory Peck fan and I have also found his work to be of exceptional quality. This movie is no exception. I have also read Harper Lee's novel of the same name and found it to succeed in every area and every issue that it was trying to portray. Unfortunately, this success did not transfer to film, even with Mr. Peck and a cast of exceptionally talented child-actors. Every aspect of the film, with the exception of Mr. Peck and the children, is lacking, misguided, and often tries to pull at the heartstrings of early 1960's viewers with lame set-ups and other devices used to show one side and one man as being absolutely unerring and without vice. The movie takes a while to develop and for the first half-hour focuses primarily on the children. The children do rather everyday things and converse with each other about nothing of consequence on the film. They finally decide to explore a ""haunted house"" to see the ""maniac"" that lives within it. While I felt that this avenue might lead somewhere, nothing of any consequence, albeit a small meeting with the maniac at the end of the film, came of this rather long and drawn out plot line. Next, we see that Mr. Peck, who portrays a compassionate, strong father and lawyer, is assigned to defend a black man who has supposedly committed a rape of a white female. Subsequent to this, there is never any conversation among Peck and the defendant, no evidence discussed prior to trial, and no real character development of the defendant and even to a larger extent Mr. Peck. We then see a few scattered scenes of the ultra-racist and completely ignorant father-of-the-victim, who tries his best to cause trouble and say dirty things to black people. Though he is shown as mean and stupid, he doesn't do anything particularly characteristic of an enraged racist father, he merely calls Mr. Peck a ""ni$%er lover "" and spits a lot. You will notice that he is not even with the angry mob that tells Mr. Peck to hand over the prisoner so that they can lynch him. Finally, we arrive at a trial, where it is unbelievable that this case would have even gone to trial based on certain obvious fact that you will see in the movie. In trying to say any more directly involving the film's plot, I would be spoiling the movie for you, but suffice it to say, if Mr. Peck were not in this film and did not give such a rousing courtroom speech, this movie would have been forgotten long ago. The direction is poor and uneven, plot tangents go untouched or under-developed, and many of the characters and actors seem rather silly. Instead of achieving what the book did in terms of portraying racism in the Depression South and the intriguing stories of the children, the film manages to seem poorly done, even cheap, and the child actors's obvious talents go to waste on dead end plot lines. Even the costuming seems badly done. You will notice that all of the whites wear overalls, while the ""enlightened"" Mr. Peck and a handful of kind blacks wear suits. In closing instead of being a thoughtful and poignant depiction of racism in the South, it seems contrived. My recommendation is to avoid this unless you are an avid Gregory Peck fan and read the novel. But if you really want to watch a movie close to this subject that is done well, try In the Heat of the Night or any number of Sidney Portier's films. 4/10",

He's a loving single parent who tries to instill values into his two children, Jem (Philip Alford) and his younger sister ""Scout"" (Mary Badham). The story is told as a flashback from the perspective of a now-grown Scout (who narrates) during one memorable summer in her youth where her father elected to defend a Negro farmhand named Tom Robinson (Brock Peters). At a time when black people were not well respected in small southern towns, Finch stands alone in his plight to help the innocent young man who has been wrongly accused of raping and beating a white woman. Brock Peters is highly sympathetic as the good-natured Robinson during an unfair courtroom trial, with Gregory Peck as his well-meaning attorney with the odds stacked against him. Fine acting also by young Alford and especially Badham as the children learning about bigotry through their dad in addition to the ongoing trial.

The important point is that in the Deep South in the '30s, it was unheard of (not to mention dangerous) for a white man to defend a black man. But the story is told from the point of view of his daughter Scout (Mary Badham), who gets taunted at school; everyone tells her that her daddy defends (N-words).

Gregory Peck really deserved his Oscar for th role of Atticus Finch; his dignified portrayal of a single father called upon to ""do our unpleseant jobs for us"" is remarkable.  Not only is he wonderful and eloquent in the courtroom scenes, but his scenes at home are wonderful, too. He seems to be every child's image of the ideal father: stern yet kind, all-knowing, able to explain anything, and yet his kids know he can't do everything, though he can do more than they think.  These scenes also give him a chance to interact with the amazing child actors Mary Badham and Philip Alford, both of whom had never done any acting before this and yet are naturals.  Badham is espicially good in the scenes where she and Atticus discuss things; she senses so much, and yet is still so innocent.  She does a lot of growing up, but so does Alford, as he listens in on his father's talks with the judge and watches his visits to the Robinson home.  His maturing is much easier to see.  Both actors are just as good as Peck; their adventures are amusing and their performances excellent.  Brock Peters is also very good as Tom Robinson, the black man accused of raping a white woman.  You are not manipulated into feeling sorry for him; you just naturally are, thanks to his portrayal and the direction of his scenes. This is a wonderful movie.

It's all perfect. Well, ... almost. The only thing I always found weird, when I first saw the film 25 years ago and still today, is the unnatural silence and discipline in the courthouse.

What a relief, nay, what a JOY to find that this film has, if anything, grown in stature moving me once again to tears. Having always admired Gregory Peck and been bemused by how underrated he was I was delighted when this magisterial performance was rewarded with an Oscar, one that he could have picked up for Twelve O'Clock High, The Gunfighter, Roman Holiday and post-Mockingbird Captain Newman, MD. Like Jack Lemmon and Alan Ladd - who, it has to be said, was an actor with a limited range - Peck embodied decency so that in many ways Atticus Finch, the father everybody wishes he had and/or SHOULD have had, WAS Gregory Peck in period costume. Like all great films the strength begins with the writing and here a perfect novel that belongs up there with The Great Gatsby becomes a perfect film, transposed from one medium to another with great finesse by Horton Foote. Not since Mickey Rooney learned the major lessons of life at the knee of Judge Hardy in another small town has moral education been so easy to take; it's difficult if not impossible to find anything negative to say about this masterpiece which glitters and gleams from the opening credits and first bars of its haunting theme.

90,30 January 2014,silva-w-pius,8, sweet and tender,"Arguably the strongest bond of any relationship between two human begins, more than; the husband and wife, more than two sister and even more than a mother and her daughter. The strongest of all bonds is the one shared between a father and his son. The father being the mentor, whose job it is to help his son, to guide his son through the unsteady, turbulent and sometimes painful sea that is life. His kind words of encouragements must act as sails boats to guide us into man hood. Well Mockingbird is not strictly just a father and son relationship, there is also a daughter added to the mix, but despite that, Atticus Finch is the perfect illustration of what a good father should be as with stern love and mostly importantly education, he teaches his children to love in a world full of hate, and for me that's the greatest lesson any father could teach his children. And To Kill a Mockingbird is the perfect illustration of a true American classic. Based on the Pulitzer-Prize winning masterpiece novel by Harper Lee (Her only novel), writer Horton Foote and director Robert Mulligan, ingeniously guide us through a painful period in human history for all those involved, a period of economic turmoil and the very apex of racial tension in the deep south, Maycomb, Alabama, in 1932 to be more precise. But what makes the film the even more compelling is how we are shown a world filled with so much ugly, but at the same time we are lead to a single red rose of beauty, because we are shown the world through the eyes of 6 year old girl called Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch (Mary Badham) a high spirited and precocious young girl, who despite her innocent smile, you certainly don't want to find yourself on her bad side. On her journey she is accompanied by Brother Jeremy Atticus ""Jem"" Finch (Phillip Alford), neighbourhood friend Dill Harris and last but not least farther Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. But it's through Scouts eyes we see her father a nigh-on perfect, eloquent and intelligent lawyer seeks to uphold what is true and just, in a world that seeks to abuse and belittle a whole race of people, as he puts it upon himself to protect a black man in court against the bigoted arm of injustice. The black man is Tom Robinson and he has been accused of raping a poor white girl named Mayella Violet Ewell, but as you would expect in 1932, an all white jury sees him as guilty even though the film consistently paints him a positive light, suggesting he is innocent. Despite this, Atticus still endeavours to protect a man he firmly believes is innocent, leading to one of the most impressive and compelling (and longest) courtroom scenes in history. The two things that stood out to me the most was, for one Gregory Peck performance as the father, which I felt he defiantly deserved his Best Actors Oscar for his performance, because as many times as I watch the film back I can't help but fall in love with it again and again, because peck is able to take a onion layered character who one point his a pacifists, loving father, then a second later he shots down a dog 100 meters away with just one bullet, as if he was in a Clint Eastwood film. And it's this ability to take such a complex character, with so such juxtapositions at his core, and be able to do Harper Lee's character a great service with a gentle, controlled and fine paint brush flick from a true artist. The second thing that stood out for me was the three young actors who made the film such an enjoyable and funny watch, each brought passion and enthusiasm to the role, which helped Foote's script truly come alive. Ranked 33rd greatest American film for a reason! An intoxicating watch, I strongly recommended it as viewing for all occasion.",

Perhaps that's because the picture hooks us with it's courtroom drama and the overt issue of racial intolerance in 1930's America. Maybe it's because Gregory Peck is so brilliant in the role of the hero that it's easy to overlook all of the supporting characters. In any event, this is a strong and stirring film, I consider it must viewing for any serious fan of great cinema. It is simply perfect in it's execution, with character portrayals that are as real and endearing as any in film.",

93,20 February 2008,tavm,10, To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the greatest movie experiences ever,"In commenting on African-Americans in film in chronological order for Black History Month, we're now at 1962 with the release of the movie version of Harper Lee's novel, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". The crux of the story is lawyer Atticus Finch's (Oscar-winning performance of Gregory Peck) defending black farmer Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) against the testimony of Mayella's (Collin Wilcox Paxton) accusation of her rape by him. These scenes are some of the most touching and intense I've ever seen of a movie made while there was still a Production Code in effect (though the rules of that Code were relaxed by this time compared to the '30s and '40s). Peters' testimony and, especially, Peck's closing statement were especially touching. Since we're talking about black performers, here's a few more I'd like to mention from this movie: Estelle Evans as Peck's housekeeper for his kids-this actress is the sister of Esther Rolle from ""Good Times"", David Crawford as Tom's son David, Jester Hairston-who I remember from ""Amen""-as Tom's father Spence, Kim Hamilton as Tom's wife Helen, and Bill Walker as the Rev. Sykes who says perhaps the most famous line in the movie, ""Miss Jean Louise, stand up, your father is passing."" (I had earlier misquoted this line in a review of the ""Our Gang"" comedy, Young Sherlocks, which starred his wife, Peggy Cartwright, as a child) Others in the cast are Kim Stanley who's Scout as an adult in narration, Alice Ghostley and William Windon in their film debuts, and, as the children, John Megna-brother of Connie Stevens-as neighbor boy Dill, Philip Alford as Finch's son Jem, and Mary Badham-whose brother John would become a movie director-as Finch's daughter Jean Louise, better known as ""Scout"". Then there's Robert Duvall in his scene stealing turn as the silent Boo Radley. What else can I say about this movie produced by Alan J. Pakula, directed by Robert Mulligan, with screenplay adapted by Horton Foote except this is one of the best ever made in my lifetime! Everyone I've just mentioned was just superb and the score by Elmer Bernstein was a most wonderful addition to this great movie from 1962. Kudos to Ms. Lee for the only novel she ever published that turned out to be one of the most exhilarating movie experiences I've ever had. So on that note, I definitely recommend To Kill a Mockingbird.",

However ..it is what it is..and this is a very highly rated movie by a lot of people. It does seem a little pointless to let a man ""get away with murder"" at the end of the movie..while the rest of the film..is all about how justice is required by society..no matter what.

I read it freshman year of high school and immediately fell in love with the story and the characters. We were meant to watch the movie after reading the book, but we didn't get around to it, and at the time, I was glad. At the time, my experience had led me to believe that movie adaptations of good books are rarely good enough to live up to my expectations, and nearly 10 years later, I still believe that when it comes to most books. But after having to watch this movie in a film class in college, I was forced to admit that this is not always the case. This movie is flawless. It perfectly captures the tone and spirit of the book, the casting was absolutely perfect, the score is amazing and well timed, the emotions are real and vivid. This deserves all the accolades it gets and many many more. I only wish I had seen it earlier. While the book continues to be something I come back to time and time again, this is a rare case when I actually feel comfortable watching the movie instead of rereading the book if I want to save time. It's (almost) just as good. It certainly comes closer than any other movie ever did to capturing the subtle perfection of a novel.

It shows us, through the eyes of imaginative and energetic children, what life was like.

Mr. Peck helps his children maneuver the fear and prejudice that grips us on the verge of adulthood. The prosecution of Tom Robinson, which has become a cliché, is often given as the film's basic plot; but, this is a serious miscalculation as this much more than a courtroom drama.

110,4 September 2015,Robert_duder,10, The sheer definition of a classic and possibly the most important film ever made,"I'm not the only reviewer to state how important this film is. I have seen it before but its been years. I fell in love with the book when I read it in High School and the film is probably one of, if not thee, most beloved adaptations to film ever made and its easy to see why. The same heart and soul that brings the book to life comes through in the film equally and that is no easy feat. Its a coming of age film, but its also a film completely and utterly indicative of its time and locale. You're not watching a movie, you are completely involved in this little town and in the Finch family. You are standing right there with Scout and Jem and you are in silent awe of the powerful and yet subtle man that is Atticus Finch. Gregory Peck was likely born to play this role as was several of the other characters. The film is so mysterious in the way they approach Boo Radley that you are literally a kid on the street with them anxious and curious about Radley. For whatever reason we don't see the accused Tom Robinson until well through halfway the film. Despite being black and white, there is something vibrant and completely powerful about the setting of the film. And the closing battle in the courtroom is easily one of the most awe inspiring scenes in cinema history period.",
111,16 May 2016,CriticalViewing,7, Stayed true to the book!,"Director Mulligan did a really good job of keeping true to the book of which this film is based, that was released only a short 2 years prior. Through brilliant framing, subjective pov, and long takes that often included monologues; this told and showed the story that has been a staple in America's history. It was highly culturally significant when it was penned, and it remains something that we look at today, because it dealt with more than just race, but also the stereotypes we place on people and how those are usually wrong (easily seen in Boo Radley's case). The film shows strength, cruelty, bravery in all of the everyday ways in which it as experienced, and that teaching doesn't end at with youth. That the student can just as easily learn, and then become the teacher. The best example is Atticus to his daughter Scout, who then speaks to Mr. Cunnighamn. She does so calmly and casually; she reminds him who he is when he isn't filled with hate and rage, and that her and her family are people just like him, reminding him that his son goes to school with her and of her father saying ""thank you"" after an act of surprise kindness he had done a while ago. She learns and grows throughout this experience, and is the vehicle through which the learning curve can be taught and seen to an audience that would have been conflicted during those times (the 1960s).",

114,29 January 2015,barryrd,9, Small town attorney fights bigotry,"An outstanding movie with Gregory Peck, To Kill a Mockingbird is based on the Harper Lee novel set during the Depression of the 1930's. While it has a strong civil rights message that is the core of the film, it is also a great family story. This comes out early in the film as Jem and Scout, Peck's two children, meet up with Dill, the boy staying next door for the summer. It is a small town where children play and explore the neighbourhood. We see a mad dog that Atticus shoots to spare his family from any attack and a house that the neighbours avoid out of fear of what lies within it. Mary Badham and Philip Alford are Scout and Jem, the two children of Atticus Finch. Atticus is a single father and a lawyer whose wife died several years earlier. Atticus spends time with his children and answers their questions in an honest and loving way. When a judge comes by to ask him to take on a case of alleged assault by a black man, Atticus knows he will be taking on a huge burden in a town where blacks are up against bigotry and ignorance. Yet, he agrees right off. No discussion with a judge...just a simple yes to the judge's question. It is clear that the accused black man is innocent but justice for blacks does not come easily with the climate in this town. During the trial, all the black people look down from the balcony above in the segregated courtroom, symbolic of their distance from laws that govern them. At the end of the trial, they all stand in unison when Atticus leaves. Atticus is a great role model for his community, a lawyer and parent who raises his children and fights for justice in his own town. There is a lesson in how to be a good neighbour toward the end that puts an end to a neighbourhood fallacy. This is one very moving and inspiring film and a great achievement for director Robert Mulligan (Up the Down Staircase, Love with a Proper Stranger).",

It went on too long and the first half was really just a kids' movie, told from their perspective and about their adventures. I didn't care for the ending either. I rate this film a 4/10. Moreover, it's a poorly developed story in that all the black characters are just noble statues to be used as props while not actually interacted with, and the white townsfolk are all bigoted racists with the exception of Atticus the great white savior for the blacks. It's actually a racist story against both blacks and whites because of this profiling and treatment of the characters.

First is the daily lives of some perky children in a small town, and the second is a lawsuit of a black man who is accused of raping a white woman. Hence the second one is a very serious subject that still preserves its popularity today. In my opinion, the narrative of the second one could have been elaborated more delicately. For example, when a lot of men came to bust the jail which was guarded only by Atticus, I wonder how he would have dealt with the situation if the children hadn't showed up to interfere in the midnight.

Also, I wonder why Atticus Finch was voted number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains instead of James Bond or Indiana Jones, he didn't do much heroic stuff. Anyway, basically Atticus (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Gregory Peck) lives with his maid and two kids Jean Louise 'Scout' (Oscar nominated Mary Badham) and Jeremy 'Jem' Finch (Phillip Alford). All I can say about the court case, which comes a lot later, is that Atticus tries quite hard, but he doesn't win the case to prove a Negroes innocence of raping a woman. The stories that I really am interested in involve the two kids and their new friend, Charles Baker 'Dill' Harris (John Megna) nearly investigating a psychopathic neighbourhood man, but later, you find out he is nothing like what they expected, and turns out to save one of them.

The film itself, based on the popular and timely novel by Harper Lee, was released in 1962 which was during the civil rights movement. Some critics called this film an innocent film because of the time it was released. It was released back when people were more relaxed, but in the fifty years since then, society has gotten more uptight due to everything that has been going on. Despite a loss of innocence, this is a fantastic movie that has very important themes, even by today's standards. This is one of my all-time favorite movies.",

The redneck father responsible for all this mishigas (James Anderson, who must be great pals with Bill McKinney because their parts are interchangeable) holds a grudge against Peck for defending Peters in the first place, and for proving Peters was innocent in the second place, and for thereby impugning the honor of the Anderson family in the third place. Anderson calls Peck ""a n***** lover"" and spits in his face, but of course Peck would find any response infra dig. Anyway, Anderson sneaks up on Peck's two kids on Halloween night and tries to knife them, but is prevented from doing so -- and is killed -- by Boo Radley (Robert Duvall in a powerful but wordless performance).

Speaking of the children, the film is presented from their point of view, which is also portrayed in a realistic and relatable manner. The children are bubbly, curious and mischievous, trying to find out more about the mysterious Boo Radley and their father's court case, which they hold as highly significant. The defendant is resigned to his fate, weeping yet calm, aware of just how much the world is stacked against him. Lastly, Mayella displays her own kind of anxiety, raging against her circumstances in the only way she knows how, a kind of forlorn anger.

171,28 June 1999,Elizabeth-328,10," Gregory Peck, Oscar winner: Need I say more?","This is one of the classic films of its time, and its subject is as valid now as it was then. It is based upon the famous novel by Harper Lee describing her childhood in Monroeville, Alabamba, in 1932, when people were still reeling from the Great Depression and racial tensions were at their height. This film came out at the time of the civil rights marches and it thus became a beacon of the liberal movement. Gregory Peck, solid as a rock, perfectly plays the heroic local lawyer named Atticus Finch. People often wonder about the name. It has nothing to do with Attica in Greece (the region of Athens). In the old Confederacy, there was a tremendous admiration for classical learning, and people were often given Greek or Latin names of famous classical figures, in the same way that they were often named after George Washington. It was a tradition of the Old South. Atticus was the best friend of Cicero, the ancient Roman author and orator, and a very large number of personal letters between Atticus and Cicero survive, so that Atticus is very famous to classical scholars. And that is the origin of the name. The character is modelled on Amasa Lee, Harper Lee's father, who defended a black client in 1923, as IMDb Trivia informs us. This is certainly one of the most famous films made by the magical partnership of Robert Mulligan, director, and Alan Pakula, producer. I never met Mulligan. But I met Pakula a few times. I once asked him directly why he had taken so long to get around to directing but had spent so many years producing instead. He admitted that he was shy and hesitant about it, that although he had always wanted to direct from the very beginning, he was a slow starter. It was easier to let Mulligan go on directing, while Pakula could stand back and produce and learn more about the craft of directing by watching Mulligan do it. This shows what a quiet, modest and unegotistical man Pakula really was. One of the famous and spectacular performances in this film is of course that of the child actress Mary Badham as 'Scout'. She was nominated for an Oscar. So was Peck, and he won his. Mary Badham's swan song on screen was probably her finest performance ever, four years after this, in the stunningly brilliant film THIS PROPERTY IS CONDEMNED (1966, see my review), a film everybody should see, written by Tennessee Williams. One of the interesting aspects of MOCKINGBIRD today is to see all the children of the town wandering round 'free-range' without any adult supervision or concern. That is what life used to be like. We should all take note of this, because we now live in such a degraded and decadent era when everyone is in a permanent state of cowardly terror about everything. Nowadays, children are being raised indoors like hothouse plants. No wonder they are all allergic to everything, as they are never allowed outside their hermetically-sealed bubbles to gain any immunities. They are being programmed to be fearful of all strangers. Imagine what kind of societies will exist when they all grow up and are so terrified of one another that they cannot cooperate or even talk to one another. The future public is being 'atomised' into cloned 'loners'. They are the ones who go and shoot their friends at school, by the way, because they have been turned into pathological narcissists to whom other people do not exist in any real sense, any more than, say, those pop-up people they 'kill' all day long in their computer games. Yes, we are creating a psychopathic world, and it is time somebody said it. This film makes a timely antidote to the imaginary fears at which we all tremble today, and focuses us instead on genuine social problems to do with prejudice. I daresay, racism has not really diminished at all, it has merely gone underground, because people no longer feel comfortable displaying their prejudices, but conceal them. Racism is part of animal behaviour. After all, rival tribes of chimps don't like each other, and small differences of appearance in humans arouse hysteria. It is not for no reason that people who don't fit in are called 'black sheep'. However, growing up as a species and overcoming prejudice is not being facilitated by the Age of Terror in which we now live, it is making things worse. The story told in this film is too well known to need any repeating by me, that is for sure. But how many people like Atticus exist now? I suspect the time is coming when there will be none at all.",

It really drove home the emotional impact. Bernstein captured the curiosity and fear the kids had for Boo Radley, that later became understanding and appreciation. Other films with great Bernstein scores: The Great Escape (1963), The Magnificent Seven (1960), and The Ten Commandments (1956). Hats off to you, Mister Bernstein.",

The scene really was great both emotionally and technically. It transitions smoothly from the children adventure subject to the serious rape charge clouded in racial prejudice subject.

The cast seems to have stepped right out of Harper Lee's prose and onto the screen being exactly how you would expect them. Gregory Peck (in an Academy Award-winning performance) appears to have been born to play Atticus Finch although the production of such a film would have been unimaginable when Peck came into the world in 1916. Brock Peters as Tom Robinson is equally as fine a choice, and honorable mention should go to James Anderson as the morally corrupt and spiritually void Bob Ewell.

His lawyer basically got a confession that the woman lied about being raped, yet the court still found the man to be guilty. Like I said, this was an interesting scene to me, but it also didn't sit well with me. I hated how everyone in that room was so hateful of a man because of his race, that they chose to go along with a lying woman and her disgusting father.

I just said that to emphasize the power of attraction each individual brings on to the screen. The story does not lose the message of the book and still keeps organization and tension. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' stays modern because its message, performance, storyline, tension, and lighting are subtle not blunt like many other so-called 'classic' films.

Handsome with a deep voice he basically never shows any emotion, smiles or gives at hint that he's trying to be the character in any movie he was in. Even here, he's the only one in a three piece suit that seems to have been tailored to him. In the courtroom scene although William Windom seems to be sweating and has his tie askew Peck looks like he just came out of the tailor. Also, why isn't the prosecuting attorney show to have a closing speech?
As to the charges, you'd really have to be a member to think this guy was guilty. We never get to see a jury selection. We never see how the children are friendly with the black reverend. I still wonder why this film isn't given as an example of the MeToo movement.
The only good acting in the film was by the black defendant, and the girl was supposedly raped. Everyone else was just stereotyped except Peck who couldn't manage a southern accent in the deep south. And when Scout speaks it's almost impossible to understand a word she's saying.

that was shot in the 1960s. Although I will say that it does start off
rather slow but right around when Tom Robinson's court case starts the
movie starts to pick up and become a more interesting movie. Another
good thing about this movie is that other than skipping a few parts it
was a lot like the book that was written and the book was very well
done as well. I think the only weakness of this movie is that it was
shot in the 1960s so being so old the acting isn't always as great and
it was in black and white which can also be less appealing to some
people, mainly teenagers that haven't been exposed to black and white
movies and might not like them as much. All in all, it was a pretty
solid movie, Gregory Peck did a very good job acting as Atticus Finch,
although the rest of the acting wasn't that great but that wasn't all
that relevant because Atticus was really the main guy to watch in the

222,13 April 2015,benbelfield0,7," Fairly engaging, just a rather old movie","This classic was on my revisit watch list for quite sometime. In 1962 it was a much discussed movie of its time due to its bold storyline of a white lawyer Atticus Finch ( Gregory Peck) defending a black man facing a rape charge. The setting is a small town in USA where widower Atticus resides with his two young children Jean and Jem and their black nanny. Atticus attracts the anger and displeasure of the white community for taking up the case to defend a black man and faces humiliation at various times. His kids are also threatened with harm. Director Robert Mulligan had done an excellent job in converting this absorbing screenplay into a riveting movie which deals with prejudice and injustice.

234,16 June 2013,jhkp,5, Overrated,"""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is a 1962 drama directed by Robert Mulligan starring Gregory Peck and Mary Badham. Back when I was in my school years, we got around reading most of the literary classics in English class. I personally had the chance to read ""Death of a Salesman"" or ""Brave New World"", but never actually had the chance to read some other of the most famous works that eventually were adapted to the big screen. Next to ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" the controversial 1961 Harper Lee novel of the same name this movie's based on always had my immense curiosity. It's one of those novels you hear of from countless sources and due to the fact that I really don't have time anymore to voluntarily read books (uni life doesn't allow me!), I decided to skip that and watch it right away. What am I to say? This film's again shown me how much I love my passion. First of all, this film managed to fail my personal expectations and excel them with something even greater instead. I sorta needed to get used to the fact that it's told through the perspective of a young girl and that most of the story focuses on the children. What I expected to be just a two hour depiction of a twisted criminal case turns out to be exactly this, but interwoven into a beautiful coming of age story. The whole film is a single profound metaphor about justice and injustice that lives from all the small details attached to it. It focuses on the unrighteousness and the presence of racism and prejudices. It's told through the eyes of a child that had to deal with it in her juvenile and somewhat naïve stage of life and I think that's one of the best aspects of the narration. Cause children are the purest human beings on earth, you know? It empathically examines the severe danger of ignorance, intolerance and indifference on a level that can be comprehended by everyone. It's a magnificently written story and wonderfully constructed situation that teaches even the ones who thought they'd know it all. It raises both ethically and morally important questions that define and at the same time heavily criticise our society. What is it that makes us so intolerant? Why do we think we stand above other humans? Why do we hate what we fear and why don't we just step over our own opinion? Why is there still so much injustice in this world? The film asks the viewer and mercilessly points out each and every aspect that make anyone who watches it feel uncomfortable, because as shockingly as it sounds, it appeals to both the past and even our modern times and nobody can deny that it's still one of the most grave problems of our society. Lead by an outstanding performance of Peck as charismatic lawyer Atticus Finch, the rest of the cast, especially the child actors, perform on a coequal level and definitely use the full potential of this masterful story. The end of the court scene absolutely enraged me, because this iniquitousness contradicted all of my sense of reason and was simply outrageous to me and I think that's when I knew Harper Lee did her best work. She never intended to reach something else. What has been scandalous then is still relevant now, because this sort of mindset still exists in some people's heads. The final conclusion is also the conclusion of the excellent mockingbird metaphor that teaches us to not fear what we personally don't know and that we shouldn't be killing something that's obviously innocent, only because we are to much filled up with hateful prejudices that doesn't match reality. At the same time though, it subliminally criticises that people always act in their own beliefs of law eventually. That's the quintessence of the story. In the end, I felt so many emotions that I couldn't even completly describe it with words. All in all, this novel adaptation is a perfect example for a magnificent enactment of a literary classic. It's absolutely touching and shocking, mostly thanks to the outstanding achievement in acting and writing. It's compelling storytelling at it's finest and a thought provoking masterpiece that is still relevant today and that everyone should have watched at least once in life. Absolutely brilliant!",

Atticus was bland and uninteresting, Scout looked nothing like the book describes her, Dill was ugly and loud and annoying, the kids in general were really bad actors, the aunt was nowhere near as evil as she is in the book, etc. The lines were all taken directly out of the book, which is something you never do in a movie unless you want it to go really slowly. The story was centered more on the trial, which takes about three chapters in the book, than on the lives of these kids. The trial itself was actually funnier than moving full of overacting and stupidity. None of the actors sounded southern anyway. The book was actually pretty good; I had to read it in class, and then we watched the movie, and it sucked. The direction was really bad too, and the characters had no depth. I mean, I'm 14 and I could do better. You probably think that just because I'm young I can't appreciate a classic, but this thing just sucked.

The ruling class divides people's social and legal status according to the characteristics of race and ethnicity, and acts hostile, persecuted, and unequal to other races.
I can't imagine how disgusting people live in discriminated against. Because I think it is ridiculous to judge by skin color without knowing others. The sheriff chooses to ignore the facts and does not want to disturb a calm mental patient. This is true care for a vulnerable person, as the lawyer said to the child, ""You can't think from the other person's perspective."" You should still look at the problem from the perspective of the other party. For example, when you want to help others, you should think about how to make the other party and yourself feel comfortable. This is a different angle. The results are completely different.

Having quite an experience on the subject, I'd say it has an excellent directing, good scenario, superb acting, specially from the adorable ""Scout"" (sorry, Gregory Peck) and almost perfect photography. Generally speaking for a country with no national core (although ""nation"" is repeatedly used in USA, where the citizens form a unique patchwork of nationalities) for a non US citizen, some things and ideas are not easy to understand. And I dare to say that 3 Academy Awards were a comfortable ""forgiveness"" to the unspeakable racism, even today, in US. I do not mean to insult anyone, but on the other hand, I can not ignore one, maybe the most critical trend on the ""civilized"" world, racism, and spot it whenever recognized.

252,10 August 2004,Ginger87,10, One of the Best Movies Ever!,"One of the best films I've ever seen, a classic that every movie lover must see. The cinematography and editing in it alone was just wonderful. There were many dissolve cuts used throughout, and several medium and medium-long shots as well. I liked the use of the montage in the beginning of the film, followed by the slow tilt to establish the location of the film. However, I really think the use of sound is what brought this film together. There was a narrator, which helped with the flow of the story. The non-diegetic music was great, and wasn't overused like many films do. There was a scene where the child talking overlapped into the next scene. Silence was also used extremely well, and often too. There were several scenes where the dialogue took center stage, with no music playing in the background to take away from it. It was used for suspense too, such as when the dog was put down in front of the kids. The most notable scene, I think, was in the courtroom when Atticus was giving a speech, a very long take was used with silence as he spoke. I think this really helped convey his message, and you could feel the tension as everyone listened on. It's no wonder Gregory Peck won best actor for this film, as his acting was played with sincerity and perfection.",
253,11 May 2017,j-maloney13,9, amazing film,"I finally saw this movie last night after I checked it out at my local library. This is a wonderful service of our state tax dollars, loading up on a bunch of DVD's that we all can check out for free. Anyways, I checked out this movie as it is called by most movie fan's as a classic and supposedly one of Gregory Peck's greatest roles, especially since he won an Academy Award for his performance. Without going into a lengthy review, I will say that I went in expecting a riveting, profound movie with excellent court scenes throughout most of the movie. While there is some genuinely interesting, thoughtfully written and superbly executed court drama going on, it couldn't have been more than 25 minutes of this two-hour movie. The remains of the time goes to the two children and what they get themselves into while Atticus is off at the courtroom. While that would have been perfectly fine for say, 30 minutes or so, it runs rampant at nearly 90 minutes of the movie. This was honestly astounding as I thought this was going to be a courtroom drama with minimal activity outside of it. This was hardly the case. Still, it is far from a bad movie, and the scenes with the children are entertaining in their simplicity of a time long since gone. And Peck, while a bit emotionally stunted (as usual), still does a very good job in his role (though I am interested in the quality of the other Oscar-nominated actors from that year because I don't see Peck's role as an Oscar winner, rather just Nomination-worthy.",
254,2 May 2007,tmojoman,6, A Classic...? Really?,"The courtroom procedure is the worst ever shown on the big screen. Lawyer Finch never brought up the impossibility of a one handed rapist to choke his victim as described. He did a silly exercise to show the girl's father was left-handed yet never brought this point home. He never brought up character references to show the reliability of the defendant. This oversight even existed in the novel, even though Tom's employer interrupted the court to pronounce this fact, and was dismissed from court. Prior to the trial the movie was more believable than the novel, which portrayed a first grade girl with vocabulary and reasoning ability of a much older person. This reminded me of a similar performance by the similarly aged young boy in the novel ""Painted House"". Just not realistic. I realize that to be critical of such a popular movie is akin to griping about movies such as ""Casablanca"", ""Miracle on Forty Second Street"", ""Its A Wonderful Life"", and their brethren. To my mind the performance of Gregory Peck is the bright spot in an otherwise boring movie. The bright spot was the statement by the black preacher to ""Rise; Your father is passing"".",

I honestly don't know what I was smoking in high-school cause this movie was great! The dialog was what stood out to me at first, It so fast and funny and charming.

The pivotal moment in which the jury returns with its verdict is still a stunner. Released in 1962, but set during the Great Depression, this dramatized depiction of the noble attorney Atticus Finch, his family, and the community in which he practices his profession offers a (still) powerful and necessary indictment of racism as consisting of an entire social system. Just about everything about this film is superb, including the acting of Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch (for which Peck won an Oscar) and Mary Badham and Philip Alford as his children, Scout and Jem, along with the remainder of the cast. The direction by Robert Mulligan also heightens the drama. ",

258,28 April 2020,f-57307,8, great!,"From its unconventional main title sequence, celebrating the lost recesses of a child's imagination, to the quiet rectitude with which Gregory Peck transformed a seemingly soft spoken gentleman into the very pillar of masculine integrity, there was much to admire in Robert Mulligan's graceful production of To Kill A Mockingbird (1962). Based on the novel my Harper Lee, the film tells the story of a small town lawyer, Atticus Finch (Peck) and his unassuming determination to exonerate a black man, Tom Robinson (Brook Peters) from the false accusation of raping a white farm girl, Mayella Violet Ewell (Collin Wilcox). A seasoned critique of racial prejudice and family abuse, the story diverges from this public scandal into an intimate snapshot of family life from the period. Atticus's children Jem (Philip Alfort) and Scout (Mary Badham) share an unjustified fear and mistrust of mentally challenged neighborhood boy, Boo Hadley (Robert Duvall) in a secondary narrative that only serves to reinforce the story's central theme of tolerance. On every level, the film is a vintage class act. Small wonder then that in a recent AFI poll of the most popular screen heroes, Atticus Finch topped out at number one. Throughout the filming, Gregory Peck referred to a pocket watch to keep his character on time. The watch was a studio prop. But after Harper Lee saw the film she gave Peck a time piece belonging to her late father, on which Atticus was based, because his performance so reminded her of him. As an actor, Peck could have been paid no finer compliment.",

This is the classic movie based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel. The story is very powerful as it shows how a white lawyer named Aticus Finch (Gregory Peck) defends a black man accused of rape in a racially divided town. The story also shows how he raises his children. He has a tomboy daughter named Scout, and an intelligent son named Jeremy. The meaning of To Kill A Mockingbird is great, but you have to watch it to figure out what the meaning of this classic film is. The character development is great as we see how Aticus Finch deals with his job difficulties, as well as life difficulties. Scout learns how to deal with people in her way, and Jeremy learns that as brave as he is, there is still danger and evil in the world.",

Indeed, it's not only one of the greatest movies ever made, it's a movie which can not come out of date. I would disagree with `Smatysia' from Houston: `The heroic liberal fighting injustice' is a theme whose time has not yet passed. A number of prejudices still live and there are still `a lot of ugly things in this world '. Though such cases as described in the story are impossible nowadays, it's the reason not to forget that they were possible ones, but to be proud of the society's development. We must be very careful and try to understand people considering things from their point of view (`You never really knew a man until you stood in his shoes and walked around in them'). My words may seem naive, but the film does not. It's very intelligent movie without becoming preachy or otherwise sentimental. You come to understanding what is right or wrong simply by sympathizing with the heroes of the story.  Furthermore, it's a wonderful example of educating children rightly. Gregory Peck creates a splendid image of Atticus Finch, honest, dignified and courageous lawyer as well as wise and tender father, who is able to explain anything. I can do otherwise but admire him. The scene in the court is especially powerful; it moves me every time I watch it. On the whole, the film is interesting and charming with masterful camera work and beautiful music. The scenery really gives you a sample of what life was like in Southern states during the Great Depression. Children actors are fantastically good. They are so natural, you feel as participating in their small adventures, fantasies, new experiences and impressions.  I would recommend this film to all  youngsters and adults. It's an unparalleled story about right way of living in the world and keeping your head high in spite of prejudices.",
275,6 November 2001,o_levina,10, The film is better than I can present it,"I have seen many reviewers complaining about the simple message presented in this film- of the evil of prejudice. They say the film languidly hugs this simple message, and there isn't much else to this film. I think they are misinformed. Oftentimes it is not so much the depth of the message, but rather how it is presented which is important. To kill a mockingbird stands testament to this fact. It presents its simple message clearly and beautifully, with the right mix of the rational and the emotional, to show us, vividly, the dangers of prejudice and racism. The dangers of prejudice is presented through two parallel stories, one involving the main plot going on in the courtroom, and the other with the sub plot taking place near Boos house. In the main courtroom plot involving the grown ups, a black man dies because of the prejudice surrounding his skin colour, that the white men in the jury dismiss the veracity of his statement entirely just because he is black. In the sub plot involving the children, Scout and Jem are prejudiced towards this Boo character which they have never met. They have only heard rumours and hearsay purporting him to be a dangerous lunatic. In the main plot, justice is not served, and the black man dies. In the sub plot, Boo is revealed to be a gentle, even brave person who helps the children fend off an attack. The children are witness to the main plot and participants in the sub plot, and they learn through these two experiences of the dangers of prejudice. This simple message is delivered poignantly and powerfully through these two parallel stories. Gregory Peck, in a cinematic coup, delivers a restrained, yet powerful performance as the lawyer defending the black man. He does not break into melodramatic emotionality because Peck strives for realism, so what we get is a repressed, but still vividly felt performance of indignance and anger. A rare accomplishment for any actor. My only complaint with the film however, is that it is undeniably slow, and only picks up steam at the second half. I feel the first half could have been sped up by devoting less time to the children and their adventures. Overall, To kill a mockingbird is an undisputed masterpiece of cinema, of a message rarely done just right- a special achievement for any movie with a message.",

The same could be said of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". I think that a lot of the ""greatest movie ever made"" reviews are commentary about the movie's message and the social impact it had. The movie delivered a message about racism at a point in our history in which messages about racism were badly needed, and for that, the movie is commendable. But from a cinematic standpoint, it's a mess. The first hour is little more than kids running around, playing, getting into fights, and prowling around the neighborhood spooky house. The trial is a relatively brief and underdeveloped part of the movie and the acting - other than Peck's - is hammy and overwrought. The movie's end is almost completely disconnected from the rest of the plot.",
288,7 February 2023,jjplato,4, A landmark and a bad movie at the same time,It's one of the longest & finest courtroom trial scene of my movie watching experience. Watching the facial expression of that black man named Tom Robinson on trial sitting on the confession chair just melts my emotions deeply. Next to those goddamn natural expressions you witness a mind blowing speech delivered by Gregory Peck as defending lawyer Atticus Finch (It reminds me the great climactic speech delivered by Pacino in 'Scent of Women'). The scene ends with touching standing ovation of all the black men in the court for the white lawyer who's the last man vacating the court & it's a moment where you feel to shout- What a scene!! ,

The kids did an excellent job of acting, and the little girl who played Scout had never even acted or been trained in acting before!  There was a great depth to the characters and a great mysterious aura to the Radley house.  Gregory Peck, as usual, did a great job in his part, and the man who played Tom Robinson did, too.  For me it was a riveting movie, though there were no explosions or shoot-outs or high-tech graphics.  It was plain and simple but effective. There were some funny moments, some scary moments, some emotional moments. I saw it in the original B&W on DVD...At first I wished I could see it in color, but then I thought making it in B&W gave it more mystery and interest.  The ""Fearful Symmetry"" (making of the movie) was very interesting, too, talking about what we have lost as a country, even while we have gained things.

The movie is focused around such serious issues that the parallel story of the kids and Boo Radley adds just enough innocence and mystery to make it appropriate for most audiences. I've always admired the crisp image this movie has despite it being in black and white. This possibly may be due to some sort of remastering but I'm still impressed. Also, I took note of the audio not sounding drowned out like some older films do. The audio was just as crisp as the cinematography.

Mary Badham as Scout was absolutely magnificent, Phillip Alford as Jem was very good, and Estelle Evans as Calpurnia made a strong impact. The story itself is so piercing and heartbreaking, in that it combines a severe social problem of the American deeply rooted racism, as well as depicting an exemplary father figure and tenderly describing the people and events that affect a child's education.

Remember the Civil rights Act was passed in to law only in 1964. This film has lost nothing of its relevance today and doesn't give in to blatant innocence so common in American cinema of the era, largely influenced by the Disney studios. This film is in no way complacent and very watchable by today's standards. But what makes it most remarkable is the children's portrayals. The story is largely told from their point of view, especially that of scout, the wonderful and mischievous little girl, son natural and endearing.

The music perfectly embodies the mood - from innocence and carefree to brooding and climatic. It is one of the greatest scores I've ever heard. Gregory Peck is stunning but Mary Badham as Scout is the true star to me. She had no prior acting experience and should have won the best supporting actor Oscar in 1962. At times her acting seems so real, almost like she's not acting. Her facial expressions alone show her natural talent - sublime. Robert Duvall ( in his first role ) is a silent force as the misunderstood, gentle giant Boo Radley. The plot of racial injustice and false accusations in the Great Depression-era deep south is tough topic to broach. America's constant struggle with the ghost of slavery and the indignation suffered by African Americans intertwined with the plot of the accused, Tom.

Hats off to Gregory Peck for a superb acting job as Atticus. Robert Duvall has a small but very pivotal part in this movie. He does an excellent job as well. On another front, the musical score soothes its way into your heart from the start of the movie and stays with you for a long time afterwards. The message of Love and Compassion is the central theme of this movie, and by my estimation, it has rarely been so well communicated.

333,19 February 2002,jersey_girl03,2, what the heck were you people thinking?,"To Kill A Mockingbird is a great example of a book adaptation gone right. It knows what details to keep and which ones to leave alone, and therefore creates a sympathetic, complex, cohesive film. The way the film handles race, class, childhood and poverty, was not made this film stand out at the time it was released, but is relevant even now. All of the performances here are really stellar, but Gregory Peck's performance of Atticus Finch and Brock Peters performance of Tom Robinson are the stand outs. The emotion and dedication both bring to their roles is astounding. Every time Atticus is on screen, he steals the show. The character's quiet compassion and brilliance are really translated well to the film, and he really holds the film together. For me, the parts that fall a little more flat are mostly the parts that have to do with Scout, which is a shame considering she's our main character. It's not that she's performed poorly or anything, but often times shots linger on her for too long or the writing for her is just not very good. The child acting in this movie is overall very good, with Phillip Alford's portrayal of Jem being the highlight. Dill and Scout are more just okay than anything else, but it isn't a detrimental things at all. The main problems I have with the film are all hinged on the way Scout is written. Sometimes just seems to do things for no other reason than to progress the plot, rather than to actually contribute to the message of the film. All in all though, To Kill A Mockingbird is a poignant film that I can easily recommend. 8.9/10",
334,28 March 2017,Jared9001,8, A great adaptation with a few writing flaws.,"A movie that shows the ugliness of ignorance, poverty and racism in the Deep South of the 1930s hardly seems a premise for a much-loved movie but this is exactly what you have in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Although this is told from the memories of a now-adult Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch, this movie is multi-dimensional. You see the events from the points of the children, the adults, the victims and the so-called superior whites. It is a stunning and shattering revelation that one group can think itself superior and give little or no thought to those who are ""inferior."" And when one man - Atticus Finch - dares to do just that, he is vilified and literally spit upon by one of the seemingly superior whites, who, in reality, is a lout, a boor and a drunk. Most reviewers have praised the performances of the children and of Gregory Peck and most rightfully so. But to me, the performance that stands out most is that of the gentleman who portrays Rev. Sikes. When he says, ""Jean Louise! Jean Louise! Stand up ... your father's passing"" - it is the most riveting scene in the entire movie. No matter how many times I see it, it tears me up inside. Wow! Another riveting scene to me is Brock Peters as Tom Robinson, as he testifies in his own behalf. With tears streaming down his face, he tells what happened at Mayella's house. The pain in his face is palpable. But what I remember about Brock Peters, however, is what he did off screen. At Gregory Peck's funeral, Mr. Peters, who died 2 or 3 years later, praised Mr. Peck for his performance and he thanked the late actor for the privilege it gave him to work on TKAM. That was 40 years after the movie and yet Mr. Peters still praised Mr. Peck. THAT was classy.",

The acting is certainly spot on and every actor and actress that was cast certainly owned the character they were assigned. The cinematography had to be the best part of this film. It really focused where the action was making it easy for the viewers to see the action or keep them in suspense until later on in the movie. The lack of light in some parts of the film also helped to heighten this film's intensity. As someone who has also read the book, I am surprised at how some of the cinematic characteristics have stayed true to what was written in the book.",
336,11 May 2016,j-goslin,10, One of my alltime favorites,"There aren't enough positive adjectives in all the languages of the world to praise this film.  Gregory Peck is perfect (as he usually is) Brock Peters shows his true acting ability, and Robert Duvall is classic as Boo Radley (and I believe this was his first film role). The three children-Jem, Scout and Dill, are all so believable and well acted that every time I see this film, I feel as more like I'm eavesdropping on a period in the past, rather than watching a movie.  It is indeed a rare classic, and well worth anyone's time to watch!",
337,21 July 2000,Mr Skoooooter,10, A Flawlessly delivered Classic!,"There are many compliments, and comments I can give about this film since it's so great. The acting is superb, each acting is perfect for showing there part of the movie, especially Gregory Peck. The characters are great, and if you've seen AFI's 100 Heroes & Villians Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck) is #1 on the list for heroes. The character of Atticus Finch is so great, standing against all the prejudice, and hatred in the world standing along the side of the black man. Not just the book is great, but the screenplay is tremendous, Horton Foote does a great job from getting the characters out of the book and into the movie, and does a great job showing how falsely accused the black man is. The directing is excellent, and producing. Everything is excellent creating one great movie. I would see this right now if you haven't, nobody could refuse this movie at any cost. You may find some parts sad but the children clean that up right away, plus the ending would wipe the record clean. So see this movie and at the end you'll know you haven't wasted $5 on a crappy movie.",

I'm a screenwriter and I have to admit that after viewing this ""scramble"", I'd like to spend some time trying to fix it, but I'm afraid that it would take way too much time.
My favor character was by far, Scout! She has so much spunk and stands up for herself as I'd want my daughter to do. Mr. Atticka Finch was indeed a southern gentleman and a great lawyer. Unfortunately, in that time and place, (which I grew up in) there was no way a Black man would have won that case. So that much was sadly real and true.
The court action started well, but fell apart because it was way too long. I can believe that they took Tom to a different location for his safety and murdered him. That was a common practice in the south. But what happened to the kids in the woods coming home at night was totally confusing. And who was the white man hiding behind the door after the fact? Who exactly was he supposed to be?
This movie was very poorly done and I would not recommend it to anyone, even my worst enemy. 
I hate it when I have more questions about a movie while the end credits are rolling.

Director Mulligan seems to be very skilled in his direction of the child actors, and the admittedly conventional camera work is well suited to the stately pace of the script. Peck is good as Finch; his performance is not amazing but it's enjoyable enough. Robert Duvall also makes a small appearance in one of the most touching scenes. Topping things off, Elmer Bernstein's score is magnificent. Perhaps this is an under-rated film, maybe because it doesn't take many risks, but it's one of the finest to emerge from the changing American cinema of the 60s.",

I envy those who in 1962 could appreciate this jewel in cinemas, because certainly, it is a film that address different issues, including racism, poverty, justice, morals, transports us to our childhood making us children again in clothes of Jem, Scout and Dill, transporting us to our younger years, and confirming that good triumphs over evil. Undoubtedly, To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), becomes one of my favorite movies.",
343,28 February 2019,lobosalvaje,8, To Kill a Mockingbird (1962),"Being a film student, I have known about 'To Kill a Mockingbird' for ages. My father had a copy on our bookshelf while I was growing up (he was a voracious reader). I was always puzzled by the title, and had no idea what the story was about. And, I had known about the film for many years, but had put it off - even though I'm a fairly big Gregory Peck fan. So I finally bought the DVD, and I must agree with that gentleman from Troy, NY. A lot of his comments are right on the mark. However, I disagree with his attack on the Finch legacy. Yes, their ancestors probably owned slaves, and that was no doubt the base for their family economy and fortune. But to fault them as being hypocrites; this is unfair. Can you say that all liberals in the South are hypocrites? No! Someone has to turn the tide in such a racially volatile area. However, the film takes its sweet time developing, and there is a severe lack of conflict in the first half, and even the second half. I think much of this is due to the smarmy portrayal of the children, and the obvious idyllic life in their small town. Also, the characters on both sides are too black and white (no pun intended!). Although James Anderson does a SUPERB job playing Bob Ewell (He made me hate that character so much!), this is a stereotype. Also, the blacks in the film are southern stereotypes too. They're all humble, forgiving, obedient, etc. It would've been nice to see an angry young man or woman amongst them. Also, I thought that in the novel Mayell finally confesses she committed perjury, but there's no evidence of this in the film. So, I give this a '7' for the acting, production values, and direction. I enjoyed it somewhat the first time, but now I feel I watched it more out of duty than anything else.",
344,2 December 2007,brad_and_ethan,7," Imperfect, Populist 'Must-See Classic'","This was some bold subject matter, and it is semi-autobiographical. The movie came out two years after the book, and the fact that Civil Rights was still going on is why this was all such a big deal. What really shows the risk factor, is how such a divisive issue is shown through the eyes of Scout, and not Atticus. It's a great idea, and really gives some thought provoking insight by framing such a big issue through the eyes of a young, precocious child. This also serves as a great way to educate children on the issue. The performances all around are brilliant. The kids are great and likable (which is quite a rarity), Robert Duvall makes a stunning film debut, Brock Peters is agonizingly sympathetic and compelling as Robinson, and then we get the man who really shines above all: Gregory Peck. This was a much deserved Oscar winning and career defining performance for him, and it really is one of the greats. He's wonderful through the whole thing, and he comes off as the kind of dad a person would love to have as their own. What seals the deal though is his lengthy courtroom monologue. I get all kinds of shaken and emotionally stirred up every time I watch that scene. It's some of the most powerful, riveting, and memorable acting ever put on film.",

348,1 June 2010,TooManyFives,10, I hope this film will change and inspire you.,"To Kill a Mockingbird started as a book, and when I read it, I didn't understand what the heck I was reading. It got confusing at some points, and I got mixed up with all the characters. When I saw the movie, I really enjoyed watching it, the acting the amazing for two little kids, and it really affected the deep plot of the story. The portrayal of the two kids showed the audience that these were two little, innocent kids who lived in a world much bigger and more complex than it should be for any kid. Atticus Finch, the dad, a troubled lawyer, who defended people, was no help to the kids, but moved the story along with lots of events. Racism is also portrayed here, involving hate crimes and other racist remarks and actions. Then there's the mysterious and ""frightening"" neighbors the kids are so curious of. He lives all alone in his old house, and they find out what's going on in there. Like all children, kids are curious of everything and will do anything to find their answers to their dangerous and innocent questions. The cinematography for the film also made it more relaxing, and the story line moved well after the beginning. The beginning goes a little slow, but not enough, hopefully to put you to sleep. To Kill A Mockingbird is probably one of the most important films of all time, because of the plot, acting and it's moral, that teaches all viewers and valuable lesson in life.",

To add to that, it is a story that serves as a model for rectitude and moral righteousness. Gregory Peck's delivery of the case summary, pleading not guilty to the jury, was just the icing on the overall brilliant performance throughout the film. While it started off as a feel-good movie where the children seemed cushioned away from any vile forces that existed, it was far from being like that throughout. The acting by the children is genuine and true to their parts, with all the three child actors pleasing the eye at all times. The movie deals with the issues of slavery, dealing with ethical conundrums, tolerance and acting as role models for our young ones. The courtroom scene was so well played that there is not a single moment when the viewer is not glued to the screen, ever so eager to know more about the case and judge for themselves the verdict of the case. The scuffle at the end and the suspense that ensued was riveting. And finally, the character of Boo Radley, that was constructed over the course of the movie through the interaction of the children with Atticus and the neighbors, and their own forays into exploring the dark and the unknown, cumulates into one with one final act committed by him: a selfless act, a courageous act, a virtuous act, yet an act of a Mockingbird. The message that goes across is that selfless and virtuous acts are always respected by everyone and if we stay true to the moral education imparted to us by our elders, we can all make a difference and make this world a better place to live in.",

Gregory Peck is absolutely perfect as Atticus Finch, the intelligent and kind father of Scout and Jem, and Robert Duvall is able to depict Boo Radley's deep pain without saying a word. One amazing thing about this film is the way that it is from the perspective of a child. Director Robert Mulligan is able to flawlessly translate this from the book, and ensures that it does not falter throughout the movie. The black-and- white cinematography is evocative of the 1930s Deep South, but To Kill a Mockingbird is not just a period piece. Unfortunately, its portrayal of racism and a corrupt legal system are still relevant today. It is an important film in terms of style and content, and one that I will definitely be seeing again.",

I felt the cinematography was excellent throughout the film. In particular, the court scenes were always put together with true artistic abilities. The way camera angles and lighting was used really brought a strong presence to the scene that I wouldn't have been able to get from just reading the book.

Who is Boo, what does Boo look like, and is Boo a mean person? Another thing that makes the audience guessing is Tom Robinson actually the rapist? I thought that all of the acting was good, but the best character is Atticus. In the town the nicest person and the person that is the least racist is Atticus. Atticus is defending Tom Robinson in court. The court says that Tom Robinson raped Mayella Ewell, but Atticus says that there is no evidence of Tom Robinson raping her. Once Atticus is finally tired of people saying that Tom Robinson raped her he gives an amazing speech which changes everyone's mind about who did it.

It shows how even when a black man is proven without any reasonable doubt to be innocent of a crime how he can never truly receive fair treatment. Rather, due to his skin color he is found guilty of the crime anyway and later is killed for it, though not executed by any legal means. This only exemplified the way America viewed Blacks during the Jim Crow Era, as second class citizens or to some much more racist groups, animals.
The movie was entertaining to a fault and shows how to a child, everyone is equal and that it is a child's innocence that makes them unique. As odd as that is to see in a movie, when a child sees the good in someone when everyone else refuses to or the child makes a grown man feel ashamed for doing something wrong it makes the film that much better!",

In my opinion, the film wasn't fully capable of bringing the origin author, Harper-Lee was trying to express, since some parts from the novel were left out, making the events rather irrelevant to the book. Another thing is that the focusing was not so appropriate: the focus should be put on the rape trial; but in the film, the rape trial was rather sketchy. However, the junior actors (the children) acted well, as well as Gregory Peck (as Atticus). In conclusion, the film is generally acceptable, but not so eminent at all.",

Right after i finished reading the book i decided to watch the movie since I've heard what Justice it did to the book. I went in with high hopes. Boyyyyy was i wrong. The acting was pretttty bad from the kids, tom was pretty good, atticus was great, and everything else sucked. The movie left out really touching parts from the book. It also it did not emphasize the importance of certain characters. The court scene was terrible. It was not as powerful as it was in the book. The acting was DREADFUL. I ended up turning the movie off before it ended because i could not handle such a beautiful book be chopped and messed around with as badly as it was. The movie was such a disappointment i cannot wait for it to be remade by someone who actually loved the book and can truly capture its beauty and can be played by people that can *hopefully act and portray the characters in a much better way.

Gregory Peck does a fantastic job as Atticus Finch, portraying a nuanced and wise character who inspires a felling of warmth and confidence. While he is the standout in the movie, even the child actors do a great job, turning in performances that feel realistic. The movie's style is very grounded, doing away with flashy camera angles or shots to instead provide a more subtle, plain take on the world. This works well as the story is attempting to deliver an important social message so the world feeling unassuming and close to our own is important. The social message is the greatest strength of the movie, it handles issues of race very well and manages to tell a moving and striking story.

The child's narration imbues this film with a sense of wonder, adventure, love and innocence that help the story work on several levels: as an adventure and morality play for children; as an absorbing social commentary on racism; as a way for adults to rediscover the joys and wonder of those childhood years; and as a celebration of all those things that make families the bedrock of a civilized nation.

That dash of subtlety needed for the role was perfect, at the same time maintaining Atticus' dignity without coming across as too stern or adamant. I thought he was amazing.

The only other American classic I've watched is ""12 angry men"" and it seems that the slow narrative cinematography was the zeitgeist But there is no doubt in my mind that this is an epic movie. The first three quarters of the movie took me back to my childhood. The mannerisms and the social setting was very similar. ""Scout"", ""Jem"" and ""Dill's"" artlessness was extremely charming.

421,18 February 2003,cupfan18,10, Cinematic Perfection,"I have seen this film several times over the years, from childhood to middle age. I used to like it better, as a child, than I do now, as a middle-aged woman. Parts of the film, most notably the lyrical and sometimes humorous treatment of childhood and maturation, remain moving and beautiful. The segments about the unbalanced neighbor are just as scary for me today as in the 1960's. I wish to raise a point on which I will concede that I am acutely sensitive. What bothers me about this film (and probably would about the book, tho' I haven't read it) is its treatment of the white woman and her allegation--namely, that she must (of course!) be lying. I'm well aware that there was and is plenty of racism in our society, and that grave injustices have been and sometimes still are committed. However, all too often members of society seek to ""make up"" (as tho' that were possible) for past injustices by inflicting new ones, or to use this line of reasoning as an excuse to not deal with real problems. I spent 17 1/2 years in school and I've been in the working world for a quarter-century in several different organizations; in all of these places, I've experienced a lot of harassment, both physical and verbal. I can assure you that even today, supervisors, coworkers, the whole personnel and management apparatus will do practically anything to avoid having to deal with harassment, particularly sexual harassment, just as they failed to deal effectively with it in any of the schools I attended. To use a legal term, the burden of proof rests squarely on the accuser, to report, document, and (my personal favorite!), explain why the person would do what he's doing, rather than put the harasser on notice that his behavior is totally unacceptable and must stop. No, instead these caring/sharing/wonderful folks in society want to examine your words and deeds to see whether you did anything to provoke the harasser. Then come the excuses; he's having problems at home/school/work, so you should exercise a little forbearance when he hits you, screams obscenities at you, and otherwise treats you like dirt. Or, he comes from a ""different culture"" (which, near as I can tell, is code for he's from somewhere--perhaps from somewhere as nearby as his own head--where it's OK to treat girls and women as 3 steps lower than a goat--who knows, maybe it's just your perceptions that are off!). So, these sweetly reasonable, compassionate people imply that it's OK for him to scream, or hit, or kick you. Of course the problem isn't that he doesn't choose to exercise the ordinary self-control required of civilized beings, or that the powers that be, thru their excuses and inaction, tacitly but nevertheless clearly communicate to him that it's OK to continue behaving this way. It's rather as if they want to balance the whole burden of society's past problems on your back! Of course they can preach to you in this offensive way--after all, it's Just you it's happening to, not them! Observe what happened to Anita Hill at the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. If that disgraceful episode proved anything, it's that women are the only group in America that it's still OK to treat badly. I realize that in this film, the viewer is supposed to know that the accused man is innocent, not guilty. I just wish the powers that be, the PC crowd, could've used some other example to show this. And I wish that some of the admiring viewers could discern the major flaw in this film.",

If you read the book or see the movie today, you HAVE to remember that this story was written in a time where the issues covered by this story were not just controversial, but nuclear in their heat. The characters depicted (outside of Atticus Finch and his kids) were not stereotypes, but the mainstream. Harper Lee's story and Horton Foote's adaptation are miraculous. The acting is superb. The subtlety of the scenes, awesome. Citizen Kane, Casablanca, are great movies, but To Kill a Mockingbird transcends all. PLEASE put your mind in that time before you watch this movie and you will see how great it really is. OK, that covers the trial, but then you get to the heart of the story and how Scout brings the innocence we are all born with into fruition. She tells us that Mr. Cunningham and all of us that wander astray can be redeemed. This isn't a story with one aim, this is a masterpiece that brings all things right.

The hallmark of this movie is, even though its extremely adored by all class, say children and adults, the script is strict and concentrates on accomplishing what started in the title card. The court proceedings, the fear and stealthy games of children makes this movie one of the best ever. The values which the movie stress upon are phenomenal. ",

When Atticus defends a black man Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) who has been wrongfully accused of raping of a white woman, Jem and Scout are confronted with conflict from classmates at school. This conflict raises questions that motivate the children to go on adventures to satisfy their curiosity. They are curious as to why so many people hate Atticus for defending a black man. The children get a dose of reality of how cruel people are when it comes to black people when they enter the courtroom to watch the trial. The children have no prejudice and this is seen when they sit on the balcony with all the other curious black people.

I think the only weakness of this movie is that it was shot in the 1960s so being so old the acting isn't always as great and it was in black and white which can also be less appealing to some people, mainly teenagers that haven't been exposed to black and white movies and might not like them as much. All in all, it was a pretty solid movie, Gregory Peck did a very good job acting as Atticus Finch, although the rest of the acting wasn't that great but that wasn't all that relevant because Atticus was really the main guy to watch in the movie.

She properly displays Scout's innocence and that is a huge theme in the book. Scout's discovery of the racism within her town shows the malicious behaviors of the white people and the mistreatment of the black community.

I can merely remember in ninth grade when this book first caught my attention. This was the first time my teachers had addressed the issue of discrimination and we were able to, as a class, openly discuss about it. I was excited to see that this intriguing tale came to life in a movie! To Kill A Mockingbird is set in Alabama in the 1930's. The film was released in 1962 however, and it is interesting enough that this was also a time of major movement for civil rights in America. In the movie, Atticus Finch is a young attorney with two young children, Jem and Scout, and he chooses to defend a black man who was being accused of raping a white woman. Although this sounds like a horror story, this was actually a major issue during this time. Whites were falsely accusing black men of things they were completely innocent for primarily because of the increasing use of discrimination. Discrimination was becoming increasingly more common during the 1950's and 60's because of many new reforms against segregation. Blacks were gradually rising up against the white for equality, Although it was working, whites (especially in the south) were so angry with these changes that they would do anything to put a black man away for good even if the man was completely innocent. This was a crazy time period in our American history and To Kill A Mockingbird greatly reflects on those issues. To Kill A Mockingbird is hands-down a must-see film! It is such an incredible story that every American should hear and understand... To me, it really grasps the idea of how times used to be and also goes to show how things have changed.

In her adventures with her brother and other various friends, Scout learns the sometimes grim realities of the world she lives in. When the trial of Tom Robinson comes about, a black man accused of the rape of a white woman, the viewer learns the harsh realities of the time through Scout's childish ignorance. She cannot comprehend why it is that the townspeople hate her father for defending this man, or why they are bent on convicting a man who clearly has not committed the aforementioned crime, yet it becomes painfully obvious to the viewer just how racist the town of Maycomb is as the plot builds.

Climbing trees? Playing games outside late into darkness? Having one neighbor who scared them, whether it was right or not? Ah, the rural South. So much of this life is now lost  some of it, thankfully so. But much is missed. Must we lose the graciousness of such a life to get rid of the evil and prejudices?",

Evocative, touching without being saccharine, and -- a dying breed -- a movie that's ABOUT something. This is one of those films that never gets old either in its message or its style. Unlike many other films that rely too heavily on voiceover narration, the film uses just enough of the poetry of Harper Lee's first-person tale to set the stage and bookend her poetic fable. And the characters are not stereotypes, nor even mere archetypes. Gregory Peck is splendidly dignified and understated as Atticus Finch, and Mary Badham and Brock Peters are first rate. Robert Duvall's ""Boo"" Radley is one of the great performances in all of film. The lyrical score (Elmer Bernstein), black-and-white cinematography (Russell Harlan), and beautifully detailed art direction (Henry Bumstead) support Robert Mulligan's deft direction. Parents, take your children to see this film! -- at a revival or repertory theater if possible, or if not, rent the widescreen version of the video. This is better education in social values than can be had in classroom -- and can't help but touch young people at their core without being preachy or self-righteous.

Atticus is also trying to prevent his two kids named Scout and Jem, from prejudice. This movie has a lot of positives with very little negatives, the story is based on a hit novel, not much is changed, and is overall a pretty good adaptation. My only complaint is that the movie was filmed in black and white to keep the 1930s aesthetic. The movie was almost as great as the novel, but they did remove some things, like they removed some characters from the book like Francis Hancock, and Aunt Alexandra. Even though this is a serious movie, there are some funny moments, like Scout goes in a tire and crashes into a building, and the actors for Jem and Dill made their respective characters feel real.

The plot of the movie is simple and uncluttered. There are two main stories, which quite possibly could be independently told (of course at the cost of snatching away a lot of beauty that comes with putting them together), but still there is a distinct common theme - prejudice. In fact a lot of more modern day movies touch this theme, I believe Crash and American History X would be two good examples. The thing about Mocking Bird is that the symbolisms are much more basic, in a very good way. The other distinctive feature is the strength of some of the characters  fairness, self-respect, and somewhat more subtle - love for ones family and the instinct to protect or just the urge to stick around to make sure that others are safe.",

That language is not poetic in the sense of using the familiar to define the unfamiliar; instead it works the other way and is shocking and effective. To appreciate the book, you have to know Truman Capote's manner of enlarging the small, finding decision points inside characters and stringing them together in an external logic. Lee's approach to writing is to add another layer of observation: essentially she is reporting her view of what his view would have been. (The Dill character is Capote.) The mockingbird is a mimic who reports the songs of other birds found in its territory. It is fiercely territorial and seems to define its own identity as definer/reporter of that place.",

509,21 July 2010,lndever2000,10, To Kill a Mockingbird (1962),"To Kill a Mockingbird is a film based on a novel by Harper Lee. Atticus Finch played by Gregory Peck, is an attorney in Alabama in the 1930, hired to defend a black man, Tom Robins, who is accused of assaulting and raping a young white women. Along the way, widowed Atticus' children Scout (Mary Badham) a six year old tomboy and Jem (Phillip Alford) her ten year old brother and their summer friend Dill (John Megna) learn valuable life lessons which become the theme of the film. Lessons of innocence, injustice and prejudice, of maturity and growing up, and of friendship and acceptance. In the film, the children are innocent young individuals, Tom Robins is a falsely accused man, and Boo Radley is also not what he is accused of being. The children witness the prejudices against Tom Robins when he is unjustly accused of raping a white woman. They also see their father courageously trying to defend an innocent man despite the opinions of those who believe he is guilty just because he is black. The children also learn to accept and befriend the mysterious shut-in Boo Radley that saved their lives. The children thought he was a monster and were fearful of him only to find that what they thought of him was very wrong. Throughout the film, unknown to them, Boo looks out for the children. He leaves them gifts, and helps them. When Scout and Boo finally meet, he seems as afraid of her as the children have always been of him. The sound effects and music in the film definitely add to the mood and atmosphere. The music was fairly simple but contributed to the feel of innocence and energy when the children were on screen. The music didn't get overpowering during the suspenseful scenes, more mischievous than scary. When Boo finally appears in the movie, he is hiding behind a door, his face fully in the shadows. The lighting accentuates the mystery behind the stranger. Scout eventually takes his hand and brings him into the light without hesitation or fear of the man that was so misunderstood. By the end of the film, the children certainly aren't as innocent as they started out. The lessons that they learned were life changing and profound. The saw what prejudice and injustice can do to a man and a community. They also learned to accept something that was so misunderstood, mysterious and feared for so long and gained a friend in the process.",
510,19 September 2010,sartor03,10, Still a classic 20 years after I first watched it!,"I first watched 'To Kill a Mockingbird' when I was about ten. At that time my big hero was John Wayne who would normally be the good guy that would gun down the baddies. Yes, there were the offerings of right and wrong in these films and were, as ever, compounded by violence, which was,as it is now, an attraction TKAB has it's hero in the guise of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), a lawyer in a racially divided Alabama town. To me, at my tender age, this character became a different hero who portrayed strength and conviction without violence or aggression. I was continually drawn in by Peck's wonderful performance as the Lawyer Finch. The guidance, patience and moralising he offers to his young motherless children, Jem and Scout. His display of unwavering duty in the face of adversity whilst preparing to defend a young black man who is accused of rape. Also,Finch offers great restrain in situations that would have given John Wayne the right hump. All in all, I was able to take on board the goodness of this character, not in a 'Goody-Goody' sense, but seeing another way of being tough and strong. There are good performances from Phillip Alford and Mary Badham who play Jem and Scout. They are central to the whole story and their characters offer a blend of honesty, naivety and adventure not to mention a strong sense of curiosity, particularly concerning the goings on involving their father who they continuously refer to as Atticus. I saw the film for a third time just recently, and loved it just as much as when I first saw it. I would also recommend the book by Harper Lee on which the film is based.",
511,2 January 2011,laurence-lodge,10, A breath of thoughtful air..,"To Kill a Mockingbird has become my favorite trial movie ever. I usually hate old style movies, but this movie is great. It is based on American history, and it gives historical information about how discrimination was unfair to black people. I was so sad when I finished the movie, and I saw it three times, over and over. This was my first black and white movie that became my favorite. I like most parts of this movie. I like the setting of this film, because it describes small towns of the 1930's, but it was so different that I was amazed in my mind. I thought it is really old living condition and old fashion. Also, Atticus was riding a car. I thought it was great. When I was in Korea, I saw movies and Thought the America has two story houses and have nice garden. And second thing I liked the actresses. My favorite one was Scout  Finch, because when I see her in the film I always think of my old friend, that I was a kid that really close to me. Also, this movie shows a lot of detail about the judgment and trial. Most of I liked the sound one the film. The sound makes me feel scare and sad. I remember that sound, when Atticus loses his trial. I love the actor Gregory peck as Atticus Finch, because they're look similar persons, Autticus was smart and courtly man, and so is Gregory Peck. I think it was good casting for Atticus Finch. Gregory Peck is dead now, but I saw the TV show of The 1991 Kennedy Center Honor. I can see his gentle and courtly manner also. On the TV show the violinist Issac Stern introduced him as a courtly man he also has a good relationship with his friends. Now that I have seen the show, I feel honor toward Gregory Peck. Most parts of this movie are great, but if I could change some, I would change the black and white to color I think that will be more beautiful view of Maycomb. It would be more interesting. Also, I think the story goes so fast, when I read the book, it had more detail in it. I think the movie skips some information about Scout, how she was smart. Also, I disliked sound, but it was very old, so if they change to the new sound, it would be more interesting. My user rating is `9' because I like most part s of this movie, but the story was little different than a book, also I like book better. They skip some part in the book. but it was pretty good . Later if they make new version of this movie, I would positively watch it. I think this movie is the great movie that I have ever watched, In the school.",
512,12 January 2004,xxjihyeyamxx,9," ""This movie become my favorite""","Before I watched To Kill A Mockingbird I thought that all the people have the same rights, but then I changed my mind. To Kill A Mockingbird is set during the 1930s. It develops a lot of different themes such as education, prejudice, and social class. The theme that impacted me the most was racism; that is why I changed my thoughts about equality. I love how the movie describes the trial of Tom Robinson with Gregory Peck as his lawyer, Atticus Finch. I liked a lot of things about To Kill A Mockingbird. The characters are like the book describes them. My favorite movies are suspense (mystery) movies, so I love the mystery of Boo Radley because I didn't know what really happened to him or how he really is. The case of Tom Robinson was the theme I liked the most because just for prejudice among white people toward black people, a good man was tried. Also, I liked all the history of the Finch family, and the life of each member, because each one had different thoughts and feelings. Finally, my favorite character was Scout Finch because she was a smart, strong girl, who tells the story with innocence and love. Although the movie was beautiful, there are some things I would change in the film, To Kill A Mockingbird. The character that I dislike was Aunt Alexandra because she always was criticizing Scout. She just looks at what Scout wears instead of looking at her feelings and thoughts. The worst character of the movie was Boo Ewell because he doesn't care about his children, he puts an innocent man on trial, and he tries to kill Scout and Jem. Also, I dislike Ms. Caroline Fisher because she was very rude with Scout, instead of feeling proud of her, she told her to stop reading at home. Gregory Peck is a wonderful actor, as Atticus Finch. He looks the same as the book, a man who shows empathy and courage. He shows empathy because he doesn't judge the people by their social class, and courage because he takes the case of Tom Robinson. He is the best lawyer; he doesn't care what the others say. He is a colossal man, big and extraordinary as the father of the family. Gregory Peck was an excellent actor; he showed his life through his movies. On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate the film, To Kill A Mockingbird, with an 8. The film is the same as the book, and develops all the themes. For example, the theme of prejudice is developed through the case of Tom Robinson. Also, the setting is like the book describes it, Maycomb, 1930. Although the movie was very good, I think it lacks special features such as color, music, and background. Also, the movie skips some parts of the book. For example, when Atticus went to Tom Robinson's house to tell his wife he died, in the book he went with Calpurnia but in the film he went with Jem. To Kill A Mockingbird is an excellent movie. According to the American Film Institute, it is one of the 34th best movies of all time. It is a story that maintains suspense from the beginning until the end. When any person starts watching, they can't stop seeing it because it is an amazing film. Also, the movie helps people to understand",

The movie enumerates the lives of people ostracised in the society. Court room scenes also show the attention seeking behaviours of the society and the weakness of jury system and it's susceptibility to bias. However child characters keep the audience intrigued.

Many aspects of the novel were portrayed in a ""screen friendly"" way, to show more of the action, and to display the main motives of each character. For example, the Radley house was accompanied by the use of sound effects to personify the character of Boo and Arthur Radley. The film was well-written, and well directed. The director, Robert Mulligan, chose wisely the actors of the film, Mary Badham, who played Scout, showed the personality of the young Finch very well, and Phillip Alford, who played Jem Finch, brought out the age difference between the Finch children. The film begins, showing the quiet town of Maycomb, which was an obvious choice by Mulligan, to show that Maycomb was like any other town at the time of the movie. The movie was set around the 1930's, and involved the Finches fighting for the freedom of Tom Robinson, a Negro accused of raping young Mayella Ewell.

525,12 April 2015,thomascarrcc,10, Great Movie!,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a story that encompasses the racial issues of its time. Although it is a serious and, ""grown up"" topic, the movie is easy to follow and relate to for all ages. Atticus Finch is a well-to-do lawyer, who goes against social norms by representing a black man, (Tom Robinson) who is falsely accused of rape. There is dramatic irony in the sense that the audience is aware that Tom is innocent, but people in Alabama don't want to believe it. This is a gut-wrenching factor, as you can feel nothing but sympathy for the mistreatment this innocent man faces. I find the most moving part of this film to be the morals that Atticus works to implement on his children Scout & Jem. Although they are growing up in a highly segregated era, they are open-minded and kind to all who are kind to them, regardless of the stereotypes surrounding them. The movie does an excellent job reflecting the time period, through the use of derogatory language and clear separation of the races. For example, in the courthouse, blacks mustn't sit on the first floor. Instead, they are to watch from the balcony. Moreover, the most obvious example of separation is the fact that Tom Robinsons guilt is hardly questioned. And although the defense does an excellent job exposing the true culprit, Tom's ethnicity is enough to label him a rapist.",
526,13 April 2015,samanthaswetzcc,8, Touching story that will bring you back to the troubles of the time,This is the greatest movie ever made based on the greatest book ever written. I was 16 and convinced by JFK and Camelot that we could change the world. I read the book over and over until it fell apart and then I bought a new one.,
527,7 December 2005,bthomas4,10, The best book and movie ever,"This is by far one of the best movies I have seen. It's real great for older kids. Some scenes are violent (Bob Ewell hurts Jem and gets in a fight with Boo, Bob Ewell with Jem around ),but some are sweet (Boo and Scout walking together) but,I think it's good for older kids. I is packed with history, too. Gregory Peck is a classic! Jem, Scout, Calpurnia,Miss Maudie,Boo, Bob Ewell, Mayella, and the others are wonderfully portrayed. Some parts in the book are not in the movie, but you can't fit it all in 2 hours. My sister whines that the acting wasn't that good, but I think it was great. My mom said Scout smiled some when she shouldn't.",
528,24 December 2015,heartofassisi,10, Great,"I saw this film for the first time in my late 20's and wasn't sure if I would like it without any major special effects or huge production costs. What I found was a story about morality and justice and the fact that justice isn't always done. This film touched me in many ways and showed how one honorable man can make a difference in the world. This film was made before the civil rights movement really took off in America and yet takes a great stand for the rights of the individual. The fact that the story is told from the perspective of Atticus Finch's daughter was a great twist. The mixture of real life problems with the wonders of a child's summer vacation give this film a great ""American"" feel. I highly recommend this film.",
529,27 August 2005,cmustain,9, What a great film,"It is not shocking that To Kill a Mockingbird is an Academy Award winning movie title. To Kill a Mockingbird is a classical movie that is set in early 1930's in Maycomb, Alabama. The film directed by Robert Mulligan is based on the novel by Harper Lee. The main character Atticus Finch, is a lawyer with two children, Jean Louise (Scout) and Jeremy (Jem). In one of the early scenes, Atticus is approached by Judge Taylor and is appointed to defend Tom Robinson, an African American who is accused of raping Mayella Violet Ewell. Due to Atticus taking the Tom Robinson case, a large amount of townspeople backlash because Atticus was defending a black man. Soon after the verdict is given by the jury claiming Tom Robinson guilty, Robinson is shot and killed by an officer. Atticus then goes to break the news to the Robinson family when Bob Ewell shows up and spits in Atticus' face. Ewell does this to show he picked the wrong side while defending Tom. This makes the main conflict in the film the racial issues of the town. Atticus tells his kids that ""it is a sin to kill a mockingbird."" Mockingbirds are harmless and innocent, just like Tom who did not attack anyone. The similarities between Atticus' description of a mockingbird and Tom's actions make him the town's mockingbird. In the film, a major theme is the Destruction of Innocence because the innocent mockingbird is killed. The narrative of To Kill a Mockingbird is organized in first person with Scout telling the story as an adult. It is shown that Scout is the narrator when the movie starts with ""Maycomb was a tired old town, even in 1932 when I first knew it."" Having the story being told from Scout's point of view, just as is in the novel, shows that the screenwriter and director decided to use segmentation in order to make the movie a story. The central characters in the film are Atticus, Scout, Jem, Mayella, and Bob. The central characters are a mix of heroes and villains. Atticus is the hero to his children because he showed them how to respect all people through taking and completing the case. He is also a hero to the Robinson family for doing all that he could to help their Tom. Bob Ewell is a villain not only to the Robinson family for framing Tom but also to Scout and Jem for attacking them while they were walking home from school. The heroes have actions that help others. For example, throughout the Ewell vs. Robinson case Atticus went above and beyond to protect Tom. However, the villain's actions cause harm to others. Ewell does nothing but hurt people beginning with Tom and his family and ending with Scout and Jem. To Kill a Mockingbird does not follow the classic form of crisis followed by resolution because the main conflict in the film, the Robinson vs. Ewell case, does not go the way Atticus wished.",
530,27 September 2016,io-72205,9, To Kill a Mockingbird,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. It is definitely in my top 5 favorite films of all time. I was the age Scout is in ""To Kill a Mockingbrid"" when this movie came out and it totally captivated me. I could identify somehow with the characters in the movie, their childhood fears and curiosity. Since ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" my favorite style of movie has always been one with a narrator. Gregory Peck became the actor I most admired because of his role as Atticus. The book later became my all time favorite. Interesting that Boo Radley was one of Robert Duvall's first film roles.",
531,22 July 2006,elovato,10, One of my all time favorite movies!,"I recently read the book, and watched the film, in my English class. I think that this movie is one of the most influential movies of all times. This movie shows the importance of equality, and made me realize how cruel our society really is. Harper Lee, the author of the novel, has a very unique writing style and makes the reader become part of the story. The characters are original and lovable. This movie was an amazing movie with an even more amazing cast. I enjoyed this movie because it was an influential movie for its time, and still is today. I don't think that it was as good as the book itself, but still got the authors point across by adding more comedy, more drama, and more conflict. I enjoyed this film/novel, and I hope that you enjoy it as well.",
