0,20 March 2017,mark.waltz,10, One of the great theatrical examples of what makes for superb drama.,"Theater at its best is practically impossible to get down on film correctly. When Hollywood gets it right, they create a work of art. In this case, they did it simply, without frills, casting actors who looked real and fell into their individual parts like kids into a swimming pool on a hot summers day. It's the hottest day of the year, and these twelve men must decide the fate of an accused killer. But twelve men means twelve personalities, twelve temperaments, twelve political views, twelve religious opinions and twelve preconceived notions. As the temperature swells, so does the temperament.

1,31 January 2020,henriquelrf,10, Dont judge by the age!,"For a while I was not very receptive to watching films that were too old. I always thought it would be difficult to get involved in the context, I couldn't be more wrong! 12 angry men, is a great example of how a simple film can do magic with good actors, and what great actors they are!",r
2,29 December 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, Terrific drama with some of the greatest actors in cinematic history,"Gosh, I don't know how many times I studied this play and performed it in high school, not to mention how many television shows had an episode that was inspired by 12 Angry Men. It was always a great drama because of the raw human emotions that were so true and remain timeless, this play will never be dated. I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw it at the video store and it was the first movie I slipped into the DVD player. First off, I was incredibly impressed with the credits, we not only had Henry Fonda, we had Lee J. Cobb in the cast! This movie was so well performed and such a treasure, god, I couldn't ever say any words to justify it. I've done this a million times, but here is another summary of what 12 Angry Men is all about.",e
3,10 June 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!!","There are a few wonderful courtroom dramas out there, Anatomy of a Murder, To Kill a Mockingbird and Witness for the Prosecution immediately springing to mind. 12 Angry Men is so brilliant, it could very well be the definitive courtroom drama on film. Sidney Lumet's direction is masterly, and although the action takes place on one set(an actual New York drawing room) there are a huge variety of innovative camera angles and visual set-ups. The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. Henry Fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Lee J Cobb, Rudy Bond et al. are all impeccable support to Fonda. Overall, brilliant courtroom drama. 10/10 Bethany Cox",v
4,21 October 2019,kosmasp,10, Classic in every sense and moment and frame,"I could go on, but I thought I'd stop there before my summary line gets too big. Now just because this is a classic movie (and we really should try to use that term lightly, but this movie really deserves it and I'll elaborate on that), does not mean everybody will love it. And if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. They just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn't it? The asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering.",i
5,1 July 2000,vukodlak,10, Excellent,"An excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. Instead of following the trial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. The film begins with the end of the trial. The jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is taken and the result is 11:1 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror #8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. But not everyone is easy to convince.",e
6,23 October 2004,juho69,9, Simple but great.,"'12 Angry Men' is an outstanding film. It is proof that, for a film to be great, it does not need extensive scenery, elaborate costumes or expensive special effects - just superlative acting.",w
7,11 January 2005,Freddy_Levit,10, Should be in everyone's top ten list of greatest films of ALL TIME.....,"........Films rarely get this uplifting and brilliant. I cannot think of the last time I was so intrigued by the flawless plot, dialogue and acting since 12 Angry Men. For such a simplistic story set in one jury room, it is surprising that Sidney Lumet can drain you of all your emotions and leave you on the edge of your seat with suspense, mystery, and some of the best acting your bound to ever see grace the silver screen!",/
8,13 April 2007,planktonrules,10, An absolute must for anyone who considers themselves a film buff,"This is one of the greatest films ever made...period. Much of this can be attributed to the exceptional writing and much of this can be attributed to the amazing performances in one of the best ensemble casts in film history. In fact, anyone who considers themselves a film buff or a serious student of film cannot say so unless they have seen this film. I also wish all young directors and writers were forced to watch the film as it demonstrates the power of excellent writing and acting. Imagine...a film that is great that does NOT have special effects, was filmed in black and white, and 99% of which takes place in one small room.",r
9,18 September 2002,Andrew Devonshire,10," No bombs, no car chases but edge of the seat stuff none the less","This film is superb, in fact as Shakespeare once said ""Its the bees' knees"". The film captivates the audience from the beginning.  Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.",w

11,22 September 2005,Thelightbulb,10," If you only ever see one Black and White movie, make this it.","I watched this film for the first time, when it was shown at about 1 o'clock in the morning. I made an effort to see it as it is rated as one of the best movies ever made, however I must admit that I watched it with a sense of reluctance as I'm not a great one for old ""classics"". This film blew me away however; how ignorant can I be about old films? How many other pre-1960s gems are there out there that I haven't seen? What strikes me most about this film is how progressive it is for its day. Indeed the issues this film makes about American society of the 1950s, still ring true for western society today. This film concerns twelve jurors debating the sentence of an 18 year old Puerto Rican boy who on the face of it, has no real alibi. However one man, played brilliantly by Henry Fonda, is ill-at ease putting a young boy to death without even debating his case, much to the despair of the other jurors. What follows is a brilliant piece of film making, slowly revealing many of the juror's complex characters to the audience as they react to Fonda's concerns with their own mix of metal scars, prejudices and insecurities. What especially struck me about this film is how ordinary most of the characters are, none of the jurors are shown to be especially bad men, indeed most are portrayed as honest everyman type people. The use of ordinary characters is the films master-stroke because as one by one they begin to question their initial instincts, the flaws of society that have let this Puerto Rican boy down are presented to the audience. Tragically it appears that many of the issues that were beginning to be discussed in the 1950s have only got worse. For me there is one immortal comment in this film: one of the jurors, a man in his 50s says that the youths of today have no respect and have changed so much for the worse since his day. How ironic is it that some grumpy old men of today who may not even of have been born when this films was made, still say exactly the same thing? Finally a quick look at the cast shows that Fonda aside many of the cast were only moderately successful after this film. I think that's a shame as everyone of these actors is excellent and plays their part in making it one of the best films of all time. However within the cast there are a couple of treats; look out for Jack Klugman (Quincy) and John Fieldler who is the voice of many of Disney's characters such as Piglet. I urge you all, if you have not yet seen this film, please do so now.",0
12,25 February 2019,FrenchEddieFelson,10, 2 thumbs up!,"I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and each time, I remain speechless in front of such a masterpiece. An unforgettable acting game with poignant plot twists. Awesome!",0
13,8 February 2022,Xstal,9, Birds of a Feather...,"A room of jurors take their seats, deliberate; a young man's future on the line, his life at stake; twelve white middle aging men, show us time and time again, what diversity and difference helps negate.",5
14,7 February 2022,CubsandCulture,10, Juror #4 is why this is a great film,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.",0
15,6 August 2005,lee_eisenberg,10, I find this movie guilty of being a masterpiece.,"Shot in real time, this story of a jury trying to decide whether a young man is innocent or guilty never lets the viewer's attention go. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8, who is convinced the entire time that the defendant is innocent, while everyone else has already called him guilty. Throughout the movie, we not only get to hear everyone's opinions on the matter, but also every possibility of the verdict. With ""12 Angry Men"", Sidney Lumet brought to the screen the same kind of ""closing in"" feeling that he brought to movies like ""Network"". In the end, the issue is not whether the defendant is innocent or guilty; the important point is the process by which the jurors reached their decision. This may be THE perfect movie.",5
16,24 April 2019,navidveradi,10, Masterpiece!,"The only thing I can write as an average Joe who watches movies simply to be entertained or see a story being told, is that I watched 12 Men argue in a room for more than an hour and I couldn't look away from the screen. Simply a masterpiece!",7
17,1 September 2003,jomipira,9," Good script, great dialogs and a set of actors who would be the envy of the world","This is one of those movies where everything could go wrong. The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word ""go"". The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movie and draw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie. A must see for everyone.",/
18,30 July 2011,classicsoncall,9," ""You can't send someone off to die with evidence like that"".","When I was a store manager for a regional supermarket chain, about thirty years or so ago, our team was presented a developmental seminar featuring ""12 Angry Men"". Breaking into work groups, our task was to watch the film, and at strategically paused moments, predict which of the jurors would be the next to change their verdict from guilty to not guilty. It was an exercise in analytical thinking and observation of human behavior, characteristics that a good manager needs in order to develop a work force toward a common goal. There was actually a group that got all the positions right from one through twelve, which astounded me. Watching today, I got stuck again right at the outset, figuring Jack Klugman's Juror #5 would be the first to be influenced by Henry Fonda's argument.",?
19,31 January 2020,gcanfield-29727,10, The only version to see.,"In my opinion, the best movie ever made. Brilliant performances all around. A whole lot of dialogue, but you never get tired of listening. Lumet's first film-what an amazing talent. Henry Fonda and Lee J Cobb stand out, but all are excellent. There was a prior TV version, which is horrible. Lumet's version is the only one to see.",r
20,8 April 2022,marcelbenoitdeux,10, Gripping and Irresistable,"1957! 65 years ago and look at it, just look at it. This is Sidney Lumet's first feature film, up to this moment he had built his reputation on television. This was also the only film that Henry Fonda ever produced. He must have trusted Sidney Lumet very much and God was he right. Lumet concocts a masterful, choreographic coup. Within the four wall of the jury room the sense of claustrophobia, propels the drama forward in such a way that it's enough to catch a few minutes of the film to be totally hooked. Henry Fonda is superb and the rest of the cast a who's who of New York stage actors. From Jack Warden to Jack Klugman, from Lee J Cobb to E G Marshall. In my book, flawless.",e
21,17 March 2019,ElJimbooo,10, 12 men in a room. Genius.,"In my opinion, 12 Angry Men is the greatest film that has ever been created.

24,4 January 2014,ma-cortes,8, A top-notch cast under superb direction by Sidney Lumet makes this movie excellent in every aspect,"A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others (Jack Klugman , Martin Balsam , Jack Warden , Lee.

25,17 March 2003,misha-wilkin,8, A Classic not to be Missed,"The plot of12 Angry Men revolves around the murder trail of a Latino boy who is accused of killing his father. The conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boy's life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities. The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.",t

27,29 March 2020,cjyork-03423,10," Simple, yet brilliant","This film is investing from start to finish. None of the performances feel like actors playing characters, but instead as people who just happen to be being filmed. The dialogue is phenomenal, the camerawork is absolutely phenomenal, the heat and claustrophobia of the environment sets in right away and gradually gets more and more intense. This film is absolutely phenomenal, and I would recommend it to absolutely anybody who enjoys film as an art form.",u
28,2 June 2022,kevin_robbins,8, The acting is splendid and Fonda and Cobb's back and forth is very good.,12 Angry Men (1957) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a jury trying a case for murder where everyone agrees but one person. That one person discusses the case with the jury and explains why he doesn't agree based on the evidence. Will the jurors change their mind and align with the man or will it be a hung jury?,r

33,28 September 2006,ReelCheese,9," So Simple, So Brilliant","So simple yet so brilliant, 12 ANGRY MEN is not to be missed. It's the tale of the meticulous Mr. Davis, a juror not quite convinced of a murder suspect's guilt despite what appears to be overwhelming evidence. His questions gradually persuade his fellow jurors that things aren't always as open-and-shut as they might seem.",
34,8 February 2005,jotix100,10, Beyond a reasonable doubt,"Having seen the film before, we decided to take another look recently when it showed up on a cable channel. This Sidney Lumet 1957 film still packs a lot of power, even though times have changed in the way our justice system works. The screen play by Reginald Rose shows his brilliant insight into human beings that are called to sit as jurors in a murder case.",
35,6 March 2006,Quinoa1984,10, a tight ball of male-dominated classic cinema,"It's tough sometimes to translate a stage production- which 12 Angry Men essentially is- into a feature film, with in this case one cramped room and a dozen characters with totally varied ideals. In a way this is like the textbook example, however, of how to do a film like this. You see how the situation unfolds into something more, about the act of telling a story and finding all the pieces. That it has such a powerhouse of an ensemble doesn't hurt it at all, and the little surprises in how the casts acts and reacts works great on repeat viewings. The basic premise only needs brief mention, as the 12 men (totally angry may be disputed by some, though I'm sure not one is left without raising their voice), all white, are judging the case of a Hispanic charged with killing his father. The deliberation room becomes a kind of boiler room where Henry Fonda's juror #11, the only un-sure one, sets the stage for a something more to be revealed- human nature when on a judgment day, with all its intelligence, ignorance, hate, and seeking objectivism.",
36,1 July 2022,Xarx117,10, A Classic,"This movie is a very good example of what a good director can do with so little. Just the fact that everything happens in the same room is impressive. The details of the crime is only discussed, but it seems even more intterresting than if we would of actually seen it on screen. The characters are all played very well, the dialog is pretty good and the camera work is also really impressive for its time! Everything combined, this movie is simple but very good.",
37,24 April 2009,roghache,8," THE classic jury drama, compelling but not without flaws","This is surely the most famous film jury drama, quite riveting in its dialogue, its claustrophobic jury deliberation room setting, its brilliantly depicted characters, its atmosphere of oppressive heat and tension between these jurors. The twelve angry men are admittedly largely one dimensional stereotypes but they are brought vividly to life by a star studded cast including Henry Fonda, E.G. Marshall, Leo J. Cobb, and Jack Klugman.",
38,5 July 2005,evanston_dad,10, The All-Time Great Liberal Agenda Movie,"I defy anyone to watch this movie and not be completely absorbed in the group dynamics on display. I could take points off for the overly tidy and convenient script with its TV-movie ending or some of the less subtle methods through which director Sidney Lumet drives home his points. But with a cast as uniformly excellent as this, why quibble? Henry Fonda is just the person to play the liberal everyman, an extension of his Tom Joad character from ""The Grapes of Wrath."" E.G. Marshall is excellent as Fonda's most formidable opponent; cool-headed and logical, he's the only holdout who bases his verdict on facts instead of emotions. Lee J. Cobb's performance wears thin, and his character is the most poorly written. Ed Begley is almost too good in his role, so revolting is his character. Jack Klugman and Jack Warden register in smaller roles as well.",
39,8 March 2022,thomasgouldsbrough,10," ""Everyone has a breaking point""","12 Angry Men may be the greatest film of the 1950's. It really is unlike other films, as it's takes place in mostly 1 location, over an hour and a half, and there's no actions - just a conversation. The acting just feels so natural, almost like they improvised the entire film. All the characters are distinct, and very memorable, especially juror 8.",
40,17 February 2006,Hitchcoc,10, It Blends Together,"This movie came out of an era that I really loved, when ensemble acting was so strong. We had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. The direction by Sidney Lumet on this film is outstanding. To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human. It's the true whodunnit without Hercule Poirot. This is the element that is most obvious; that 12 men can sit in a single room for the entire movie and interact and still keep us totally occupied. Enough has been said about this. I just wish that contemporary film making could take a bit more from these masterpieces; let the fine actors that we have do their individual things.",
41,13 November 2005,moonspinner55,8," A bit overwrought, over-directed, but compelling nonetheless...","Twelve-man jury decides the fate of a young man on trial for murder; eleven think the kid is guilty, the twelfth isn't so sure. Director Sidney Lumet makes his directorial debut here, and he's overly fond of riled-up actors shouting at the camera, but he doesn't stray from the proved path of this celebrated play by Reginald Rose, and that's a plus (the material stands quite well on its own). The claustrophobic, muggy atmosphere is rife with tension, and Henry Fonda is a tower of sanity as the only voice of reason. The film attempts to substitute the electricity of a live performance with too many tight shots of angry, sweaty faces, spitting and yelling, however this ensemble cast has a rich anti-camaraderie that puts the film across. *** from ****",

50,23 May 2007,thinker1691,10, The Lonely Juror,"One does not expect an ordinary black and white movie like ""Twelve Angry Men"" to set the foundation for great drama. Nevertheless, superior drama is what is delivered in this film. The setting is; a common courtroom in an eastern metropolitan city where twelve ordinary men have been selected to sit as a jury. The trial is over and the verbal testimony having been heard, the jury must now decide the fate of the young man on trial for his life. A common enough occurrence in America. But what is not common, is the mixed assortment of characters assembled for the jury. The real drama unfolds when a single juror (Henry Fonda) takes his task seriously and challenges each of his fellow members to think and then decide before they vote for the death penalty. When he does, the volatile reaction is nothing short of inspirational. One can only wish the same would happen to anyone facing a similar ordeal. The cast of characters is a vintage performance from all. Henry Fonda's performance is wonderful and courageous. He is joined by veterans actors, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber. The honor of Classic fits this film like a velvet glove. *****",

Murder is one of the oldest crimes in this world but murder of your own father is something astonishing. The movie is about a teenager accused of murdering his own father in an open case where all the indictments and witnesses are against him. The jury is called for verdict, and all of them are unanimously agreed on conviction. But one of the juror thinks to contemplate a bit on witnesses before giving a verdict as a life of teenager is on line, and from there the true brilliance of this movie begins as the way juror # 8 (Henry Fonda) unfolds all the witnesses are based on assumptions and anticipations . The way he demonstrates the happening of incident based on accusation is one of the true essence of this movie and in the end all jurors are convinced that ""No guilty"" is right verdict to be passed. The way story moves is marvelous ostentation of director Sidney Lumet's true brilliance. The movie is nicely written by Reginald Rose and is beautifully portrayed by all the actors especially Henry Fonda and Lee J Cobbs. This movie is truly a masterpiece and its impression will not be easy to diminish.",

59,19 November 2013,ironhorse_iv,9, 12 Angry Men doesn't made me angry. It makes me think. It's one good movie.,"12 Angry Men is one of the best plays turn into movies films ever. 12 Angry Men was adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose by director Sidney Lumet. There is no music score, no action scenes, no sex appeal, but this movie is one of the best, due to two reasons: great writing, and great acting. One thing that I love about this movie is how little locations there are in this film. Beside the opening scene, most of the film takes place in a room made up of 12 men jury as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. They must stay there, until they can be make a unanimous decision. To add to the pressure, the room goes from hot and humid to warm, and cold, making each character go through a chain full of emotions. The way, the film is filmed is amazing. It shot in a way that makes the room feel a bit claustrophobia. Since there is a lack of locations, the character of the film had to be very interesting people, and they were. Like the title says, 96 minutes of the movie is pure intense arguments between a group of men whose personalities ranges from quiet and good-hearted to outright anger and hate. None of the jury members have their real names mention, as most are refers to each other by a number given to them beforehand. When you think about it, nobody name was used in the film; the defendant is referred to as ""the boy"" and the witnesses as the ""old man"" and ""the lady across the street"". The film use anonymity as a way to make the film more a general representation of America. These are everyday people that could very well be on your jury. This sense of anonymity raises the stakes of the play as a social drama, in that is a more general commentary of our society. Who were these men is still a mystery? We only get a glimpse of what they do in their real life. They soon become acquainted with the personalities of each other and want to vote. Some of these men believe that the young teen killed his father in a fit of rage but only one juror, Juror Number 8 (Henry Fonda) is not certain beyond a reasonable doubt that the young boy did it and felt they should talk more about it. The jury soon came head to head with clashing of arguments and questioning of the evidence. Without spoiling too much about it, I have to say the heated discussion of evidences is the best part of the film as find out more about the true personalities of the jury members. All the actors did a great job. Henry Fonda does a great job as Juror 8, as the lone man wanting to convince his peers to evaluate the matter beyond their initial, largely emotion-based judgments to determine what the kid really did do. He does this, by explaining the murder weapon and the faults of the two witnesses. Still, I doubt, even in 1950's standards, a jury member can carry a knife in a jury room. Ed Begley as Juror Number 10 is chilling as the loudmouth racist whom based on the locality where the accused lived. Lee Cobb as Juror #3 is painted as a father who allows his poor relationship with his own son to influence his judgment of the case gives one hell of a performance. Last, worth noting is Jack Warden as Number 7, a sport fan who cares more about a baseball game than the case that he is given. While the others jurors members, are interesting characters, none of them were as great as these 4 men who brings the best out of this play. Throughout the play, we see two opposing views of justice which I love. The two-sided nature of justice create tension and contrast the characters. Each character wants ""justice,"" but what justice becomes unclear and fluid throughout the course of the play. If I can find one fault in the film is how the movie makes Henry Fonda seem like the protagonist and everybody else the antagonist. We don't know if Juror 8 is right and yet, his actions are framed as an act of bravery, standing up against the group to do what's right. In the end, of the film in a chilling reverse of roles, Juror 3 is view as a stubborn man, refusing to come over to the side of reason. What's really interesting about the case within 12 Angry Men is that we never ultimately find out for sure whether the accused is guilty or innocent. It's up to question. People even today, still have open debate about if the boy did the crime or not. In modern terms, most likely the results would happen, is a mistrial assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed. It's one of the few movies that make you think. The film should be view by anybody going to Law, but not only that, but regular people in general. Yes, the film is a bit outdated, and younger people might not want to see a black and white film with old men yelling at each other, but I think once they mature enough, they would find this movie great as well. If not, this movie. They can watch the 1997's remake of 12 Angry Men. That version is also pretty well done. There is a lot of things that people can learn from this film, like issuing dealing with class, racism, family relationships, psychology and communications. It's really hard to hate this film. The more years pass by, the more praise it gets.",

Thot it was jus chatting n no action. Saw it again in 9th grade n found it to be totally engaging n character driven movie. Saw again in 2005 n then again few days back on a DVD. 12 Angry Men is a film that has aged incredibly well, offers fantastic performances, fantastic dialogues and a film that can be watched over and appreciated more and more each time. This movie shows in a marvelous simple way the mechanism of the justice system, how easily a man can be convicted to the death sentence based on prejudice, subjective declarations of witnesses and an unprofessional defense lawyer. Everything is good about this film. The screenplay by Reginald Rose (The wild geese, Escape from sobibor) is top notch. The direction by Lumet (Dog day aftnoon, Network, The verdict ) is excellent. It must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but Lumet does it superbly and the camera work is awesome. All the actors really got into the skin of the character n they portrayed their moods n emotions very well. Henry Fonda (The grapes of wrath, Once upon a time in the west, The longest day) n Lee J.

As we all know the action is virtually confined to the Jury Room in the wake of a murder trial to which we are not privy. It seems open and shut and eleven of the jurors are ready to vote guilty and get out of there but one man persuades them to at least consider the possibility that the accused is innocent. Eventually all twelve jurors vote not guilty, end of story. BUT: It they are correct then WHO did kill the victim? Presumably the police never bothered to search for anyone else so is there a murderer on the loose? Conversely, what if the accused really IS guilty, then they have conspired to let a murderer walk free. Clearly this began life as a play for television for which its single set is ideal and the transformation to the big screen is masterly. All twelve actors are beyond praise and this is, without question, a truly fine film, yet a film that tackles moral questions so forthrightly should itself be questioned by ignoring others.",

It shows the group-dynamics of 12 people, the jury, trying to decide if there is ""reasonable doubt"" concerning whether a young boy killed his father. The discussions are tense and little by little we learn from these what supposedly happened on that night the kids father died. We are therefore also drawn into the question of whether the boy did it or not ourselves and what at first seems like a clear cut case along the way becomes all of a sudden much more complicated. It is a film that dares to handle nuances and ambiguities (we are never certain of whether the boy did it or not) in a way we rarely see. Its also a movie that lets us watch these 12 angry men discuss in the same room for a full 96 minutes without it ever getting boring, which I have to respect; you really have to thrust your material to let a whole movie consist of a discussion.",

And shining through it all is the oh so good man who has right, justice, and the American way on his side.

The way the jurors talk as they enter the jury room it sounds like an open and shut case; they call for a quick vote before any discussions take place; eleven men say he is guilty, but one dissents. Juror Eight explains that he doesn't necessarily believe that the accused, an eighteen year old slum boy, is innocent but he won't allow him to be executed without the jurors even discussing the evidence. On the face of it the evidence is compelling; the accused bought a knife just like the murder weapon a couple of weeks previously, the woman across the railway line says she looked out of the window and saw the killing, the man below says he heard the accused shout 'I'm going to kill you' before hearing the body fall and seeing the accused leave the building. Gradually they look at each piece of evidence in turn and as doubts are raised the number of 'not guilties' increases but some jurors are adamant that they just know he did it; to get an acquittal prejudices must be overcome too.",

And there is one thing that I noticed about this film. Everything great is because of the writing. The acting, Emotions, Characters, Plot, personal self-enjoyment, and even the cinematography are all vastly improved by the writing. The acting is excellent but without such a great script all of it would seem unrealistic. For example, see some of the scenes in the star wars prequels. I believe that some of the people who acted in them were good actors but had horrible dialogue written by George Lucas that made their acting look awful. For example, I haven't seen it but Hayden Christensen is known for having a great performance in the film ""Shattered Glass"" Made in 2003 but since his most popular films are badly written, he is known as a bad actor. This films writing however made all of these actors well known for being some of the best of their time.",

What we are left with is cinema in its purest form, where acting is the sole driving-force of the narrative, and our attention is retained through the director's thorough exploitation of a bare-bones scenario. Sidney Lumet's debut feature-length film, '12 Angry Men (1957),' is quite simply one of the most arresting motion pictures I have ever seen, a veritable melting pot of gripping performances and impassioned monologues. With the exception of its bookends, and a brief scene in an adjacent washroom, the entire film unfolds exclusively within the one stifling, increasingly-claustrophobic jury room, as a group of twelve jurors {all male, mostly middle-aged and middle-class}, with vastly differing attitudes and prejudices, debate the innocence or guilt of a young Hispanic man charged with the premeditated stabbing murder of his father.",

It only takes one very strong, articulate and confident juror to be able to convince the other 11. None of them are trained. It's all pretty much based on gut feeling. And most of us are sheep. Even though I've always thought - via my untrained instinct - that the jury system was fundamentally flawed, I've never really seen it challenged in film or conveyed in such a powerful way as 12 angry men did. Not only was the film entertaining on a theatrical level, it also rings true today. Is there a better system to judge guilt or innocence? I don't know. But this film demonstrates that the current system (bear in mind this was released in 1957) is anything but foolproof. A thought provoking yet entertaining 8 out of ten",

131,9 March 2018,TheMovieDiorama,10, 12 Angry Men proves that a masterpiece is all in the details.,"Released in 1957, this is about a group of jurors deciding the fate of a young boy who is accused of murder. One man believes he is not guilty and attempts to convince the rest of the jurors of his innocence. This is, without a doubt, one of the best dramas ever created. Nice short runtime, small cast, all filmed in one room...it's just so tight!! The beauty of it is that just from dialogue alone we are thoroughly entertained and it maintains a sense of tension throughout. The crime is never re-enacted, it's from the descriptive dialogue that we picture it in our heads. Writer Reginald Rose knew that the most powerful tool in film (at that time) was words. The cast was high calibre, Henry Fonda leading the view of not guilty...it's pretty difficult to go against him when he is full of suaveness and so convincing. We get to know each juror as the film goes on and we soon start to explore the possibility that their personal lives are tainting their decision. That, was what made it so palpable. It was clouding their judgement, and their stubborn personalities made it all the more satisfying if they did change their mind. Persuasion is a powerful tool, but add a hint of conviction and you can manipulate anyone's mind. Several nice details were included, I like the fact it was set on the hottest day of the year. The heat evidently getting to the jurors, it made them more irritable and heightened the angry emotions within. Director Sidney Lumet did so much in such a little space, technically. When the jurors enter the room, its a sublime long five minute shot and he manages to share the screen time with each juror equally. He was able to convey their personalities instantaneously just by their attire, then when the discussion commences we start to dig a little deeper. The screenplay really is the winner here, if anything it makes me want to work in law! Dramas do not come better than this, 12 Angry Men easily gets the perfect rating. It sits in the inclusive list of masterpieces.",

This is not because I dislike the film, but because the director makes it seem so easily done, it makes you think you could do it yourself. The acting is a complete dream. Henry Fonda, E. G. Marshall, Martin Balsam and Robert Webber are exceptional. But the real star of the film is Lee J. Cobb. He immense's himself so completely into his role that its hard to believe that the movie isn't a documentary. The ending of the film, with that look on Lee J. Cobb's face is heart rendering.

135,25 February 2017,sb-47-608737,10, Brilliant Group dynamics,"I will not go in normal review of the movie. It had been brilliant. There were loopholes, but not in the plot, but in the prosecution. There are more than reasonable doubt of the boy being not guilty and he most certainly was, along with the points made by the defense (jurors) there were several other missed points, which the stories said, but weren't used for defense. The movie brilliantly brings out, when the cops wants to make a scapegoat of someone who doesn't have means to defend, how easily they can. The defense lawyer, as mentioned during discussions, was an unwilling completely disinterested and somehow wanted to go over the ordeal. Probably a case of 'Court Appointed' - a la ""You volunteer"" of An Officer And A gentleman. The glaring inconsistencies, which the juror noticed, and some they didn't were not noticed by him. However that isn't the brilliance of the movie, but it is its real life depiction of a upper echelon policy meeting, especially Board Meetings of a company. I am in a position vouch for that. Probably, if not already, this movie should be a part of mandatory curriculum of any business school. There the CEO has brought an agenda, ably supported by his/her team (the prosecutors). It is in Board, and usually the way it happens, all are very convinced of the power point presentation and the golden future the schemes will lead to. Unless one has a doubt and express it, the scheme will move on, till probably it is too late (boy past and beyond chair). ",

141,22 November 2014,Movie-ManDan,10, The Best Courtroom-Drama Ever Made!,"To Kill a Mockingbird garner the reputation as the best courtroom drama as it ranks the highest on most lists. It is a great film, I'll admit, but 12 Angry Men blows it out of the water. Funny thing is, this takes place in one room for 98% of the whole movie. There's about one minute in the actual courtroom in the beginning and one minute outside the building at the end. The rest is in the room where the jurors decide whether or not the defendant is guilty. When a movie takes place inside one room throughout the whole movie, the script has to be extremely strong and exciting. 12 Angry Men's script is those. It follows 12 very distinctive jurors who know that a Spanish-American youth murdered his father. All evidence gathered points to him, so all think that they can reach a guilty verdict right away. But Juror #8 (Fonda) is the only one that thinks the kid is innocent. One by one, Juror #8 convinces the eleven others that the young man is not guilty as they carefully analyze the evidence they were given. Each piece of evidence that is turned around is sheer genius and very thrilling. I actually consider this to be a courtroom- thriller because of how exciting it is. I found my heart rate rising at the site of each piece f the puzzle being put together. I could only imagine how this movie would have turned out if Alfred Hitchcock directed it. Fun fact: only two jurors' names are revealed at the very end, with the audience forgetting they do not know anybody else's names. Aside from this being very thrilling and educational, and having a great script and characters, it deals with themes of racism and family, as both play important roles on why the Jurors vote ""guilty"" in the first place.

Even though it is an older film, it is also a refreshing take on courtroom dramas. On the surface, this film is a pure drama about the courtroom, but it goes much, much deeper than that. I was discussing in an earlier review (Dial M for Murder) about the use of a single location. Well, this film inhabits that single location very much so, and the film is actually famous for that. Outside of three minutes, the film takes place in a single New York City courtroom. That works very well in this film takes to the expert directing by first-time director Sidney Lumet and veteran cinematographer Boris Kaufman. The film is expertly shot and the use of the focal length's shots allow the audience to feel more of each character's feelings. Lumet later discussed how a ""lens plot"" occurred to him. As the movie progressed, he changed the lenses to longer focal lengths, in order for the background to gradually close in on the characters. A very good technique I must point out.",

A suspect is freed when the prosecution hasn't made its case, not when the suspect is proved innocent. No one is ever declared ""innocent.""

These men are a cross-section of American and in particular New York society, circa 1957, and range from the working to the upper middle classes; from the highly sensitive to the appallingly crude; and from those who think they're smart and perceptive and often are not, to those who think little of themselves and who really ought to rate themselves more highly.

An example of this, is when Fonda successfully gets the others to acknowledge that the old man witness is unreliable, yet then goes on to base a major part of his own evidence on the old fellows testimony that he took fifteen seconds to get to the door to witness the murderer fleeing. Fonda clearly assumes that this man he has determined as unreliable would get his exact timings spot on in a moment of heightened emotion. It may seem like a minor point but there are just a little too many of these small inconsistent assumptions littering 12 Angry Men for me to feel it was an entirely successful exercise. I really couldn't help shake the notion that Fonda's character had his own agenda and was simply unwilling to back down. Perhaps he was the most persuasive man in the room and that was ultimately the reason that the decision was made. It's difficult to really say with any certainty that the accused was innocent at all.

While I wouldn't go so far as to call it one of the greatest of all time, it is a vastly entertaining take on a brilliant premise that has been used throughout the decades sense. The dialogue is sharp, the character turns are believable and interesting and the whole thing flows along at a swift pace. When it was over I couldn't believe that so much time had gone by. I'm always fascinated by films that take place entirely in one location (or almost entirely) and this was one of the early precedents for the kind of greatness one can accomplish when that is utilized properly.",

Set exclusively in a jury room, the film exceeds the four corners of its setting presenting themes with great depth and handle about politics, interpersonal relationship, prejudice, bias and hope.

168,1 August 2003,lllinggg,8, Masterpiece Nearing Perfection,"It has been described as ""flawless"", ""immaculate"" and ""supreme"" -and for good reason. '12 Angry Men' is an old Swiss golden clock in the age of Japanese digital watches, a Flemish renaissance mahogany armchair in the era of prefabricated furniture, a handcrafted motion picture at a time of processed film-making. Henry Fonda is the sole dissenting juror in a murder case, who utilizes rational methodology to convince the remaining eleven jurors that the accused is not guilty as charged. Filming almost exclusively in a small, nondescript jury deliberation room, director Sidney Lumet produces a masterpiece of American film-making, reaching the limits of structured cinematic delivery. The opening segment, which rolls uncut for over 10 minutes, is unparalleled, as is the dramatic sequence of the murder recreation. Assisted by an outstanding theatrical script, the film's cast members literally forget to act, allowing their roles as jurors to inhabit their conscience as they perform. Notably, E.G. Marshall (juror #4) splendidly captures the essence of his role as a prudent financier, while Lee J. Cobb (juror #3) writes cinematic history with his phenomenal portrayal of Fonda's leading adversary among the jury. Last but not least, the film's didactic quality is multifaceted, on the one hand illustrating how educated citizens can guide, rather than endure, the democratic process, and on the other hand illuminating how moral purpose and artistic dedication can guide a film's production in ways Hollywood creators often choose to neglect. Overall, a solid film that has earned the respect of successive generations of movie audiences.",

That's a fantastic accomplishment, especially if you consider this film is more than sixty years old, doesn't feature any computer-engineered special effects and hasn't got any geeky cult followings that dress up like the lead characters.

The acting is what makes this movie such a great one, Henry Fonda as the lone dissenter is magnificent, as are the rest of the jurors, particularly Lee J Cobb as the infamous volatile emotionally unstable juror number 3 and E.G Marshall as the cool and rational juror number 4 who judges on facts. The ending is wrapped in tension as the jury nears its unanimous verdict, and one feels a sense of relief when they reach it.

It is not because it's in black and white. It is because the setting is in one room. The majority of the movie is just in one room with the characters. This is definitely not a movie that uses special effects and other over the top props to make it engaging. What does make it engaging is the dialogue and performances by the characters. The majority of the movie is just these 12 men trying to make a verdict if a boy is guilty or not of a crime. At first, 11 of them all said he is totally guilty. But then one man wasn't to quick to judge and wants to argue it further. This then carries the rest of the movie so well and we learn a lot about these 12 men just arguing about the judgement of guilty or not guilty against an accused boy. The overall message which is still prevalent to today which is ""Don't judge until you get all the facts and have thought about the implications."" The writing and characters is all this movie needs to be good. Other movies could learn a lot from this one.",
174,15 May 2016,Sebastian_Conrad,9, 12 Angry Men: A Classic Work of Genius,"12 Angry Men is a 1957 American drama film with elements of film noir, adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Written and co-produced by Rose himself and directed by Sidney Lumet, this trial film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse followed by the judge's final instructions to the jury before retiring, two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, and a brief final scene on the courthouse steps, the entire film takes place in the jury room.

It's a great honor to see someone take a screenshot and quote this short comment 11 years ago as a vulgar mass representative. Now I would like to add that it is one thing to say that the dereliction of duty by the organs of power. There is no fault in reasonable questioning, but there is a fault in the verdict of acquittal.

212,5 June 2011,jboothmillard,9, 12 Angry Men,"I should start by saying that twelve is my favourite number, but it wasn't just because of that that I planned to see this film, I had heard many people state it is one of the finest films in the genre, from debuting Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Sidney Lumet (Murder on the Orient Express, Dog Day Afternoon). Basically the jury of twelve men (a jury is always twelve people) has just come from the courtroom after hearing the defence and prosecution rest their cases, and they are now the people who must decide the verdict for the case. They must determine if a young Spanish-American is guilty or not guilty of the first degree murder by stabbing of his father, and if they all unanimously agree to find him guilty he instantly gets sentenced to death. With a weak alibi of going out to the movies and not remembering what he saw, a knife he supposedly bought and lost, and a number of witnessed hearing screams, someone shouting the words ""I'm going to kill you"" and possible seeing it happen, it seems open and shut. All Jurors have immediately decided to vote guilty, one Juror however is voting not guilty until he clears up the facts, this is Mr. Davis, aka Juror #8 (BAFTA winning Henry Fonda, also producing). At first he is voting opposite to everyone else for the sake of conversation and discussion, deliberations however crop up and he slowly straightens things out and brings forward things that the defence, prosecution and ultimately witnesses may have missed. These include Juror #8 having the same knife as the boy and pondering the stabbing, the noises going on when the murder happened, the reason for the shouted words, the timing of the old man heading to answer the door, and most importantly, a key witness who chose not to wear glasses but marks on her nose prove she does. Slowly the Jurors, some wise, bright and empathetic, one or two arrogant, prejudiced and merciless, may be seeing that this lone Juror has some good points and brings forward some good ideas as to what may have happened. Juror #3 (The Exorcist's Golden Globe nominated Lee J. Cobb) and Juror #10 (Ed Begley) for a long while seem adamant to stick to their verdicts of guilty, but slowly the others: Juror #1 (Psycho's Martin Balsam), Juror #2 (John Fiedler), Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall), Juror #5 (Jack Klugman), Juror #6 (Edward Binns), Juror #7 (Being There's Jack Warden), Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney), Juror #11 (George Voskovec) and Juror #12 (Robert Webber), do start to doubt their decision is right. Being swayed by the very convincing predictions of the murder events, one by one the Jurors change their verdict to not guilty, until the final one sobbingly gives in, and in the end they all agree the boy should go free. Fonda gives a magnificent performance as the calm, collective and convincing lone voting Juror to turn the others decision, Cobb is equally fantastic as the one who takes ages to change the mind of, and the other actors all get their moments on screen as well. The one location film based on a play could have been a little dull, but director Lumet keeps you gripped with a marvellously worded script played out to perfection by the actors, with the addition of great camera work and set pieces as well, it is a brilliant classic courtroom drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Henry Fonda was number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Juror #8 was number 28 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 88 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 87 on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies, and it was number 42 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers.

Although the premise may sound completely boring for most people, the context in it surpasses most of everything out there. In a way it is a detective story that takes place in a confined room and where all evidence are based solely on speculations and thin reasoning. Through means of possibilities, deduction, and doubt, 12 men are supposed to decide the fate of a young man accused of killing his own father. Although the case seems crystal clear at first, as all the evidence prove his guilt, a single shred of doubt is more than enough to begin a long line of second thoughts and complicating debates. Anyone who loves intelligent disputes and exposed lines of thought behind anything will definitely be mesmerized by its attention to detail. ",

Although one can certainly take the message as having to do with inherent problems in having a death penalty as a rule of law, there is a deeper message still: does not justice, in a democratic society, demand of us to think clearly? to uncover and expunge our individual prejudices? to confront the enormous weight of responsibility as coolly and objectively as possible?

230,9 June 2010,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, Stunning,"This is one of the best films I have ever had the good fortune of watching. A jury is nearly convinced that the accused is guilty. One man stands against the rest and argues that he may not be. In the 90 minutes that follow, this goes into these twelve individuals, and we see how peer pressure and personal prejudices can sway decisions that ought not to be taken lightly. This is a masterpiece, and it is so on account of all the elements being carefully crafted, each excellent on their own, and the mix of them all being so seamless. Every character(they are the focus of this, if the well thought out case itself does get a lot of attention as well) and the script is well-written, developed impeccably and credible. This is quite realistic, and what flaws there are were possibly conscious decisions for the dramatic effect(it is not a documentary, nor was it meant to be), and do not take away from the whole. The acting is perfect for all concerned. This is carried by dialog and marvelous speeches, with no flashbacks and essentially only one setting(albeit the cinematography makes full use of it, so no claustrophobia is induced). The camera stays on the people, follows them, remains on them for reactions when someone else suddenly speaks, and there are long takes. Editing is impossibly subtle. You forget that it's a movie. Instead, you find yourself experiencing this tense situation with them. A dozen men in a locked room, determining if someone lives or dies. This raises questions about the legal system, as well. Other than Serpico, I haven't seen anything by Lumet, but Dog Day Afternoon is on my list of ones to get. There is some mildly disturbing content and a few instances of moderate language in this. The DVD comes with the original trailer. I recommend this to everyone. 10/10",

It was once said that two actors epitomized the average American and they were Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda. Here he is the lone juror in a murder trial that is unsure that the defendant is guilty. He slowly and logically begins to change the minds of the other jurors as they swelter and suffer together in the miserable Jury room. With the exception of the first few minutes of the film the entire action takes place in that confining space as the men behind the masks begin to show their true selves.

As many plays do (although this movie was originally a television production and subsequently adapted to the stage), it has a definite message and tries as hard as possible to convince the audience that the writer is correct. Unfortunately, I wasn't convinced. I maintained my belief that in the United States of America, everyone is entitled to his own opinion. Lee J. Cobb nearly echoes this sentiment verbatim in the film, with extreme passion. Henry Fonda (and writer Reginald Rose) argue that in the United States, the ""reasonable doubt"" portion of the jury system is more important than every man's right to a different opinion.",

The script is excellent with the gradual escalation of doubt adding a level of excitement to an already interesting concept. Watching the recent Egyptian film Clash the day before where a number of disparate men are trapped inside a police van for the duration makes for an interesting comparison but whilst the Lumet film appears rather theatrical by comparison a similar tactic of using close-ups helps considerably in maintaining the interest and increasing tension.

It concerns a group of twelve jurors who are retired to reach a verdict on a murder case involving an eighteen-year-old living in the slums of New York, who is accused of murdering his father at their home. We are immediately taken into the New York City courthouse, where the twelve jurors are sent to their private room to discuss the case and come to a unanimous vote in favor of life or death for the boy.

The nod goes to the performances by an amazing cast who hold it together in the confine spaces of the one setting. You would expect a film that mostly takes place in the one room to be theatrical, but Lumet manages to create the intensity with his tight direction and the brilliant use of deep focus and wide angle lenses.

258,20 October 2012,simon-harris20,8, Supposing we get it wrong ?,"The plot of this film unfolds entirely in a claustrophobic and uncomfortably hot jury room. The twelve angry men of the title are jurors and must decide the fate of a young man accused of killing his father. It does not help his case that he is poor and Hispanic, and not even the tone of voice of the Judge in the case seems to hold out any hope when giving instructions to the jury about their forthcoming deliberations. The evidence to convict, and thus send the man to the electric chair is overwhelming, and the first vote taken by the jurors is 11:1 to convict. Then Juror No 8 (Fonda) starts dissecting the evidence piece by piece in an almost forensic analysis of the facts. Is everything as it seems ? Of course not. The whole film is built around the concept of reasonable doubt and whether our individual prejudices will allow us to see it. The film offers no safe answer, as even the juror who was completely dispassionate about the whole affair turns out to be mistaken. A tour de force performance by Fonda as the Liberal everyman we all wish we could be, but with excellent performances all round, particularly from E G Marshall as the composed and evidence-led Juror No 4, and a scene stealer from Lee J Cobb as Juror No 3. This film is an object lesson in film making. The tension, which ratchets up nicely throughout the film as each successive vote is taken, is created entirely by the friction between the twelve protagonists. We are presented with a cross section of American society in the sixties, and undoubtedly we will agree with some of their perspectives and disagree with others, although in fairness to Lumet the unsympathetic characters are not difficult to spot and there are some powerful moments as their true characters are revealed. There is a valid question raised in the middle of the movie by Fonda's character: there is a man's life at stake: shouldn't they take some time to talk about it ? After all, supposing they get it wrong ? I think that whether you come away from this movie as a champion of the jury system will depend on whether you believe that your peers are indeed ""twelve good men and true"" as the one point this movie does make is that while the jury system is all we have, it is far from foolproof, an can easily be derailed by ignorance and prejudice. In this case, however it doesn't and this leads me to suggest an interesting aside. I believe that if this film was made again for a modern audience, and here I am also discounting the 1997 remake, so let's say a 2012+ audience, the director might wish to provide an ending where the Fonda character does not win through in the end, and the petty arguments and prejudices of the majority of the jury are too powerful to be overturned. However, for it's time and place, this is an almost perfect film, filled with excellent performances, and a Hollywood morality tale ending where goodness and common sense win through in the end. No wonder Fonda allows himself a Mona Lisa smile as he walks away from the Court House at the end of the movie. Brilliant.",

But I think the movie is overrated. Its plot line is very very straight so that you know the end right when you start watching. There is no real turn, that blows you away. It is quite simple.

Well, this boy is being accused of murdering his own father and is also going to be given the death sentence. Seriously, what's not to love about this film? I really loved how it doesn't show you the court case which saves time and most importantly, gives you a neutral view of the case. This also makes what the dialogue a lot more interesting. The more they discuss the case, the more you learn about it. This is even more genius because you don't even know if the evidence they are discussing is factual. I also loved how distinct all the men were. Especially for a black and white film, it could've been very difficult to tell who's who but by not giving them names and instead giving them each their own personality. The guy with the high pitched voice, the guy who gets mad all the time, it's easy to know who's talking and what their stance is on this case.

272,3 October 2011,PWNYCNY,10, The jury system is far from perfect.,"If there is any movie that more plainly dramatizes the need for a major revamping of the jury system, this movie is the one. This movie dramatizes in no uncertain terms the chaotic process associated with trying to determine guilt or innocence. Instead of being impartial, the jurors are guided by their emotions and most openly admit that they really cannot determine the truth of the case. This movie completely underscores and conforms the need for a professional jury system. The present system is so messed up that now almost both prosecutors and defense attorneys will do almost just about anything to avoid a jury trial. They are the experts and they know that once a case go to a jury, anything can happen. This movie is great because the story is completely plausible. Jurors ready to fight each other; jurors who are angry, who really have no interest in deciding the case other than just to get it over with; jurors who are projecting their own emotions onto the defendant or prosecutors. In short, this movie most effectively and succinctly highlights the glaring imperfections in the system of justice that is structured in such a way as to almost guarantee that mistakes will be made, and that is because the jurors are laymen and are being asked to apply complex legal principles to cases that often hinge on circumstantial evidence. Although the cast includes major stars like Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb, it's really an ensemble cast. Ed Begley gives a fantastic monologue, ranting and raving, a really classic performance. After watching this movie, one can better understand why cases are plea bargained. It has nothing to do with ensuring justice; it's just a way to avoid having to go to trial - by jury.",
273,11 January 2011,mjneu59,9, no argument here: it's still a classic,"An all-star jury deliberates what seems to be a clear-cut murder charge, but each guilty verdict is swayed, one by one, by the reasonable doubt of good Samaritan Henry Fonda. The film was made in defense of an insecure legal system, showing how a jury of one's (all too human) peers, sidetracked by prejudice, laziness and impatience, can still deliver an impartial decision after considering all the available evidence. The drama is played out in real time, and with real emotional power, building considerable tension out of the conflicts between each character (many of whom would likely never have been selected for an actual jury in the first place). Credit Reginald Rose for the elegant simplicity of his original screenplay, and 33-year old Sidney Lumet (making his feature film debut) for the all but invisible direction, maintaining the punch of the original story (a stage play originally written for television) without it seeming at all like a claustrophobic, one-set theater piece.",

275,27 June 2012,estebangonzalez10,10, The jury is now in session!,"¨It's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this. And wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth. I don't really know what the truth is.¨ 12 Angry Men is one of the best courtroom dramas I've seen despite the fact of it being filmed way back in 1957 in black and white and happening almost entirely (except for the opening 3 minutes and a few seconds in the end) inside an enclosed room. So why is this so good? Because Reginald Rose came up with an excellent story, which he wrote as a play first and was later turned into a movie under the direction of the great Sidney Lumet. This was actually Lumet's first feature film and among his best movies all time, although it wasn't received really well when it first came out. This film paved the way for Sidney who in the 70's made one great film after another (Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, and Network). 12 Angry Men works thanks to the strong characters that are introduced in the story starring Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb. In order for a film in an enclosed room to work you need a very engaging story with interesting characters and that is what Rose was able to do. Many great plays have failed to perform well in film, so credit has to be given to Sidney who managed to maintain the tension and suspense in the movie. As the film moves on the enclosed room seems to be closing in on each character, and this was achieved really well by Sidney. The dialogue in this film is really powerful and authentic as we see how each character interacts with one another. Sidney manages to let the action play out through words because the entire film is one giant deliberation between these 12 men.",

At first some are inclined to answer this question on the basis of racism (""We all know how these kind of people are"") or pure indifference (""I have tickets for the baseball game tonight. I would like to make it on time""). One man however reminds all the others of the principle according to which someone is innocent until proven quilty. Does this man get allies?

The way the men deliberate and challenge each other is what should happen in any jury, truly look at the facts and arrive and the best decision possible. The beauty of this film is we didn't need to see the murder or even scene to visualise the murder. It's brought to life in a small room.

For example juror #7, he never puts his views to the test, his convictions doesn't change, he doesn't even want to hear evidence that might lead him to the truth, he doesn't want to discuss major issues, nor ask questions, he doesn't care about the life of a young man, nor his death, he only wants to attend a basketball game, to come out of the room where the temperature is favorable. We also have juror #3, a good example of those people who think they are taking the right decision based on their own convictions, but they probably don't realize that their attitudes are nothing but reflection of their own experiences, background and feelings that have been buried deep inside. We also have a juror who can't judge a charge away from his class and ethnic convictions, and we have one who doesn't care to participate in the first place, because he believes they will surely come to a right decision.

Initially, 11 of the 12 find him guilty, but the one holdout(Fonda) makes his case for further deliberation, and gradually persuades the other men to his side. But the question still remains: Was the defendant innocent or guilty? Though undeniably well directed and acted, with an engrossing narrative, the one flaw is the Fonda juror, who is just insufferably sanctimonious! His argument of ""It's Possible."" to argue reasonable doubt is absurd, since if taken to its logical conclusion, would never lead to a conviction, since ""it's possible"" that it was the evil twin, or ""it's possible"" that it was paranormal in some way! It's more a study of how one strong-willed man can persuade weaker-willed men to his way of thinking, which does not inherently mean a morally just outcome!

300,17 February 2008,Howlin Wolf,10," ""12 Angry Men"" is a consistently fascinating film, but one where it's conclusions don't hold up in a lot of modern-day democracies...","I liked the observation that even juries can become suspicious of one another despite the fact that they're all working toward the same end, and since legal teams are all human they may still be subject to the same propensity to err as the rest of us. There were times however when I disagreed with the influences that brought about the verdict. One of those cornerstones is the notion of 'reasonable doubt'. Clearly this particular principal isn't applied as strenuously as the justice system says it ought to be in all cases that are heard today. My bet is that often these days verdicts are reached by the appeal of common consensus, and any apparent holes are ironed out by majority opinion instead of meriting closer inspection. As one juror says, you can use the counter-argument of ""supposing it happened this way?!"" for just about anything. If that is meant to be the clincher that makes adjudicators unsure, then almost nobody would be getting locked away even with lots of admissible evidence stacked up against them.",

It can only be considered merciful that such an attitude was not one shared by television director Sidney Lumet, who instead seized advantage of a myriad of factors which could have resulted in a catastrophic film (a solitary location, a hasty shoot, budget constraints) and somehow extracted from them an effort to which the billing of 'one of the greatest motion pictures of all time' would be a title hardly disputed by the general public.

The life of a young man likely to be innocent is an enormous responsibility for any jury in the world, and the plot goes around this issue. People in the jury do not necessarily think in the same way, some may favor what the supposed evidences showed in the process, others do not think too much and go behind the wave of the opinion of the majority, while others may be going deeper into this matter and not accepting all testimonies as good evidences. Furthermore, majority always tries to convince that minority who really analyzes each evidence and its truth. That's what we can see in ""12 Angry Men"", which was filmed in a room with the participation of only 16 actors, some of them playing outstandingly like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Jack Warden and Martin Balsam among others. It is a paradox to note that such an excellent material only got Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for best director (Sidney Lumet) and actors (Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb).

Very few of these men should have passed a jury selection process; they were impulsive, lacking in compassion, ignorant of the law, and highly prejudiced against anyone not like themselves,except for two or three. This wedge enabled Henry Fonda, the lone dissenting voice at the start, to make a series of points that eventually blew away the arguments that the young man was guilty. During the process of passing judgement, the jury is subject to an intense self-examination of their own prejudices and opinions.",

I remember them well and I know I'm not alone. Most all of them have had superb careers and were leading men. The name that transcends them all is of course Henry Fonda; the coolest and most deliberate role was his and he owned it. I think of all the others as co-stars and not supporting actors. Lest we forget the directing by a master, Sidney Lumet, and camera crew as well as the grips who had to allow the story to flow without interfering; splendid work. I don't agree with some reviewers who state this sort of drama in one room is not and could not be done anymore; it was done magnificently in the 2010 movie ""The Sunset Limited"" with Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson; however that was only two men going back and forth with their arguments, and the script was worked from a successful play. I expanded on the qualities of it, in a review; the 1957 ""12 Angry Men"" is superior in a few ways. The dialogue is more difficult and requires very good direction and oddly, the one room also for stage for 'Sunset' was bigger and allowed gesturing which '12 Angry Men' were limited in such acting resource.",

Starring Henry Fonda and some of Hollywood's finest stars at the time. screenplay by Reginald Rose who wrote probably one of the most interesting, compelling and stunning scripts ever made. one jury tries to convince his fellow jurors to reconsider the case they were given and discuss the trial and evidence. soon enough the feud and rage among the characters starts growing. the room the jurors are in slowly starts to be filled with dynamite. shot perfectly and filmed marvelously. there was one scene in particular that impressed me: the opening scene when all the jurors walk inside the room and get to know each other. the scene is shot in a form of one shot, with a few close ups during shooting. its a well establishing shot that opens the plot of the film. the dialogue is probably the best part of the movie. so many great scenes with dramatic lines and dialogue so well written, it should have won the academy award for best screenplay. overall 12 Angry Men is a absolute masterpiece and a must watch for all film buffs. people can learn a lot about dialogue and character's interactions from this film.",

This have more gravity to it and it's the main reason one juror opposes guilty at the beginning. Throughout the process they talk it out and see maybe he is guilty, maybe he isn't, but there is more reasonable doubt than there was at first glance with the trial. It's a movie all in one room and that is 62 years old so the odds were in the favor of me not enjoying it but I get why this is rated so highly and I enjoyed it.

The movie tells the interesting story of a dissenting juror in a murder trial who slowly manages to convince others that the case isn't as obviously clear as it seemed in court. In which the Juror that tries to convince the others is played by Henry Fonda who gives the best performance of his career under Lumet's masterful direction. The other jurors are played wonderfully played by Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Ed Begley Sr., Jack Klugman, and Lee J. Cobb (in his best performance since On the Waterfront.). In my cinematic opinion I consider this film as not only a great from Sidney Lumet but I also consider it as his best movie that he ever directed.

Or it may be Henry Fonda, who having seen the play on TV insisted on a feature film, raised the money and chose the cast. The claustrophobia associated with stage to screen adaptations works to this film's advantage. Spectacle is offered in the two-shot, three-shot, CUs and ECUS by topnotch DP Boris Kaufman and rival John Ford's Monument Valley westerns or Cecil B. DeMille's Biblical miracles.

And yet they did. And how. Henry Fonda plays superbly well, as all actors, in this argumentative arm-wrestle between heart and brains, the 'heart' being the humane aspect and utter respect for others, and 'brains' being the logical, cerebral but ultimately lazy approach to problems. There is a very, very strong morality in this film, and unlike what you'd think, it is very, very subtly implied, carefully placed throughout the genes of this masterpiece, and very strongly executed. This film is pure acting where film is closest to acting on a theater stage. This film is asking philosophical questions with purpose and meaning and depth rather than fancy intellectual babbling. And it is a grande analysis of the psychology of men, on many different levels and in a plurality of examples. And never in excess, or exaggeration. Not one over-dramatic scene. Just right.

346,3 August 2017,oOoBarracuda,10, 12 Angry Men,"I wonder what it must have been like for Sidney Lumet to direct a perfect film for his feature film debut. Lumet had worked on television shows before directing his 1957 film 12 Angry Men, a debut film examining justice and the motivation behind people's actions and the motivation behind their decisions when a group of jurors decides whether to convict a young man of a murder that would result in his being sentenced to death. First developed for a CBS Studio One anthology television series, Reginald Rose wrote 12 Angry Men and developed it into a teleplay in 1954. Lumet's version is still thought of by many as a perfect film 60 years after its release. With an all-star cast including Henry Fonda, Martin Balsam, Lee J. Cobb, and Jack Klugman among others, 12 Angry Men is my personal favorite film to watch when I want to see a collection of the best acting talent. What I wouldn't give to have been in the theatres during the first run of 12 Angry Men. I can only imagine the audience reaction to such a powerful yet understated film.

Cobb onto the jury.  Even if he was just the public defender, it seems to me he'd have some sense.  Also, again even though this was a different time, I read an article by Alan Dershowitz who points out there's no way Henry Fonda would have been able to bring a knife into the deliberation room.

As the story unfolds, we get to see how each juror decides guilt or innocence in a true testament to the intellectual diversity of 50s America, and indeed present day America. I can give current names to each juror from people I know personally. Made prior to Bill of Rights reforms and Miranda rights, the way people make decisions on guilt of innocence is timeless. Stereotypes, ethnic hatred, past fraternal experiences transferred onto the defendant all masterfully depict human frailties. In the end one lone voice of reason tries to Socratic-ally make the jurors look within themselves to identify the flaws in their decision making process. Innocent until proved guilty, the human condition, society in general is on trial here. This movie has a place in everyone's collection. This is real life.",

This film is a study on the nature of man and all of what he thinks. It's a study on why we take action about pretty much anything. Beneath all the convincing and lecturing, the main character shows more than that: the psychology of the masses, the prejudice and it's roots, the mixed feelings of thinking that you're doing good even when not sure if you are and so many more. I don't really want to get in to the story of the film, not only because the film offers a quick and grabbing pull into it's universe, but also for not wanting to ruin the experience of meeting the cosmos that Sidney Lumet orchestrated for the audience.

The quality acting aptly balances out the democratic message as each juror listens past their own snap judgements. A score more suitable for a sci-fi B movie can't derail the sharp 12 Angry Men drama. While many courtroom dramas are memorable, it is the back room drama that feels much more personable.

396,7 May 2012,manendra-lodhi,10, A Pure Epic!!!,There Are Some Movies which keep themselves apart from all other films. 12 Angry men is one of them. I read sometime ago about the definition of movies by alfred hitchcock as to all life drama minus the boring part. This movie clearly defines this. Filmed entirely into one room itself is an achievement for a film made so earlier. The movie helps filmmakers to think differently and not follow the established rules.

Yes, its better than Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon, just as good as Fonda's Ox-Bow Incident, and almost equals Lee J. Cobb's The Man who Loved Cat Dancing (just kidding about Cobb!!!). This is NOT a court-room drama but instead concentrates on the jury deliberation process. We have 12 angry men - all familiar faces giving ace performances - stuck in a hot courthouse room with an out of order fan on the hottest day of the year. The humidity is killing them and they have to decide whether or not a Hispanic teen from the slums is guilty of a murder. The vote has to be unanimous or its a hung jury. Juror #8, Henry Fonda, is the only member of the jury who wants to question the evidence before sending the boy to the gallows. For the rest, including the audience. its a cut-and-dry case.",

This is not the type of film I would typically expect to even be interesting. Nearly all of the film takes place inside a single room, as one lone juror (Henry Fonda) tries to convince the other eleven that the accused party is not guilty of murder. The film is composed of nothing but dialogue, but don't let that stop you from watching it. Few films can rely this much on dialogue to keep its viewers interested the entire time. Like all great courtroom dramas, ""12 Angry Men"" is an intense film, not because it is action-packed but because we must watch twelve men make up their minds and weigh all of the evidence. It is intriguing what each of these men come to realize as they ponder for hours upon end. Not a bit boring. I can watch this film multiple times and still be fascinated by it each time. The acting is some of the most superb I have ever seen, causing the audience to feel the tension going on in the room in each scene. An absolutely perfect movie.",

The back room of a courthouse where a jury of ordinary men has to decide upon life and death becomes the place of first rate drama, where a seemingly insignificant shadow of a doubt makes people talk at least once more about what at first appeared to be a clear cut case.

Some bring personal prejudices into the jury room - others couldn't care less about the outcome. These points are effectively raised in the movie.",
407,2 September 2019,RhapsodyReviews,10, Brilliant Film.,"'12 Angry Men' is a drama film directed by Sidney Lumet. The film tells the story of a jury of 12 men as they deliberate the conviction or acquittal of a defendant based on reasonable doubt, forcing the jurors to question their morals and values. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The defendant is an 18-year-old male. There are two witnesses: a lady from across the street and an old man who lives below the defendant.
This is hands down my favorite film of all time. I could watch it repeatedly and never get sick of it. It's so well crafted and damn perfect in every way. It's a classic and when they attempted to remake it in 1997 it just didn't hold up to the beauty and standard that this film laid out. It's master craft filmmaking at it's finest.
Henry Fonda is a standout in this movie, he is great! Being made in the 1950's I was very impressed with all of the acting involved with this movie, but Henry Fonda was my favorite. That is in part with the dialogue that this movie has for his character. It's so realistic and believable, and it is executed brilliantly. Every actor did a great job bringing their character to life, especially since none of them are given a name and we just know them as Jury Member 1, 2, 3 and so on.
I have nothing negative to say about this movie, which is crazy because every movie is said to have some flaws; I see none here. The acting is great, the story is entertaining and real, and the cinematography is breathtaking. The way they use long shots and move the camera steadily around the room to capture different conversation in the beginning was fantastic. Also, there is one other long take that is worth mention. It involves this older gentleman, and he is getting tired and angry that this situation is taking so long. He starts to talk about the suspects ethnicity and saying he is guilty because his kind is always guilty, and they should all be put away. He keeps talking for the course of about 3 minutes and we slowly see every other jury member stand up from the table and walk away silently and ignoring him. This scene was so powerful, one because of the dialogue, but another is because it is one long scene and you feel what the other jurors are feeling the more the man speaks, anger.
Overall, this is still my favorite movie of all time. I have never seen a movie that made me feel the way I feel every time I see it. I think this movie has something for everybody, even if you're not a fan of black and white films, I beg you to give this film a chance.",
408,9 February 2013,kurosawakira,9, Fireworks From Start to Finish,"There's some wonderful acting in Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" (1958), especially between Heston and Welles.

Probably this movie is smart enough to make up the number of characters to at least 12 men to make up for the rich details.

The bridge on the river Kwai and 12 Angry Men. Both of them has enough power to blow you out of your mind and possibly your seat, but hopefully not your window :) This production is of course not a very big one, not involving any CGI or action sequences. But, it just proved again a movie should essentially be justified by its story, not the visual effects, unless you can make all the visual effects a part of the movie, which will not be discussed here. 12 Angry Men is, to my surprise, not really a ""court"" movie, but instead, a jury room movie. 99% of the story was told in the same room, showing 12 men talking with each other in probably the real time.

And, it all takes place in ONE ROOM. What in the blazes!!! It's groundbreaking!
I also find this movie eerily reflective of current characters/personalities in today's political landscape. Those who are angry, those who think, those who don't care, those who are too hard headed to think, those who follow what everyone else does, those who think only surface level, And many more of course. This movie is really quite incredible in what it has accomplished. A lesson to take away from this to apply to today's politics would be to settle down, lay aside your pre conceived notions and listen to what others have to say. If you disagree, bring it up respectfully and be open to their responses. Use your head. As you can see from this film, and life, this is the only way to change ones mind.",

421,26 May 2019,mohit_sinsniwal,9, Excellent work by everyone,"An excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. Instead of following the trial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. The film begins with the end of the trial. The jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is taken and the result is 11:1 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror #8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. But not everyone is easy to convince.",

423,25 September 2013,jgcorrea,7, Rather Disorderly Men than Irate Men,"The inflamed comments are probably Pavlovian responses to the movie's politically correct quotient. Quality performers meet deep message. The most obvious flaw in this supposed classic, one of the most super-estimated films in history was as follows: real juries are allowed neither to carry their own experiences nor to consider evidence not presented at trial. If the jury had acted in accordance with the correct legal procedure, there would have been no basis for the plot, therefore no drama, therefore no catharsis. An intriguing theme doesn't always result in a good production. What shall I call a movie including clichéd, implausible characters, and a foreseeable twist (a 11-to-1 vote changing into 0-to-12)? Juries exist in order to allow the cold letter of the law to be broken, or temporarily suspended. That's what they're all about. That's their raison d'être. A judge can acquit a suspicious defendant for lack of evidence. A jury may convict him or her for ""feeling his or her"" guilt. The institution of the jury was thus an historical way to ""humanize"" lawsuits. If jurors were so one-dimensional, mindless and easy to persuade, courts should certainly keep them afar.",

Jurors nearly come to blows over disagreements about the case. One juror threatens to kill another in the heat of the moment.

But this one was different. It is a movie about 12 jurors who meet to decide a young man's fate. The whole movie is shot in the same building and mostly in one room.

504,22 May 2021,ihsanerhanozcan,9, Best pleasant surprise,"This is one of those films whose story started as a radio drama to make it to become a stage drama and later into films in many languages from English to German to Russian to Hindi to Kannada and the story had been featured in many TV Serials including 'Happy Days' where Fonz did his jury duty.
The movie starts with the judge instructing the 12 juries to be ushered to a room for deliberations before deciding on the guilt of a 18 year old Hispanic boy from a broken home who have allegedly stabbed his father to death.
At first look, it looks like a open and shut case to most jury members. The crime and the chronology of events is only made available to us as we listen to the discussion that goes on in the hot and stuffy room.
The 12 members are all Caucasian males of different professions. No names are made available to us, only their professions (car salesman, architect, ad man, architect, watch maker, painter, man who grew up in slum). The heat in the room also took the toll on the mood of the jury. Most of them are eager to finish off their tour of duty as soon as possible and continue the usual lives. So, when the architect (Henry Fonda) suggests that he would like to discuss the case before deciding in the fate of the young man, they naturally get annoyed. They put their decision to a vote. The initially outcome was 11 to 1 for a guilty charge. As the decision was not unanimous, they started talking. They all agreed that the defence counsel, probably working pro bono, did not put his mind and soul to defend such a case as it was not rewarding and the boy was a delinquent anyway.
They also realised that there were pitfalls in the witness' story. An eye witness alleged saw the act from a moving train and another, a hemiplegic neighbour supposed to have dashed at a quick pace to witness the event.
As the discussion goes on, they put the verdict to a vote. As time goes on more and more people started having second thoughts on passing a guilty charge.
More and more people get into each other's nerve.
The story goes on with finally with the vote goes on 11-1 in favour of a not guilty charge when somebody realised that the lady witness could be wearing glasses, hence it was not possible for her to identify the assailant as she was lying in bed and people do not generally wear glasses when they are going to sleep.
The last man standing soon realized that he was recalcitrant because of unresolved issues with his son with whom he was not in speaking terms. He finally gave a not-guilty charge making it an unanimous decision.
This film is very cerebral in nature with all scenes happening in a room with no action, swashbuckling scenes or special effects. And on top of it, there is not a single female in the cast of actors. It gives good lessons in the art of persuasion and reasoning. Jack Klugman (Quincy M.E.) and Jack Warden are the familiar faces in the movie together with Henry Fonda.
The interesting thing about this story is that they stereotype class, not ethnicity. One has to remember it was made before the era of the Black Liberty and gender equality movements. Hence, there were no African Americans and women in the panel of jury. Only a nationalised European (probably Swiss) was there.
Just a thought... I am sure that in the Bollywood version, the producers must have included some dance sequences and some masala as well! If not, it would have brought in any returns at all.",

Some of the arguments about the trial are really stretching, but in the end, the trial is not even what the film is all about. Fonda is great, as always, but the glory here goes to Lee J. Cobb.

508,9 January 2022,bypeterfenton,9, Timeless masterpiece,"The12 Angry Men is one of those movies that you just have to see. Unlike a Sayles movie, you know how 12 Angry Men will end, but there are such polar opposites on the jury that the intrigue is in what could possibly cause one of them to change his vote. It's not only that you should see it because it's good, you should see it because it teaches, reminds, and/or reinforces very important lessons on morality and how society should function. It's a timeless film.",
509,20 March 2020,t-81966-84968,8, A brief evaluation,"12 Angry Men, directed by Sidney Lumet, is a taught and tense thriller without any guns, bombs or violence. I instead, it focuses on twelve men, locked into a room to decide the fate of a man on trial for murder. It is the hottest day on record outside, and tensions mount as the agendas of each man are exposed, analyzed and ultimately dealt with in one way or another. At the beginning of the film, eleven of the twelve men vote for a guilty verdict, but one man holds out, and upholds the principles of the system he is a part of.",

511,2 August 2014,NachiBhatt,10, masterpiece! one of the best movie ever.,"12 Angry Men proves that a masterpiece is all in the details. This is, without a doubt, one of the best dramas ever created. Nice short runtime, small cast, all filmed in one room.m, it's just so tight. The beauty of it is that just from dialogue alone we are thoroughly entertained and it maintains a sense of tension throughout. The crime is never re-enacted, it's from the descriptive dialogue that we picture it in our heads. Writer Reginald Rose knew that the most powerful tool in film was words. The cast was high calibre, Henry Fonda leading the view of not guilty. It's pretty difficult to go against him when he is full of suaveness and so convincing. We get to know each juror as the film goes on and we soon start to explore the possibility that their personal lives are tainting their decision. That, was what made it so palpable. It was clouding their judgement, and their stubborn personalities made it all the more satisfying if they did change their mind. Persuasion is a powerful tool, but add a hint of conviction and you can manipulate anyone's mind. Several nice details were included, I like the fact it was set on the hottest day of the year. The heat evidently getting to the jurors, it made them more irritable and heightened the angry emotions within. Director Sidney Lumet did so much in such a little space, technically. When the jurors enter the room, its a sublime long five minute shot and he manages to share the screen time with each juror equally. He was able to convey their personalities instantaneously just by their attire, then when the discussion commences we start to dig a little deeper. The screenplay really is the winner here, if anything it makes me want to work in law. Dramas do not come better than this, 12 Angry Men easily gets the perfect rating. It sits in the inclusive list of masterpieces.",
512,10 March 2020,mitch-bulfin,10, 12 ANGRY MEN (1957) - 21/10/2019,"The highlight of the whole movie is that the shooting location is in a conference room and toilet, which can be said to be a simple and single scene. Through dialectical discussions and objective statements, some people's subjective ideas are broken. The film focuses on the dialogue and debate of the characters. The protagonist understands everyone in a dialogue with an individual through his sharp observation. He finds a breakthrough through dialogue and some of their language and expression and then slowly break their ideas one by one. The film pays attention to dialogue and expression, and it is very wonderful to reverse the things with a small probability!",
513,19 April 2020,r-89491,9, Wonderful!,"I love the films of Sydney Lumet, but this shines above all his other great films (The Network, Dog Day Afternoon, The Verdict, etc). Henry Fonda does a terrific job as the protagonist of the film. He is a level headed architect who is essentially forced to convince the other men of the defendants innocence. Through this we meet our antagonist (Lee J Cobb). A man who allowed personal bias to get into the way of a fair trial. A man that Fonda's character is able to make look foolish over and over. A character who is described as a ""Sadist"" and a ""Public Avenger"". Lee J Cobb always plays a good villain that's for sure. This maybe even better than his performance in ""On the Waterfront"". Being confined in the jurors room for all but 3 minutes gives the film a sort of claustrophobia that works perfectly. Not to mention it is the hottest day of the year and all the men are sweating. It certainly adds a bit of tension subtilly. Nothing but great things to say about this gem of a movie. Please watch if you haven't seen.",

How it become anti-thesis & arrives in the end with synthesis on a discussion table among these 12 jury is a thing to watch here.

It is not a treatise on how to discover the truth, on the contrary ... the truth often does not exist, except in those who have actually carried out certain actions, but Justice, in almost the whole world, is based precisely on trying to get as close to the truth as possible. Very often this approach is horrible, as we have seen many cases of acquittal, as there is the classic ""reasonable doubt"", and it is precisely here that the authors take us. The truth does not exist, even the Juror 8 repeatedly says so, the fate of many men and women is linked to a very thin thread, which other men and women have to decide whether to cut or not. Justice, when addressed in any film or novel, is a very hot topic (see O. J. Simpson or Robert Durst, but there will be hundreds of them we don't know), because it involves so many variables.

Yes, Fonda's character is very skilled at manipulating the facts in the jury room, which does create enough reasonable doubt in the minds of a confused jury. Fonda truly does have the ""soft sell."" Of course, Fonda's acts should have been carried out by the public defender who was representing the kid, if they had, the district attorney could have countered all of them. But the fact that the public defender did such a poor job, it ends up actually handicapping the prosecution. Everything in the jury room is left to speculation, because it could not be fully uncovered in the court room. All of the points made by Fonda could have easily been addressed and most likely shot down by the DA. If anything, they could have been explored. I think this movie speaks towards the poor defense that most poor/minorities get when their lives are turned over to public defenders that are working 10 cases at one time. This is after all a Warren Era case. In the end, we have a jury trial, in which the Prosecution presents an open and shut case. The defense is too incompetent to make one valid argument for not guilty. However, the case gets re-argued in the jury room, by twelve amateurs that don't really have all the information they need to properly asses the facts of the case. The reality is, that if the kid had had a good defense attorney, he would have been found guilty. But the bad job done by his ill-prepared attorney created the perfect conditions for one juror to raise reasonable doubt. Now, if that is not an indictment against our criminal justice system, I don't know what is.",

Packed almost entirely into one plain meeting room for deliberation, the simmering screenplay should keep anyone glued to their screen into the very last frame; tension like this is simply unavailable these days.

Don't make the mistake of confusing this with the colour remake, although good it does not match up to this original and best version. For me the best bits are the part where Jack Klugman's character produces the knife ( although this could never have happened in a real Jury it is stil dramatic ) and then there is the part where Lee J Cobb breaks down while looking at a picture of his son.

I feel sorry for those under 20, because they probably have never heard of this movie, but for those who have, it will open them up to many others. Every generation (including mine, HS class of '71)believes that their parents don't understand them. I was definitely no different.

564,10 March 2010,dimitrisalomao,10, Necessary...,"In the overheated jury room of the New York County Courthouse, a jury prepares to deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. The judge instructs them that if there is any reasonable doubt, the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the defendant will receive a death sentence. The verdict must be unanimous.
The evidence at first seems convincing. A neighbor testified to witnessing the defendant stab his father from her window. Another neighbor testified that he heard the defendant threaten to kill his father and the father's body hitting the ground, and then, through his peephole, saw the defendant run past his door. The boy has a violent past and had recently purchased a switchblade of the same type as was found at the murder scene, but claimed he lost his. The knife at the scene had been cleaned of fingerprints.
In a preliminary vote, all jurors vote guilty except Juror 8, who believes that there should be some discussion before the verdict is made. He questions the reliability of the witnesses. Producing his own switchblade, he throws doubt on the supposed uniqueness of the murder weapon. He says he cannot vote guilty because reasonable doubt exists. Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot, from which he will abstain; if all the other jurors still vote guilty, he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one not guilty vote. Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote, agreeing there should be more discussion.
Juror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the threat the second witness claimed to have overheard. Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11, who believes the defendant, had he truly killed his father, would not have returned to the crime scene several hours later to retrieve the murder weapon as it had already been cleaned of fingerprints. Juror 8 points out that people often say ""I'm going to kill you"" without literally meaning it.
Jurors 5, 6, and 8 further question the second witness's story. Juror 3 is infuriated, and after a verbal argument, tries to attack Juror 8, shouting ""I'll kill him!"". Juror 8 points out that this proves his point about the defendant's words. Jurors 2 and 6 change their votes; the jury is now evenly split.
Juror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi, based on the boy's inability to recall certain details. Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory. He is able to remember events from the previous week, with some difficulty. Jurors 2, 3, and 8 debate whether the defendant could have stabbed his much-taller father from a downward angle, eventually deciding it was physically possible, though awkward. Juror 5 points out that someone who knew how to use a switchblade would have stabbed underhand at an upwards angle.
Impatient to leave, Juror 7 changes his vote and is confronted by Juror 11; Juror 7 insists, albeit unconvincingly, that he thinks the defendant is not guilty. Jurors 1 and 12 also change their votes, leaving only three guilty votes. Juror 10 erupts in racially motivated vitriol. The rest of the jurors turn their backs to him and Juror 4 tells him to sit down and be quiet. Juror 4 declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts back to a guilty vote.
Juror 9 realizes that the witness, coming from bed, would not have had time to put on her glasses in time to see the assault occur, making her story dubious. The remaining jurors, except Juror 3, change their vote to not guilty.
Juror 3 gives an increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks about his strained relationship with his own son. In a moment of rage, Juror 3 tears up a photograph of him and his son before breaking down sobbing. He mutters not guilty, making the vote unanimous. As the others leave, Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat. The defendant is found not guilty off-screen and the jurors leave the courthouse. In a brief epilogue, Jurors 8 and 9 introduce each other for the first time by their names before parting.",

This movie is one of the few of its day that I have seen that does not suffer from these problems (the others being mainly Hitchcock films- there was never any hokeyness in those).  Instead, it is a great character study.  The dialogue is believable.  Really the only thing that makes this movie unrealistic if it were to be set in the present day is the absence of non-white jurors (of which the remake took care of) and of women (which the remake did not address).

626,14 April 2019,namannavineet,10, A look at the jury members trying to come up with a fair decision,"This is a fine film with a terrific cast. Its Spartan set serves to draw the viewer into the intensity that churns throughout the deliberations of the twelve men constitute the jury in a criminal case. It is hard to imagine a simpler story line: the twelve person jury has retired to deliberate the fate of a young man charged with murdering his father. One of the number (Henry Fonda) votes ""not guilty"" in the first vote. The other 11 jurors, more or less convinced that they are discussing an ""open and shut"" case, immediately set out to prove him wrong. Instead, one expresses doubts about the evidence and proceeds to convince the other jurors, one by one, of the flaws in the evidence and the existence of a reasonable doubt as to the guilt. Nearly all of the action takes place in the jury room, or in the restroom adjacent to it. There is no recreation of the crime other than those portions of the evidence ""acted out"" by the jurors in the course of their deliberations. This film does not emphasize the police work, or the work of the lawyers in the trial, or of investigators, or forensic evidence. Instead, the viewer is drawn into the drama of twelve jurors trying to decide what is the right thing to do in the case. Each in turn reveals a bias or flaw in his logic that has caused him to view the evidence in a particular way. In the end, each is confronted to identify his blind spot and acknowledge that it is that blind spot that caused him to think the defendant guilty rather than a careful examination of the evidence. One just wants to get to the Yankees game, one believes if an immigrant is charged with a crime he has to be guilty, and so forth. There are two dramatic moments that stand out above the rest. The first is the speech by Ed Begley in which he reveals that his determination of guilt is based on nothing other than blind prejudice. During his speech, the jurors leave the table and turn their backs on Begley, who in the end acknowledges his bias. The second is when the final holdout juror, Lee J. Cobb, comes to grips with the fact that he hopes to punish the defendant as a means of vicariously punishing his own son, who has apparently rejected Cobb. Of course each of those instances are high melodrama -- would that racial or ethnic prejudice was as easily identified and eliminated as it was in the film -- but each is played out with sufficient intensity as not to seem hokey or contrived. The film does show its age in a couple of respects -- there are no women on this jury, and no people of color -- an all white male jury in late 1950's New York is pretty unlikely. Nonetheless, this is a superb film with tremendous performances by the ensemble cast. On another level, ""Twelve Angry Men"" betrays a kind of pre-Vietnam, pre-JFK assassination innocence about the ability of American ideals to triumph over all sorts of biases if only people are made to confront those biases. That idea is of course harder to sustain post-Vietnam, post-JFK murder, post-Watergate, but it is worthy of noting that not too long ago, it was still believed that such a triumph of ideals was possible. In the polarized nation we live in now, where the more obvious people's biases become, the more tenaciously they cling to them, the underlying message of ""Twelve Angry Men"" just might be one we need to hear.",

Don't get me wrong, but in my country it is not usual to resort to this type of trials, where the decision depends largely on the lawyers' ability to convince a group of jurors. Here, the decision depends more on the judge, or on a collective of judges. Resorting to a jury trial is provided for in Portuguese law, but must meet a tight set of prerequisites, which turns out to be a very unusual option.",

The characters had real depth to them, even with little information provided we understood who everyone was, and the kind of personality they harbor. I really was kept on the edge of my seat when they're deliberating, and the ending was absolutely perfect.

Sidney Lumet was already experienced when he directed this movie but still 12 Angry Men is an amazing first film. Henry Fonda is the main dissenter from the jury who tries to convince others that the case is not as simple as it appears. Joseph Sweeney who plays the role of the old man also does a remarkable job. The movie proves that a defendant has the right to a fair trial regardless of his social or economic status. I wish this movie could be shown in every law school so that lawyers and judges can understand the gravity and importance of their decisions. The movie is more than 50 years old but still feels fresh and is also a must watch for anyone who loves good cinema and for people interested in film making. This is also a perfect example of a simple yet powerful movie that will stay in the minds of the audiences. I can bet that anyone who has seen this movie will not be able to forget it easily.,

In comparison to more modern (and histrionic) attempts to anatomise the legal process (such as the absurd Murder One), the merits of this judgment shine through: less really is more.  The ensemble cast is excellent, and all the characterisations are well-conceived and executed, with considerably more depth than is common in films from this era.

The first time I saw it was in my civics class my freshman year of high school and unlike my other classmates who saw it boring and dull I was for lack of a better word riveted and here's why: The beginning of the film brings you into the tail end of a trial about a teenage boy who's accused of murdering his father. The evidence is a switchblade knife and the testimony of a old man and woman who heard and allegedly witnessed the crime. The Judge sets the tone for the film explaining that the ""jury"" (you included) have to decide whether the boy is guilty or not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The jurors descend into the confines of the jury room and are locked in until the verdict is made. Most of the men automatically deem the defendant guilty just because they want to leave and a few because of the evidence which consisted of the eye witness testimony. When the first vote is taken Henry Fonda (juror #8) is the only one who says not guilty but not because he thinks he not guilty or guilty but because he isn't sure. The film then progresses into Fonda breaking the case down to the others and slowly but surely guiding the others into a verdict of not guilty all except juror 10 and 7. After some heated prejudicial and racial words eventually all become convinced of the kid's innocence. The very end of the film concludes that men go their separate way revealing only 2 of the men's names and the picture ends.",

Exploitation of special effects and the plethora of augments which bog Hollywood main-stream projections leaving the essence of the plot line non-existent or heavily in question is not exercised in Sidney Lumet's sublime and profound production. 12 Angry Men plays spontaneously in accordance with the nuances of a dozen jurors who have, placed before them, a case which involves powerful yet questionable evidence against a young man who presumably murders his father. Eleven of the jurors find the testimonials of the only two alleged witnesses incontrovertible while one dares to differ and hence through impartiality and a strive to revivify the loose pieces of evidence which feebly serve to incriminate the accused, bolsters the rest of the reluctant jurors to spend several hours of self-sacrificed time for arriving at the most logical conclusion. The performances in the film are starkly genuine and each actor fits his respective role like a glove. No other film of it's classical era and genre may best serve to enlighten, entertain and stupefy you than this internationally loved and strongly enduring saga of courage, recalcitrance and what it means to indulge a reasonable doubt in a situation of life and death.",

And the benchmark for such films is 12 Angry Men, a timeless classic about one man standing alone to prevent a grave injustice. A boy is accused of murdering his father. The defense attorney was utterly disinterested, so the prosecutor's case appeared clean-cut.

This is the definitive cinematic ""performance"" of Reginald Rose's play; the one or two trivial flaws are of no consequence whatever.  On the stage, they WOULD be of consequence.  As E.G. Marshall performs the role, Juror nr. 4 is so humourless and anal that you start to wonder if he's really all that bright (and the story requires that he really IS all that bright).  And Henry Fonda tends to play Juror nr. 8 from moment to moment, in effect contradicting himself (if you find yourself failing to warm to him as much as you should, this is the reason).  THE two key performances, in short, are weak.  On stage this would be fatal.  On the other hand, with STRONG performances all round, ""12 Angry Men"" on the stage could not possibly go wrong, however much the director takes it upon himself to stuff things up - just as the stage director of ""Don Giovanni"" can make a donkey of himself by setting the action in present-day Darlinghurst, if he likes, and, with sufficiently good musical performances, the opera will not be harmed.",

The actors portray the characters that they depict so wonderfully with such brilliance that one tends to get totally engrossed in the film and script. The script should be appreciated for it's simplicity- 12 Jurors and just one room. The audience gets tense and sweats in suspense as the final verdict comes closer. And also a great work of camera is done by Boris Kauffman where he makes the screen less wide as the end approaches that the viewer too gets the feel of the tension and the claustrophobia.

714,5 August 2021,Praxhant,10, Masterpiece!!,"12 jurors decide the fate of an 18 year old accused of murder who faces the chair. As the title implies there is tension and anger aplenty in the jurors room as the all-male cast goes at it including Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, Ed Begley and Jack Klugman. A great cast and great script directed by Sydney Lumet in his first film. Lumet would go on to have a string of hit films in the 60's and 70's including The Pawn Broker, Fail Safe, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon and Network but has been fairly inconsistent since. Lumet certainly knows how to get the best of his cast when he has great actors to work with and 12 Angry Men must have required some strenuous rehearsals. A remarkable screenplay from television writer Reginald Rose who had originally written this for television in 1954. Like the film Marty that had also been a 1953 teleplay that was adapted to the big screen in 1955 by it's writer Paddy Chayefsky, Rose does the film screenplay based on his television teleplay. This was only the second film that Rose wrote a screenplay for and he would only do a handful of movie screenplays in his career which was mostly television work. Polish-born cinematographer Boris Kaufman who was a veteran of Russian, French, Canadian and American films does the photography here. It was nominated for three Academy Awards including including major awards in Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay but amazingly no nominations for any of the ensemble cast. Fonda, did win a Bafta and Jussi Award for Best Actor and was nominated for a Golden Globe and Cobb also got a Golden Globe nomination as supporting actor but the large cast must have canceled each other out when it came to nominations for the Oscars and all the other various industry awards. Passionate, gripping, intense, compelling drama. It's obviously dated with it's all-white, all-male jury and may be a little too heavily centered on the jury room with not much room for anything else but it's great character development and holds up well.

721,21 February 1999,TheAgent,9," No fancy sets, no special effects, just great acting","12 Angry Men is a 1957 courtroom drama film telling the story of 12 jurors deliberating over the guilt of the 18-year-old defendant, based on the context of reasonable doubt. The film itself serves as an excellent testament to the power of negotiation, exploring a plethora of techniques in building consensus and how they can be used to overcome the difficulties that arise in this process of discussion. The setting is the perfect stage for negotiation, as by virtue of them being in a jury, none of them know each other and none of them have personal stakes in the discussion, making the ensuing discussion a battle of logic, wit and delivery. The film intentionally sets itself up in a manner to elicit introspective thought from its audience by not revealing the names of any of the characters until the exchange of dialogue at the end of the film, pushing the audience towards self-evaluation with regard to the traits displayed on screen.
The premise of the film places the fate of the defendant in the hands of the jury, a death sentence hanging over his head. The jury has been instructed to deliver a unanimous verdict, denying them the luxury of agreeing to disagree. While initially there is a near complete vote in favour of the defendant's guilt, by the end there is a consensus of the inverse, following discussions that span the length of the film. This begins with Juror 8 being the only one arguing for the defendant's innocence, setting in motion events that lead to a unanimous vote to acquit the defendant. Juror 8 is framed as our protagonist, with Juror 3 as our antagonist, and the major learning points lie in the differences between the two.
At face value, one might imagine that Juror 3 is the superior negotiator between the two. He's confident of his points, quick to refute counter-arguments and does not back down even in the face of a strong point made against him. This is in stark contrast to the far meeker Juror 8, who appears to not only seldom refute the points of the other jurors, but even comes across uncertain of his own position. His foil, Juror 3, utilizes what Fisher and Ury define in their book ""Getting to Yes"" as Hard Positional Bargaining. His ultimate goal at the end of the discussion is victory, his is distrustful of others and treats them as adversaries and is both rooted in his position and demanding in this battle of wills. With this frame set up, it would be easy to determine that Juror 8 uses the opposite approach with his gentler personality, a Soft Positional Bargaining, seeking agreement, trusting others and treating the other negotiator as friends. But this is not quite what he is actually doing, and therein lies the first hidden strength of Juror 8. What he does over the course of the film falls is change the rules of the negotiation. From the beginning, he avoids coming across as confrontational by conceding that he might not be sure if the boy is truly guilty or not. In a regular setting this might seem like argumentative suicide, but in the jury setting, this is an excellent framing tool. All jurors have the civic responsibility to ensure to the best of their ability that the verdict carried out is just. When the negotiations began, all of them were defensive against the disagreement and prepared to refute him, but in expressing that ""I don't know whether I believe it or not, maybe I don't."", he changes the game such that it invites further deliberation from all parties, rather than drawing battle lines between two opposing positions. This is made possible as it is necessary to convince others that your mind can change in order to change their minds. By pushing away from the idea of bargaining for positions, he not only drives the other jurors to be more open to discussion, but also to make a wiser, less hasty decision over the life of another.
Juror 8 is also careful in his discussions not to yield to pressure. It would have been easy at the start for someone to give in to peer pressure simply due to an overwhelming majority against him, but he chooses not to. Holding fast to his interests, or in this case the interest of fairness and justice, was the first step in swaying the minds of the other Jurors. He utilizes the pressure to his advantage as ""Under the pressure of a forthcoming negotiation, your critical sense is likely to be sharper."" (Fisher & Ury, 32) and ensures that his points are all rooted in logic. This is unlike figures such as Juror 7, who succumbed both to personal interest and pressure of time when he switched his stance due to his urgency to attend the baseball game. Any insistence he puts forward in this setting was unconvincing and he additional managed to earn the disdain of the other Jurors for his lack of dedication to the topic. Juror 7 reveals in his actions a lack of objectivity which costs him his credibility, a trait which we will later see repeated with Juror 3. On the inverse, Juror 8 constantly takes action to make sure that not only he, but every other Juror is as objective as possible, reminding them that their role in the Jury might cause an innocent boy his life. Once again he changes the rules of the game, bringing them not to some other form of discussion, but rather realigning a discussion that initiated on a note influenced by personal factors with its intended execution. Doing so reinforces his credibility, as the other jurors see his points not as baseless argument, but spoken and driven by his responsibility to fulfilling his civic role to its upmost. This then pushes them to approach the discussion with the same attitude, one that in driven by justice and resolution rather than positions and confrontation.
By the end of the negotiations, Juror 3 reveals a fatal flaw in his argument, and that is his skewed vision towards the subject matter of the discussion. As he began to lose ground, his arguments became increasingly desperate and unconvincing. He ultimately reveals that his desperation to see the defendant be found guilty is driven by his strained relationship with his son, something that had been alluded to throughout the film. This reflects that his arguments while largely logical, were not driven by objective criteria. This introduction of personal stakes is an immediately penalizable point in the jury setting, and suggests that from the start he had already made up his mind without likely having truly considered all the facts. He was obsessed with what James Sebenius describes as ""believing your own line"", or rather, placing all his focus upon defending his position that he would disregard otherwise convincing points and arguments. His arguments thus took a form more akin to stating what he would and would not accept. Such an approach is costly in an argument as it inclines you against even the most logical statements. Refusal to acknowledge a reasonable argument makes an individual come across as unreasonable and Juror 3 is guilty of that time and time again.
The success of Juror 8 in convincing the others of his beliefs was fundamentally to acknowledge that he could not change their minds at all. Rather, the only person who can change a person's mind is themselves and he reframed the rules of the game to facilitate that. He had the upmost of respect for the views of the other Jurors, readily conceding when to them good points of arguments they had made, seeing them as part of the thought process. He displayed great awareness that simply because you disagree with a conclusion does not necessarily mean that you disagree with every thought that brought them there. While Juror 3 actively tried to pull the others to his side, Juror 8 pushed the others to re-evaluate the facts and then pick a side of their own. This is in no way implying that he does not make arguments to support his case, but rather he presents it as perspective and evidence to be considered as opposed to an undeniable truth. Even without a direct, relentless adversary like Juror 3, Juror 8 would have quite possibly brought the others to the same conclusion and in this context Juror 3 lost the war of attrition to Juror 8 by his own hand, gradually destroying his own credibility and ultimately dissuading the others of his cause.
These points, among many others, are among the reasons why 12 Angry Men is regarded as one of the most acclaimed courtroom dramas of all time, being seen by even the Library of Congress as worth of the National Film Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".

Only rarely people distinguish between film set and real life, and he Mr. Polanski is one of them at least I presume.",
750,7 February 2015,petarmatic,8, Oh man! The court cases!,"Yep this movie is so great. The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.",
751,23 May 2020,drogueriadelavilla,10, Magnificent Movie,This film is without any flaws. It's the closest to absolute cinematic perfection I've ever been privileged enough to see. I'm a 13 year old kid and last year when I was in 7th grade civics class my teacher brought this in when we were talking about court cases. I was excited because I'm a big Henry Fonda fan! When I first watched it I loved it but it wasn't my favorite film. Then after I watched it 4 more times I gradually loved it more and more! It then became my favorite film. So this is the plot. 12 jurors are deciding the guilt or innocence of an 18 year old boy accused of stabbing his father with a knife. On the surface the kid looks guilty but juror #8 (Fonda) wants to discuss all witnesses accounts given in court. Eventually he decides that the kid is innocent and eventually so does everyone else. It's interesting to listen to even the smallest details become the most important facts of the whole case. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. Every frame of the film is golden. Whoever did the casting is smarter than a scientist. It's so good it looks like I've completely run out of complements to say about it. Watch this movie. It's so amazing it makes everything else seem low. If you ever come across a chance to watch this movie by all means take it!,
752,6 October 2013,ofpsmith,10, My all time favorite movie.,This movie really is great! It is very gripping. Going into it I thought that I may be slow and boring but was pulled in immediately. The cast is great from all perspectives. And the work behind the camera is just as good! All in all 9.2.,
753,8 May 2021,vinnie-79062,10, Almost perfect,"I rarely give a film a '10.'  But, this film with absolutely no weak spots deserved it.  Everything works.  All of the actors are great.  The film has a darkness to it, a quiet gray sense of hopelessness, as boring as a New York summer day, hot, humid and dark.  The weariness fades as the various members of the jury reveal bits and pieces of themselves as the plot unfolds and the wave of change sparked by new awareness begins to sweep the dreary juryroom.  The jurymen begin to lose their apathy, antipathy and conflicted, convoluted attitudes.  As the action goes on, each man must confront himself, his own values and his own fears, prejudices and weaknesses.  The ending is a triumph for all of us.  Reginald Rose not only put together a flawless thriller but look at that cast.  Not a cull in the bunch.  Several went on to establish themselves as character actors, e.g., John Fiedler, Robert Webber, Edward Binns, George Voscovec and Joseph Sweeney.  Some others were already stars in their own right, Ed Begly Jr., Lee J. Cobb, Henry Fonda and others, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, E.G. Marshall and Martin Balsam went on to achieve stardom in films and TV.  All were veteran character actors who add a ring of credulity to their roles.  Rarely, indeed, only in a great once in a while, does it all come together as is does in this film.",
754,14 October 2001,artzau,10, EXCELLENT...no other word for it,"This film essentially begins with a jury being sequestered in a room in order to render a verdict on an 18-year-old defendant charged with premeditated murder. To that effect, since a guilty verdict would result in the death penalty, a unanimous decision is required. That being said, it stands to reason that each of the jurors would want to make sure that their verdict was the right one. However, because the evidence strongly suggests his guilt, some jurors become highly indignant when one particular person known only as ""Juror #8"" (Henry Fonda) expresses doubts--and it's then that some people show their true colors. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this is probably one of the best legal-dramas that has ever been produced due in large part to the gripping plot and the number of outstanding actors also cast with Lee J. Cobb (as ""Juror #3) and E. G. Marshall (""Juror #4"") standing out the most, in my opinion.

Basically, the entire film seems to be borrowed material.  In the second half of Ikiru, a group of individuals argue back and forth about the intentions of a character who passes away.  In 12 Angry Men, the jury argues about the guilt in a case. It's not the same situation, but it's basically the same type of storytelling.  The problem is that the second half of Ikiru is so much better than 12 Angry Men, I was kind of left wondering what is so great about 12 Angry Men in the first place.  I'd recommend seeing 12 Angry Men first if you haven't seen Ikiru, because it simply can't compare to Kurosawa's masterpiece.  Good, but it is unquestionably outclassed by Ikiru.",

794,12 August 2019,rahmanism,10, A wonderful classic movie.,"I have tried, and tried again to like this film. But I fail after the first fifteen minutes. For a start it is a Henry Fonda vehicle based on a television play. And sadly it still looks like and feels like a television play. The line up of actors like Ed Begley, Lee J. Cobb etc is impressive and they act well if over theatrically. Fonda is Fonda and I repeat he is the star and he does his best to shrug off his usual coldness on film. I have nothing against his acting except that I do not respond to his way of performing. A little more warmth, and being less dour I would perhaps, and it is a big perhaps, to respond to him better. So this for me is one of the fault lines in the film and his stabbing a knife on the table is a great moment. Being a big star the moment has tremendous impact, and no doubt most audiences are caught. As for the plot of the film it is about a youth who has to all intents committed a murder and twelve jurors debate about his going to the electric chair or not. I know it was 1957 and just maybe it was too daring to ask but no one questions capital punishment in itself, and twelve angry men could dispute that in itself but of course it is not on the table. The film is often praised for its camera movements, claustrophobic towards the end and less so at the beginning. The only unintended humour for me was one of the more elderly men taking too long in the toilet. Or bathroom in ' respectable ' terms and the latter is of course used. No spoilers to the ending. But with signposts all the way a child could work it out. I also have not read in any reviews of this ' great ' film that the jurors are all baying for blood, and to get out of the room on a hot day as soon as possible. My opinion is I know a minority one, but for me the film does not dare to even question the biggest of all basic and human issues and that is if capital punishment is right or wrong in itself.",

It's one of few films which helped shape who I am as a person. When watching it I constantly visualise the details in my head of the events and locations of the murder case being described. At the beginning of the film, all the jurors bar one believe the boy in question is guilty of murdering his father. By the end of the film, they all change their vote to not guilty. How is this possible? Why just the most incredible 90-minute exhibition of human psychology and argumentation. I enjoy never knowing what really happened; did the kid commit murder or not? - It's up for the viewer to decide. 12 Angry Men is a movie that is hard to write a review for; I wouldn't be surprised if I come back to add more since I find myself watching 12 Angry Men at least once a year. With layer upon layer upon layer, this is a movie I could talk about hours, and always finding new aspects to discuss on each viewing.

806,29 December 2000,smakawhat,10, Solid. Period!,"Sidney Lumet's directorial debut remains a tense, atmospheric (though slightly manipulative and stagy) courtroom thriller, in which the viewer never sees a trial and the only action is verbal. As he does in his later corruption commentaries such as Serpico or Q & A, Lumet focuses on the lonely one-man battles of a protagonist whose ethics alienate him from the rest of jaded society. As the film opens, the seemingly open-and-shut trial of a young Puerto Rican accused of murdering his father with a knife has just concluded and the 12-man jury retires to their microscopic, sweltering quarters to decide the verdict. When the votes are counted, 11 men rule guilty, while one--played by Henry Fonda, again typecast as another liberal, truth-seeking hero--doubts the obvious. Stressing the idea of ""reasonable doubt,"" Fonda slowly chips away at the jury, who represent a microcosm of white, male society--exposing the prejudices and preconceptions that directly influence the other jurors' snap judgments. The tight script by Reginald Rose (based on his own tele play) presents each juror vividly using detailed soliloquies, all which are expertly performed by the film's flawless cast. Still, it's Lumet's claustrophobic direction--all sweaty close-ups and cramped compositions within a one-room setting--that really transforms this contrived story into an explosive and compelling nail-biter.",

It deserves the eighteenth rank it got in IMDb's best movies list. To summarize the plot: it is about twelve jurors on a murder trial. Eleven out of twelve think the defendant is guilty of murdering his father and one of them thinks, ""Element of Doubt"" still remains. The movie is about the character study of all the twelve people in that room trying to sift through all the evidence. The twelve men jury represent a cornucopia of Americans: the bigots, the prejudiced, the cool and calculated, the timid and the self-aggrandizing gloaters. It shows how some people get carried away by some outward appearances. At the end of the movie, we do not know if the defendant is actually guilty or not. We just know that there exists an element of doubt in the evidence provided. It shows how a careful evaluation reveals there could be something beyond what is obvious. As an academic researcher, I have been taught that most of the times, the most obvious solution could be wrong and this movie bears testimony to this fact. I think every jury member should be recommended this movie before he/she decides on the verdict.",

Lumet, who is of course one of our brilliant filmmakers, is great in that he never let's the drama (which often is very intense) or the acting go overboard. Furthermore, the film is very unpretentious. This frank approach to the material is exactly what makes it so believable.

824,2 December 2008,john-zeigler,10, 12 Angry Men Great Drama,"Why make another version of this movie? I just finished watching the 1957 version and I admit it seems like a play (and probably was developed originally as a play since it basically takes place in one room) and it was also broadcast live during the heyday of the golden years of television. We'll never see the talent of the actors in the room who have since passed-away. In fact, only Jack Klugman (at age 85) is still with us. Other movies seem tailor-made for plays, such as Glengarry Glen Ross. I'm not sure if the casting was simply dead-on or the actors happened to nail the roles they had or a combination, but each person seems very well-suited to his role and it's hard not to get wrapped up in the dialogue and the general pace of the movie (as though you were peering into the jury room through a peephole). In fact, as I watched each actor, I identified with people I knew who had the same characteristics, such as Jack Warden's wise-ass, or Ed Begley, Sr.'s angry racist or Lee J. Cobb's uptight, high-strung yelling man or any of the other people. I do think that Jack Klugman's role may have been miscast. I didn't necessarily identify with him as a product of the slums. They could have cast a minority for his role but I guess in 1957 all-white, male juries were what was the norm.",

To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human. It's the true whodunnit without Hercule Poirot. This is the element that is most obvious; that 12 men can sit in a single room for the entire movie and interact and still keep us totally occupied. Enough has been said about this. I just wish that contemporary film making could take a bit more from these masterpieces; let the fine actors that we have do their individual things.",

Lee.J.Cobb plays the most complex of the Juries, and his slow descent into his true feelings toward the case are both compelling and believable. There are some Juries that don't really get that do not get that much screen time, but the film makes sure to make them have a key role somewhere. Some may dislike that there is only one location, but I think this allows the film to stay focused and not stray onto another side story, in this way it is very similar to rear window, in that you never see anything that happens from anyone Else's perspective apart from James Stewart perspective.

Therefore, the movie plays heavily in sentiment and the ideal that no innocent man will ever be electrocuted to death. Which brings into debate an argument to abolish capital punishment. In the end, I think this kid could have done with 15 years to think about it, as although the ideal was upheld, in the end I think the defendant was a slippery fish that got away and a GUILTY one at that.

867,27 February 2022,aironneil,9," About as old as my dad, but still very good and mostly relivent.","12 Angry Men manages, despite being low budget and, as of today's standards, old, to captivate and hold attention for its entire run. The film, mostly carried by brilliant acting and intensely realistic screenwriting, portrays the immense pressure, complication, and difficulty a jury faces even for cases that might openly seem easily soluble.
The film manages, especially in its earlier acts, to uphold the moral dilemma entirely from the point of view of the jury. We are never shown whether the boy is guilty or not - and thus are left with the same perspective as the jury has. It is, despite the jury's final verdict, still quite possible that the boy in question did, in fact, murder his father. However, 12 Angry Men slowly and gradually allows the viewer to gain the understanding of the approach taken to cases such as these.
While pretty much the entire film stays consistently excellent, the ending, and the conclusion overall, isn't as airtight as the rest of the film is. Despite this, 12 Angry Men is still quite a stunning masterpiece, and has hardly gotten worse over the years.",

875,3 January 2021,mis-pretty,9, I love this movie,12 Angry Men is about a jury arguing over the innocence/guilt of a young man who did/didn't murder his father.  ,
876,3 August 1999,Arkaan,10," Great, A Classic every sense of the word","This film is shot entirely in a small room ( with the exception of approx. 3 mins, in the beginning and end) and is the perfect example of characterization. One of the three best films of 1957 ( the other two being Paths of Glory and Bridge on the River Kwai) this is a brilliant movie.  One of the few films where one set is an asset, this shows both sides of a coin when juries deliberate. The acting, especially by Henry Fonda, is stunning.  IF there was an Oscar for best ensemble cast, this movie would have won it. Why it wasn't on the AFi 100 is beyond me ( and I agree with most of the choices). In the end, what makes this film so great is its humanity, and it shows us that we all need humanity.",
877,23 May 1999,Arkaan,10, Brilliant and intense,"I came to know about this movie from the top rated movies list of IMDb, I was intrigued by the title at first and surely wanted to give it a try. It'd turn out to be my first Black and White movie and it didn't disappoint at all. Absolutely amazing plot and you're hooked from the start about how things will unfold. Well delivered and interesting turn of events. Should surely give it a try.",
878,11 March 2021,iamsagarcastic,9, Great concept and a must watch.,"The concept behind this film is so simple and yet it is brilliant. Set almost entirely in one New York jury room on the hottest day of the year as twelve jury members discuss the case of an 18 year old man accused of murdering his father. A guilty verdict would mean the death penalty. On the face of it, the case seems simple and eleven of the jurors vote ""guilty"" but one man (Henry Fonda) dissents and tries to talk his fellow jurors around. The events of the film take place in real time and as the film progresses more and more of the characters of the individual jurors and their individual prejudices are revealed.",
879,31 January 2005,RobertF87,10, Best Courtroom Drama Ever Made,"The fact that this movie is basically set in one room is testament to the great actors in the movie. The story, the dialogue, and even representing both the tension of the room and also the climate (when it eventually rains is prefect). Acting, script, and tension is brilliant. Must see.",
880,23 October 2021,robd-50235,10, Great actors commanding a room,"12 Angry Men was the highest ranked films in the imdb ""Top 250 Movies of All-Time"" that I had never heard from. That was my main reason for renting it.",
881,27 December 2002,Herr-Waldo,9," First listen, then watch","The acting alone gives this movie a spot in one of the best pictures in film history. My personal favorite part of the movie was how the characters reacted to things and how they spoke, in particular one scene at the end that I really felt, but I want this review to be spoiler free so I will not go into any more detail than that. The director put these actors in that room for hours and it shows. Great movie you should definitely watch it.",
882,15 January 2022,Malcolm-Maclaren-2022,9, Incredible,"12 Angry Men is a film that wasn't hailed as revolutionary at the time. In fact, it didn't make AFI's first ""100 films"" list and was only ranked #87 after the revision. It wasn't even a box office success when it was released. Despite all that, its with good reason that this film is ranked so highly on IMDb's top 250 list.",
883,22 March 2012,narnia4,10, Who would have thought 12 men sitting at a table could be so exciting?,"I haven't seen too many classics in my time and I am particularly fond of this one. When it comes to the justice system and political jousting, this is probably the best movie ever made. Jury deliberations are always held out of public view and it was interesting to see how they could possibly go. Granted that this movie is a work of fiction, I found it to be one of the most realistic films of all time as well.  This is a dramatic legal classic and I can see where Scott Turow and John Grisham got some inspiration for their respective career choices maybe.",
884,31 July 2003,K-Slicer,10, Always watch the classics!,I agreed with the vast majority of the remarks made in the critiques of this great movie - I think you are on safe ground when you call this film a 'classic'.,
885,30 August 2009,Brooksider100,9, Ed Begley,"12 Angry Men is a good example of ""Less being better"". ""SPOILERS AHEAD! I have seen this movie a million times and every time I see it I notice something that I never noticed before.  I just saw it again on SHO direct and for the first time I noticed a woman on the screen.  She is walking very slowly in front of the court house in the last shot.  Even though the movie was essentially shot in one room, I wasn't wanting for other scenery. Something that happens to me while I look at one room movies.  The movie is about 12 jurors who decide the fate of a 18 year old kid who is accused of knifing his father to death.  Listening to the jurors you get the idea that this kid has had a lot of problems in his life and he is either a Puerto Rican or some other type of latino and poor.  I say PR because this is NYC in the 50's.  And some jurors refer to him as ""those people"".  We get to see people who seem like normal folks coming out about their hatred about poor ethnic people. We have a man who for some reason is using the defendant for his own agenda.  We find out later it has something to do with his son.  We have a juror who is so worried about a baseball game he is willing to go along with other jurors so he can go to the game.  There is a ad exec who is a idiot and a stockbroker that is uptight.  I think this really is accurate about what type of people get on a jury.  What I also thought was interesting is how the witnesses stories was refuted.  I don't think the witness's meant any malice but they wanted attention or to be important and they taylored their story for that affect. It also touched upon how bad a poor persons lawyer could be.  If it was not for Henry Fonda and the John Sweeney character  that kid would of been toast.  The jurors also wanted to throw in the towel very quickly.  The scary part is this.  I have heard that many times there is a lone juror who wants to talk it out but because this person is alone they get intimidated by the other jurors and they back down. In this movie these jurors even accuse the Jack Klugman character of changing his vote because he is said to be like ""those people"".  This happens in real life especially if the defendant is a minority and there is only one of that minority on the jury. If a Asian is a defendant and there is one Asian on the jury they are made to feel they better go with the other jurors even though they might feel the other way.  Mr Lumet was not just making this stuff up.  The remake was OK but why did they have to remake it? In the remake they changed the racial makeup but there were no women on the jury!!  HUH!  This is one of my favorite movies of all time.",
886,19 April 2004,marbleann,10, Great Movie!!!,"Can a film about 12 men sitting in a jury room deliberating the fate of one young man accused of murder be as exciting as any action film you've ever seen?  Maybe!  This movie takes place almost entirely in one room, but there is more going on in that room than you'd ever believe.  This film fascinated me from beginning to end.  I've seen it three times recently and it seemed just as fresh and gripping the third time as it did the first. What makes this movie so great?  First of all, the script and the characters are intricate and well developed. Second of all, the acting from the ensemble cast is uniformly riveting.  Third, the camera work in this film is the best you'll ever see anywhere.  Fourth, the movie has something to say about about prejudice and justice without being preachy.  It simply is on a search for truth. For my money, this is one of the finest dramas ever made.  Henry Fonda is right on target as the architect who has reasonable doubts.  Each of the other 11 actors give stellar performances of unique men who open up like books as the story proceeds. You'll be thinking about this movie long after the jury has reached a verdict.  This movie is as relevant today as it was 45 years ago.  Don't miss it.  I give it a 94/100!",
887,15 February 2003,marxsarx,9, As fresh and gripping the third time as it was the first!,"A movie with 1 hour and a half showing 12 men arguing inside a room is what one would expect to be a big failure. This one is not. It may be the best movie I've seen in my life. The actors work beautifully and the dialogs are placed in a both intriguing and, sometimes, funny way. ",
888,26 May 2012,leonardoleme9,10, just brilliant!,"12 angry men is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the most important American films ever. Ed Bagley is perfect as a rather ruthless, and somewhat, bigoted jorur. Henry Fonda give a rather fine performance as a cool under fire juror who is one the only ones to actual have an idea of what a juror should do. The way he baits at times the other juror members is amazing. Jack Klugman, in a small role, actually shows a true dramatic talent, serving him as one of the most versatile actors ever. This role, despite how small it is, Klugman gives a better performance then his more celebrated role on TV's The odd couple. My personal favorites of the movie are E.G. Marshall and Joseph Sweeney. Sweeney, in his last movie, leaves on a high note a wise old man. E.G. Marshall has a slight arrogance about him, and seems like he'd be the last person that Fonda would get to swing his way. Marshall almost upstages everyone else, despite like Klugman, playing a small role. Without a doubt, this movie is a must have for anyone collects.",
889,24 June 2005,metalrox_2000,10, A must see for everyone,"In a movie that has basically 3 settings and only 14 cast members, it probably cost more to buy the cast than it did to buy the props. It still was one of the greatest movies ever made.",
890,2 May 2005,KHayes666,10, A true classic,"This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. I saw it for the first time in a business class and that day I made my a trip that I have never forgotten. It is the type of films that you begin thinking that you are going to be bored, and after some minutes, your curiosity begins to grow until the moment when you fall in love with it. It is a trip of understanding, of doubting about everything and a lesson about the truth that usually is not something that can be seen at a first look. A wonderful script, perfect performances and a great direction. The unique thing that somebody that likes cinema can say about this film is that it is a masterpiece that need to be seen more than one time to really see all the nuances and to really appreciate it as it deserves. It is in the Top 10, but maybe it should have a better position. ",

892,13 September 2021,bahreininejad-35011,10, A perfect movie,"This is one of my all time favourite films. Claustrophobic, you can almost smell the sweat. I don't know whether it's me, but I see echoes of America today. All the characters are indentifiable, the irrational and the rational elements of society both there and possibly in the UK as well. Take a look to see an acting masterclass from all involved. A definate must see.",
893,10 November 2020,iancampbell72,10, Must see,First off I want to say I liked the movie. It had great performances all around and a compelling story. And I'm a fan of Henry Fonda and Jack Klugman. My problem is I'm puzzled that this film has such a high ranking on IMDb ? I can think of at least 10 better films (in my opinion) that are ranked far below this one. ,
894,8 April 2013,randawg72,7, Slightly over-rated.,"This is a movie I always recommend and but find it difficult to explain why, because the main plot seems very basic at first and there is not much to say about it, but once you are watching it, it traps you, every character is interesting on their own way. Masterfully written, it is more exciting than many other big blockbusters.",
895,1 August 2020,rubenmv,10," My favorite recommendation, never fails","This is probably one of the greatest and most important movies ever made. While I still love The Dark Knight to bits, I believe 12 Angry Men should be above that on the IMDb top 250.",

897,31 May 2002,kyle_c,9," An excellent ""jury room drama"" - ****","ANNOUNCED SINGLE MECHANICAL FILMS WILL NOT BE EXTREMELY EXCEEDED # 12 Angry Man is one of the best films of the cinema. The film, based on prejudice and dogmatism, has a wonderful atmosphere that does not squeeze even when it is a single moment on the go. It is a film that 12 players have played well and showed the difference with the screenplay of director Sidney Lumet. Filmin iDB score is 8.9. The movie starts in a courtroom. A murder was committed in the slum, and the son who was killed as a murderer was arrested. Whether it is a bad relationship with his father or living in a slum, and the witnesses' wording, he attracts all the arrows to the child. The court sends 12 ""ELECTIVE"" men to a room for decision. These 12 people have to decide by name. In addition, every game must be either completely guilty or innocent. If he is guilty, he will be executed, otherwise he will be acquitted. Voting is done, 11 people are guilty, one man is innocent. This is none other than Davis. Davis represents an intellectual in the film. He saw the dogmatism and prejudice in the middle and voted like that.",

Movie questioned almost every concept: What is truth, what is justice, what is guilty, what is crime or most importantly what is doubt?
There were almost only 12 characters and only one place in the movie. But with every character I was able to find something about people I know on them. That is the power of an amazing movie. I will never forget this remarkable movie.",

The first courtroom movie that I remember was the classic '12 Angry Men' Made in 1957, the same year as the first series of Perry Mason, the film tells the story of a jury that has to consider the innocence or guilt of an 18-year-old boy accused of killing his father.
