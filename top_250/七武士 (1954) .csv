0,8 January 2003,OttoVonB,10, Solid Gold,"I discovered 16 of Kurosawa's best known films before returning to the one which is commonly thought of as his masterpiece. Seven Samurai is unlike any other grand classic ever produced. It's basic plot can be summed up in a single easy sentence, yet its refinement and execution rival any movie you've ever seen. ",/
1,7 December 2003,Quinoa1984,10, Kurosawa's triumphant epic- totally & successfully driven by character and story,"Akira Kurosawa was and is considered the master of east-western film-making (in that he made his Japanese films accessible for fans of American westerns while still making the movies his country found popular), and out of the few Kurosawa movies I've had the pleasure of viewing (Hidden Fortress, Rashomon, and this) I'd have to say that while Rashomon is still my favorite, I nevertheless had a blast during this one. The story has become quite influential to filmmakers from the likes of John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven) to John Lasseter (A Bug's Life): a small village has been terrorized by bandits for far too long, amid times of civil war in the nation, and so on the advice of Grand-Dad, they decide to hire four - which soon becomes seven - samurai for the job. There's no money, just food and honor, even though the village isn't exactly pleased to have samurai back in their village. Each character is drawn and executed compellingly, though for my money Toshiro Mifune proves why he became one of Japan's most notorious film actors. His work as the brave, bold outcast of the seven is awe-inspiring practically all the way through, like the hero of a western that anyone can root for since he's a true rebel at heart within a group of men with a task at hand.

2,25 May 2010,Davor_Blazevic_1959,10," Arguably, the best samurai film ever made","Though its biblical connotation is not the happiest one (""Seven Deadly Sins"") number seven, omnipresent in our (7 days a) weekly cycles, seems to have been a lucky number in the world of cinema. Several very solid and some great movies have this number in their title, starting with gag-wise incredibly inventive Seven Chances (1925) from genius of silent era Buster Keaton, Frank Borzage's silent version of classic melodrama 7th Heaven (1927), Walt Disney's first feature-length animated movie, Snowhite and Seven Dwarfs (1940), recognized as an instant classic and remained so ever after, Stanley Donen's ear-pleasing, eye-riveting musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), staged in western milieu, with the breathtaking barn-raising dance sequence, Ingmar Bergman's literally Death-defying, answers-to-reasons-for-human-misfortune-seeking masterpiece, Det sjunde inseglet (""The Seventh Seal"") (1957), Billy Wilder's Seven Year Itch (1957), a clever and amusing first collaboration with incomparable Marilyn Monroe (a worm-up for their second, bigger if not decisive step in taboos-of-the-motion-picture-production-code-breaking, brilliant comedy Some Like It Hot (1959)), up to newer examples like David Fincher's disturbing drama Se7en (1995), one of the finest Hollywood movies of the 90's, as well as Tsui Hark's Chat Gim (""Seven Swords"") (2005), a stunner in the department of action sequences from the often under-appreciated genre Wuxia, originating from Chinese literature.",e
3,26 December 1998,PureCinema,10, Kurosawa is the greatest director that ever lived,"Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece... The Japanese equivalent to Orson Welles' Citizen Kane.. I say it's just as good, if not even better. Not only Kurosawa's most well known film, but the most widely recognized Japanese film ever made. This movie will forever be known as a milestone in motion picture history.",v
4,29 July 2001,salfamily,10, Required Viewing,"The archetypal action film, Seven Samurai is also one of the richest works to ever be committed to celluloid. Each of its characters is extraordinarily realized; each has his or her own arc, his or her own vital part to play in the film's slow progression towards its dramatic finale. Typically, Kurosawa has put the film together using an exceeding degree of artistry; each and every shot, each action sequence, is exquisitely composed; and yet none seems contrived or out-of-place within the overall fabric of the work. Everything is beautifully conceived and in focus, both literally and figuratively.",i

6,31 January 2003,simon_booth,10, Haven't you seen it yet?,"Well, if you haven't seen Seven Samurai then you're not really  qualified to call yourself a film fan, basically. One of the most  influential movies of all time, that still holds up extremely well  nearly 50 years later.  Akira Kurosawa's epic tale of heroism and barbarism set the standard in  so many ways it's hard to imagine that any modern film does not show  its influence in some way or other. A great script, great characters,  mostly great acting, splendid cinematography and action sequences that  wrote the book about how these things should be filmed. Even now, after  so many have tried to imitate or beat it, Seven Samurai remains a  totally gripping 3.5 hour experience.  Akira Kurosawa is one of the gods of Cinema - men who seem to have been  born to make films, who have it in their blood. People like Alfred  Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, King Hu and Steven Spielberg, who make it  look easy... who so obviously ""get it"". In this pantheon, Kurosawa is  perhaps the daddy of them all, however, and Seven Samurai is one of his  finest moments.  The scale of the production is remarkable - to undertake making such an  epic in post-war Japan was a feat in itself. The cast of dozens of  inhabitants of a village specially built for the movie, the 40 bandits  and their horses, all the costumes, the armour, the weapons. Few  directors could have brought all of this together and still paid such  attention to the smallest of details in script and scene. Credit must  go to the team Kurosawa worked with too, I presume   The movie's setup became the template for many movies to follow, the  most recentl example that comes to mind being the excellent Korean  period movie MUSA (The Warrior), for example. A motley band of  characters is assembled and placed in a situation where the odds are  seemingly stacked against them, and each gets there chance to really  shine, prove themselves and become something more than a normal man.  Kurosawa's Samurai movies all share a little bit in common, which is  the depiction of the Samurai as some noble beast, different from the  common and pathetic rabble of ordinary man. In Seven Samurai the  farmers are a base lot, cowardly, selfish, vain, pathetic and  treacherous. How he found actors with such miserable looking faces is a  mystery in itself. In contrast, the Samurai embody all the qualities  that humanity would generally like to believe define it (us). Brave,  righteous, honest, strong and heroic. Toshiro Mifune's character stands  in the middle and represents this difference - perhaps meant to suggest  that mankind can strive to rise above his flaws, but mostly suggesting  to me that the common man is basically a mess and we should learn to  respect our betters. Kurosawa was definitely not a socialist, unless  I'm mis-reading him wildly.  I'm sure many out there wonder, does a 50 year old black and white  movie about Samurai really have any interest or relevance to us in the  21st century? The answer is a definite ""Yes!"". Seven Samurai shows us  what cinema can be, what cinema is *meant* to be. It is moving picture  as art in a way that the multiplex-fillers of today cannot possibly  claim to be. It's a film that satisfies on many different levels, and  still provides a bench mark which today's film makers could and should  use to evaluate their own contributions. True, few out there will ever  be able to claim they've made a film that rivals Seven Samurai in scope  or beauty, but this *is* what every director should aspire to! The sad  thing is, I just can't see a project like this ever coming out of the  Hollywood studio system, where art is just another commodity and  marketing is the new god",w

8,3 February 2001,SonOfaGunderson,10, Awesome,"In 1954, Kurosawa made foreign film history with Seven Samurai. Everything about this film is just absolutely terrific. The film lasts around 3 1/2 hours, and every minute of it is unbelievable filmmaking. Kurosawa's blend of stellar craft, captivating cinematography, ravishing art direction, and unforgettable characters makes this one of the most intelligent films ever made. The first hour is devoted to devoloping the many four-dimensional characters which inhabit the film throughout. When watching the film, the audiece cares for, trusts, mourns and ultimately believes every single attribute the characters have. Samurai set up the way that many action films are made today; films like Predator and Alien still work within it's boundaries. The battle scenes are terrific and the fast-paced editing is ground-breaking. If people have a problem with subtitles and long movies, then see this and your opinions will change. The sheer filmmaking of Kurosawa will not disappoint. Also see Yojimbo and High & Low.",r
9,18 October 2005,groatski,7, Long and sometimes hard to follow.,"Okay, call me an ignorant, uncultured, short-attention-span Yank if you wish, but I found this movie drawn-out and difficult to follow. It was indeed masterful storytelling with great character development, but the movie seemed to take quite a long time to get going, and when it did it was not the cinematic juggernaut I was expecting. Perhaps my expectations were too high? I don't think so. As of this writing Seven Samurai is at #6 in the all-time greatest movies list (and the only foreign-born film in the top 20), so I've obviously missed something big.",w
10,2 August 2009,claudio_carvalho,10, One of the Best Movies of Cinema History,"In the Sixteenth Century, in Japan, a poor village is frequently looted by armed bandits losing their crop of rice. Their patriarch Grandpa advises the villagers to hire a Ronin to defend their village. Four farmers head to town to seek out their possible protectors, but they just can offer three meals of rice per day and lodging for the samurai. They succeed in hiring the warming-hearted veteran Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) that advises that they need six other samurai to protect their lands. Kambei recruits the necessary five samurai and the brave jester Kikuchiyo (Toshirô Mifune) and move to the village. After a feared reception, Kambei plots a defense strategy and the samurai start training the farmers how to defend their lands and families for the battle that approaches. ",4
11,23 October 2000,cindel-2,10," A really great epic film, beautifully told with stunning acting","This is one of those great epic films that stands the test of time. I only saw this film for the first time in 2000, almost 50 years after it was made, and was astounded by it. It was an epic that truly told the whole story. Whereas most movies today manage to skirt around huge chunks of what would happen, this movie manages to show them all, and not in a boring way. The samurai don't even reach the village in danger until more than 30 minutes into the film, all that time being spent getting to know each of the characters and the motivation and history behind them. We get to truly learn what it takes to be a samurai, and what truly sets them apart. By the time we arrive at the village we have become attached to some of the samurai in a very personal way, respecting each of them in their own way. The rest of the movie progresses as if it were a documentary, not a fictional film, where we see each and every piece of the grand puzzle that happens in this village. I can't recommend this film enough, though I must throw a disclaimer out that if you're not a fan of epic movies with subtitles you may not be as interested. It is a 3 1/2 hour long movie! But if you can find the time to sit down and watch it, I doubt you'll be very disappointed.",4
12,31 August 2001,driffma,10, Brilliant composition plus brilliant acting = brilliant flawless movie!,"It is hard to know exactly where to begin when talking about a film of such utter quality.  What must be said at the start is that ""The Seven Samurai"" is flawless.  It's characters are brought to life by some of the finest and most committed acting I have ever seen. It is a compelling story of courage, duty, honor, respect and change.",2
13,9 June 2012,TheLittleSongbird,10, Kurasawa's best film,"As much as I do love Ran, The Hidden Fortress and Throne of Blood, it was Seven Samurai that I love most of Akira Kurasawa's films. As with all Kurasawa's films, it is incredibly well made with authentic scenery that would give meaning to the term epic and the camera work is truly spectacular. This is especially true in the final battle, with inspired use of moving and multiple camera, precise editing, telephoto lenses and variegated film speeds. As always with Kurasawa, the direction is consistently brilliant. Add to that a stirring score from Fumio Hayasaka and a thoughtful script and you have more reasons why Seven Samurai is so good. The story unfolds slowly, but never felt dull to me and is never hampered by the three-and-a-half-hour running time. Plus Seven Samurai is interesting for being one of the first few to utilise the plot element of recruiting/gathering of heroes into a team to achieve a goal, seen especially with when the audience is first introduced Kambei. The action is spectacular and looks even better with the use of multiple cameras from various angles, and any humanity Seven Samurai has, and it does have a lot, is shown in a poignant way. The cast are excellent, with Takashi Shimura and especially Toshiro Mifune the standouts. Overall, of a resume of one of the greatest directors who ever lived, responsible for many wonderful movies(and I'd say that Seven Samurai and Ran are among the best movies ever made) Seven Samurai stands tall. One of the easiest 10/10s I've ever given. Bethany Cox",9

It SOUNDS like a snoozer. But just sit down to watch this film, and you'll realize how wrong you are. ""Seven Samurai"" is one of the most exciting, suspenseful films I've ever seen, and the running time passed so quickly that I wasn't even ready for the film to be over.

Shichinin no samurai is a classic example of a profound character study well complemented by some ingenious direction and breathtaking cinematography.

20,2 September 2009,Hitchcoc,10, It Helped Define Film,"This is a movie that makes over three hours seem like a few minutes. As with a great work of art, it appreciates on multiple viewings. This is a classic tale of an oppressed village under siege from enemies. They are plundered and attacked by murderous thieves and have little hope. Enter the good guys who aren't always seen as good guys. Yes, it is a classic plot, but there the comparison ends. The way Kurosawa frames his scenes, the action sequences, the close ups, the emotions expressed are seldom matched. This has everything: a massive spectacle with battle scenes unmatched, incredible acting by Kurosawa's stable, including his star Taoshiro Mifune. In the ""High Noon"" tradition, it has the theme that we need to help ourselves and not depend on others to help us. The Samurai, who have ruled for a long time, have fallen into disfavor and so there's a tension: Why should they fight if the villagers are only interested in keeping what is there's, even if it means constant raids and attacks. There are greater reviewers who have done justice to this film. I can only say that I am a huge fan.",e

The first time around I must have been distracted to the point of being inattentive and today I'm glad I gave it another shot. What particularly struck me this time was the gorgeous cinematography, which hooks you right from the start with the menacing ride of the bandit clan upon the seemingly deserted village.

The storyline was solid, but, like most movies of it's era, the over-acting bordered on being comical. Which brings up a point...I have read several user comments about how older movies don't get a fair shake in the movie rankings. I completely disagree, I think a lot of the ""timeless classics"" are rated a lot higher than deserved. Fact of the matter is, modern movies ARE better than movies of bygone eras...the acting is better, the storylines are crisper, they're better directed, there's more attention to detail, etc. This is just one guy's opinion, but after watching this movie, ask yourself a question...If this movie were to come out today (with the same acting and directing), would it receive the same high acclaim it enjoys?

30,25 June 2021,alexsnower,10, One of the best you will ever see,This movie is perfect down to every tiny detail. The plot perfectly unfolds around a town of people harassed and forced to the brink of starvation by ruthless thieves. They venture off and find a samurai who recruit a friend and 5 other men to help him. One of the men joins without permission at first but is eventually accepted. His name is Kikuchyo. This slightly comedic role played by Toshiro Mifune who transcends the character as one of the most hilarious and sympathetic I have ever seen. He is a class clown but also wants to prove he is a hero. I won't spoil anymore about him but his heroics go above and beyond what you expect of him. The other youngling Katsushiro is essentially the lead samauri's apprentice. He also has romantic interest in a local young woman. This love story doesn't make the movie of course but it's a good side story in between battles. The battle scenes (particularly the final scene) are directed to perfection looking so real you can't believe it. This movie is one of the few 3 hour movies that you can watch over and over without being bored.,
31,13 December 2016,Leofwine_draca,8," A strong, expertly-made, and influential movie","This Japanese samurai film from Akira Kurosawa sets up a classic action template that would inspire everything from THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN to THE SEVEN MAGNIFICENT GLADIATORS and utilises the style of camera-work and direction that would inspire Hollywood movies till this day.

The ""Seven Samurai"" I also rate a 7/10 because while it is a very well filmed story I did feel the length and at times my attention waned, especially during some scenes which felt repetitive. But it was a well developed and acted story, though I probably don't get all the Japanese mannerisms. And it was well filmed in black and white with good frame composition. I was also surprised by just how much the ""Magnificent Seven"" was based on this film.

Kurosawa's film's hit you on a level you wouldn't expect and they take you for a ride that is unforgettable. This film has great atmosphere and you get to see the absolutely astounding Toshiro Mifune, simply the greatest Japanese actor of all time.

It's rich with themes, defined characters, and meaningful action. First, the plot is a quintessential tale of heroes uniting for an honorable cause. Marvel constantly mimics this trope, but the imitators are countless. Meanwhile, characters are developed beyond warriors in battle. Viewers learn their mindsets and motivations. Each unique samurai adds to the story. Thus, Seven Samurai is ripe with ideas like unity, morality, humility, accountability, and identity. However, despite the film's intellectual density, its relatability keeps it entertaining.",

This is superbly crafted storytelling with great characterisation, intellect and humanity from legendary director Akira Kurosawa. Takashi Shimura exudes gravitas, wisdom and authority as the leader of the assembled collection of Seven Samurai who band together to protect a village of farmers from marauding bandits. Toshira Mifune looms large too as the mercurial and mischievous Kikuchio who adds much of the fun and excitement to the piece and Seiji Miyaguchi is perfect as the supreme warrior Kyuzo.

However, this is a great movie, filled with fascinating shots, great characters, message and dialogue. Some great quotes are thrown around in here, like ""This is the nature of war. By protecting others, you save yourselves."" And I think this is the main theme of the film. What's in it for these warriors to protect the farmers? Not glory, money or women. Only rice is offered to them and a roof above their head. It's a noble cause to help these poor people and Kurosawa makes a brilliant statement in his way of letting the viewer know the suffering and the desperation of these people. All of the samurai have interesting personalities and of course, the standout being Kikuchiyo, the loud-mouth, eccentric, often show-off character, who is only trying to win the approval of the samurai. And he is a hero and a great character. It is a great film, indeed.",
48,12 November 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,9," An amazing piece of film, but the length alone will discourage many possible viewers","I haven't seen any of Akira Kurosawa's other films, but I hear that this is his best, so maybe that's a good place to start(and maybe not). From the very first frame I was captivated by this film, and very interested in it. Then after about five minutes of watching, I realized how slow it was moving; ""Fine,"" I thought, ""it'll probably pick up later on"". But it didn't. The film stays in the same uncompromisingly slow pace for the entire runtime which is about three hours(more or less, depending on which cut/version you see). That's OK, don't get me wrong, but it brings the movie down. The film is epic, and truly astounding. It's a shame that it's so long and slow. The plot is great. The acting is very good, and great in some cases(for the most part, actually). The film contains a multitude of interesting, well-developed characters... but maybe that's part of the problem; there are too many of them. By the end of the film, I found myself being able to keep up with who was who, and as the credits came on, I couldn't really remember any of the names(though that may have something to do with them being in Japanese). The film has plenty of good dialog, though several of the characters spout lines that sound like they come from fortune cookies, but given just a little thought, they are quite profound. The film is called the first actual action film, due to the use of many plot points that have later ended up being clichés. The film has so much going for it, but at the end, I found myself barely paying attention. Maybe the film is too long for its own good... maybe I have a too short attention spam to fully enjoy the film(which is said to be a masterpiece, which I definitely won't argue with)... I don't know. In the end, after carefully going over all of the pros and cons of the film, I find myself rating it a nearly perfect 9/10. Too many low points to it to merit a perfect 10, but far too many high points to rate it any lower, even if I didn't particularly care for the last part of the movie(which probably has more to do with my attention spam than the content of that part of the movie). The cinematography is excellent. The film is very, very well-done overall, but seems a little too long and slow, and is hurt(in any other part of the world) by the very obvious Japanese culture/nature of the film, which is a little hard to accept, especially for us Westerners. It is a great film, though, and I can't argue with its placement on the top 250 best films of all time here on IMDb(it's #5 as I'm writing this). As a final note; to anyone out there who want to see the movie but are worried about violent content: everything is only implied. Much like Hitchcock, Kurosawa obviously realized the effect of only implying violence, and as a result, most people can watch the film. Most people will probably enjoy (at least) parts of it, but I fear few will watch the whole thing through. Since I barely did so myself, I can't really say anything to keep you watching all the way through to the end; but I will say that the film is visually impressive, contains some great acting, some humane and credible characters that the audience will be able to sympathize and identify with. I recommend the film to just about anyone who is interested in watching it. However, if there are action/Samurai fans out there, craving for fight scenes and Katana action, I will say this; Look elsewhere. This has very little of such, and what there is, is only implied. Watch this movie, but watch it for the drama, not the hope of fight scenes. 9/10",
49,8 April 2000,zetes,9," Great Film, but I think Kurosawa did better","Watching this film for over 3 hours, I felt excited every step of the way. I thought the situation was interesting, the characters were interesting, the acting was spectacular, and the action to be very intelligently crafted. But I felt there were some small problems, as well. The characters' names were rarely spoken, so it became easier to mix some of the characters up as the film progressed. Especially, I thought two of the samurai looked very like each other (and the person with whom I was watching this film had the same problem, so it's not just me).",

54,9 September 2006,dee.reid,10," Before ""The Magnificent Seven""...","...There was ""Seven Samurai"" (1954), famed director Akira Kurosawa's towering martial arts action epic of mythical proportions. Action-packed with a wry sense of humor, the plot concerns seven ronin (master-less samurai) who are assembled by the distraught, desperate villagers of a small farm community to fend off the bandits that have been terrorizing them. ""Seven Samurai"" is the second film of Kurosawa's I've seen within the last year, the first being ""Yojimbo"" (1961), which also featured a strong, centralized performance from acclaimed actor Toshiro Mifune. ""Seven Samurai"" is seen as the movie that helped shape Western action films, even though Kurosawa himself was said to be heavily influenced by American westerns. ""Seven Samurai"" was eventually remade into ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960), itself a popular movie in the United States but lacked the flair of its inspired source material. The actors, including lead Takashi Shimura as Kambei, are flawless, as well as the many supporting players who were the farmers. My personal favorite is Mifune's Kikuchiyo, who absolutely steals the show as a humorous, loathsome troublemaker with a dirty mouth, but earns his heroism in an honest, self-sacrificing fashion. The bandits themselves remain mostly faceless, ghostly figures on horseback, though it's easy to compare them somewhat to the portrayal of Native-Americans in American westerns. Although it's over three hours long, the centerpiece of ""Seven Samurai"" is its climatic siege, which eats up nearly the remaining hour. It's agonizing, grueling combat where many die and you are left questioning the title. But, instead of giving us one long, drawn-out sequence, Kurosawa made the genius choice and has the battle broken up into several skirmishes, with moments of contemplation and anguish between. ""Seven Samurai"" is a beautifully realized epic of mythic stature, one of the great pieces from one of the greatest directors to ever pick up a camera.",

Like so many masters, Kurosawa registers as one you have to feel slavish about and if you haven't seen enough of them in a barrage to almost become a filmmaker yourself, chances are there's plenty of this classic kicking around to catch up with if you've got plenty of time on your hands (as we find ourself these days!). Compelling, with both a gritty and epic feel as well as a grasp of class details of everyday life in this far-away time, this movie is wiling to follow every digression as though it was equally important -- as any military tactician can tell you, the key to success in everything from walking the perimeter to not forgetting intangibles and being willing to harbor any potential outcome as a possibilities. Frankly, this movie is as good for the kids as for the adults, because they're learning a lot of crap these days, and this picture puts you in a place where a lot of human life spills over -- including those in the film who do or don't value it, and what that means.

Anchored by a simple narrative of a troop of samurai banding together to protect and train a village of farmers from bandit raids, Kurosawa's film extrapolates beyond the mere telling of a story to the foundation of a legend - it is easy to imagine a comparison between a community of audiences seated and enraptured throughout the better part of an afternoon or evening and an indigenous tribe, seated around a fire and passing down their foundational stories and history to a new generation.

Each character lives and breathes beside us, to the ill fated weak samurai to the bandit who mistakenly calls Toshiru Mifune his brother. But the four chief farmers share center stage with the seven samurai, along with a few female characters, Grandad, and the bandit chieftan. One of the farmers, Ricici, is so brave that he could be called the eighth samurai. And each of the four makes a notable sacrifice to hold onto their crops. One loses his daughter's honor, one loses his home, one loses his wife, and one loses his life.

The movie tells the story of a village under attack by merciless bandits, in despair they hire seven samurais to protect them - its a classic plot, but never before 1954 had any Western movie appeared with an ensemble of heroes, and at well three hours' runtime it has time to tell rich characterizations. The film speaks to the defeated people of 1954, who regarded the Americans as much as the villagers regards both the bandits and the super-powered samurais.

Shimada (Takashi Shimura) is an experienced samurai who is approached by a group of peasant farmers and asked to protect them from bandits who continue to attack and steal their food. Shimada is honorable and sees their need and he also needs to know where his next meal will come from so he agrees. He knows he can't go up against the bandits alone so he recruits five real samurai to help him. Crazy Kikuchiyo (Toshirô Mifune) insists on tagging along even though he doesn't seem to be a real samurai. Shimada and his group of warriors train the villagers in the art of self defense and they are housed and fed. The film ends with an astounding battle when the village is attacked by the horde of bandits. The Seven Samurai is a long movie with subtitles and needs to be seen multiple times to get the most out of it. It's not an easy movie but it's an unforgettably moving experience.

90,13 October 2020,monsterhunt-94296,9, Everything you want from a movie,"Alright so today I watched Seven Samurai, probably Kurosawa's most well-known film, and for good reason. If you're thinking about watching this movie, it can be daunting for modern audiences. First off, it's 3 hours and 27 minutes long, secondly it's black and white, and thirdly it has subtitles. This film was not disappointing. It was actually very entertaining, and although there were point where you did feel the run time, for the majority of the film I was thoroughly entertained. There's comedy, there's drama, there's action, this movie has everything you look for in a film. The framing is incredible, the way Kurosawa constantly has something new entering the frame or something exiting the frame is great, the depth showing the size of this world is great, and overall the cinematography just immerses you in the film. All of the characters are done so well, every conversation has so much entertainment value, the characters just bounce off each other so nicely. The acting here is also amazing, I don't think there was a point in the film where I remembered that these are just actors. The story here is honestly pretty simple, but it has a lot of impactful moments and leaves you really satisfied by the end.
Let me talk about the action in this movie for a second, because despite the fact this is a 1954 film, it has some of the best and most intense action I've ever seen. This is due to the fact there's not just explosions everywhere like a modern film would throw at you, but the action dives deep into the strategy behind the battle as each and every enemy killed has huge significance. One thing that I really liked about this movie was how much time was dedicated to character moments and set-up. A modern studio would shred the run time by an hour and shove in more action scenes. This movie doesn't have that much action for the first 2 hours, but all of it is important and all of it is entertaining. The score here is also really good, and I thought it added some nice personality to the film. I honestly just had a really great time watching this movie. I can't think of anything else to say at the moment, so I'll leave it at that. 9/10.",
91,3 May 2005,malkane316,10, Quick Reviews!!,"Kurosawa's most famous film, and arguably the most famous film ever to come out of Japan over 50 years after its release. Endlessly influential, often touted as the first action movie, and full of rich cinematography, brilliantly constructed set-pieces, humour, sorrow, and some timeless characters portrayed by excellent performances. The Seven Samurai is still seen today by fans and critics alike as one of the best films ever made, almost flawless in every department and still as appealing and relevant as it was 5 decades ago.",

I'm relieved to realize that Seven Samurai indeed deserves the praise it gets. Ironically, it's not the best movie of the year, not even the best Japanese film of that year which was Honda Ishiro's groundbreaking Godzilla which shows how great movies were back in those days. Still, Seven Samurai is a timeless classic whose plot, duels and characters have been copied in numerous films such as The Magnificent Seven.",

In desperate, they resort to hiring samurais to fight against them. At first, it seems hopeless since all they can offer to samurais is food, not money or position. Fortunately, they happen to meet Kambei, an experienced samurai, who sympathizes with them and agrees to help them.",
95,19 March 2013,ThatAnimeSnob,7, Defending rice with their lives,"Akira Kurosawa's epic tale of the Seven Samurai is great on many aspects. At first it appears to be only about a bunch of unemployed mercenaries doing their job by defending a village from bandits. It quickly turns to a rather complicating interaction of ideals, social norms, and internal conflicts. Although the bad guys (the bandits) remain generic enemies all the way, the samurais and the villagers are shown to be a lot more than the simple stereotype they begin as. There are lots of minor side stories that flesh them out and enrich the setting with a lot of gray overtones. ",
96,19 January 2010,Ziya90,6, Kurosawa extends the story excessively and the movie itself is so pale,"My favorite Kurosawa film is Throne of Blood, Hidden Fortress follows it and the third is Ran or Ikiru. As for Seven Samurai, In IMDb, the ratings higher than 8.5 are almost equal to 10 which means a masterpiece. I don't complain about the duration of the movies and if I feel sleepy or get bored (even if I get bored very rarely), I give up watching and watch the rest of the film the next day! However, the problem here is a bit different. The film was unnecessarily long for such a story. That causes it to lose its effect minute by minute. A group of farmers in a village decide to hire a few retired samurai to get rid of the racketeers. It would be great, if such a simple story had been told in 100 minutes. Unfortunately, Seven Samurai is one of the longest movies of all time! I mean the DVD version, I guess that the number of the people who got a chance to see the international version is not many. I forgot the main story totally after a while, loosed my attention. the story was scattered. Secondly, Seven Samurai is not artistic like other Kurosawa movies, it is the most pale, the most plain Kurosawa film ever. The content is so pale also, the story telling is pale. You watch, watch, watch and watch... By the way, some people say that Seven Samurai is an action film. There is only one action sequence in the whole film which takes place near the end!!! and it was pretty short. Therefore mind!, don't expect an action movie or a real samurai movie. This is a drama about Japanese farmers and a group of Samurai. In Ikiru, the last part had seemed me excessive or unnecessary either and made me think that sometimes, Kurosawa extends the story unnecessarily, but then I realized that the part was the heart of the film (İkiru) so I changed my mind. However, I would not say the same thing for Seven Samurai. It was too excessive like its rating.",

With nothing to offer but rice and a place to sleep they needed to find samurais that were willing to fight for the sake of fighting or fight for the honorable cause of helping the little guy.,
99,20 June 2013,Uriah43,8, One of the Best Films Ever Made in Japan,"At about the same time as the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in France (1572) a civil war has broken out in Japan which has spread chaos throughout that country. Because of the turbulence, brigands roam the land raping and pillaging along the way. Having already lost their summer crop of rice to them, a small village has learned that the same band of brigands are planning to return once their winter barley has ripened. Without this crop of barley to sustain them the people in the village will starve to death. Realizing that they are no match against this group of bandits the people go to the village patriarch and ask him what they should to do. He tells them to hire some samurai to protect the village. Unfortunately, they have very little to offer other than a small amount of food. So the village patriarch tells them to find some ""hungry samurai"". With that advice a few of the farmers venture out of their village hoping to find a few samurai who might be willing to help them out. As luck would have it they manage to find one particularly wise samurai named ""Kambei Shimada"" (Takashi Shimura) who not only agrees to help them but he also recruits 5 more samurai of exceptional talent to join their cause. Additionally, another warrior named ""Kikuchiyo"" (Toshiro Mifune) follows them even though he was initially rejected by Kambei. As a result there are now seven samurai who agree to fight for the village--against 40 brigands. Anyway, rather than spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is perhaps one of the best films ever made in Japan. Be advised though that it is a bit long (141 minutes) and the acting is more than a little overly dramatic in the typical Japanese fashion. But there is plenty of action and humor along with a depth that is seldom seen in motion pictures. Not only was it nominated for 2 Academy Awards but it was also remade 6 years later into a western movie known as ""The Magnificent Seven"". Highly recommended to those who enjoy classic films from around the world.",

101,5 August 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, Magnificent.,"Akira Kurosawa's samurai classic isn't so much slow as it is meticulous, taking all the time it needs to establish - and then elaborate upon - its core conceit, characters and style. 'Seven Samurai (1954)' may be three-and-a-half hours long (and literally the longest film I've seen to date), but it moves at a lick. Of course, it's not edge-of-your-seat exciting right the way through, but it's not supposed to be. It moves towards a well-documented 'finale' that, essentially, takes up around half of its run-time. The actual gathering of the eponymous seven is a relatively breezy affair; much more time is spent on the planning and execution of the war-like village-defence that most pictures would relegate to their final set-pieces. Here, however, the prolonged battle is just that: prolonged. It's violent, messy and drawn-out, lacking any real semblance of heroism or clear cut 'good guys'. Obviously, we want our focal characters to succeed. Nobody is perfect, however. The seemingly innocent farmers have dark secrets they go to great lengths to conceal and the samurai themselves use a number of seemingly underhanded, if necessary, techniques in their quest for victory. Even the largely villainous bandits are presented as just order-following counterpoints to the samurai, echoes of the soldiers our heroes once were. They're, ostensibly, separated from the seven only by their position in the attack-defence equation. Such is the very nature of the feature, its narrative shaded in as much grey as the celluloid itself. In that, it finds a very unique, somewhat downbeat perspective. When all is said and done, was it worth it? It's a question that the piece doesn't so much seek to answer as dare to pose, rounding off a nuanced experience that isn't afraid to leave its audience unfulfilled. It spends as much time on its smaller, more personal moments as it does on its larger, more technically-impressive ones. The latter may be what everyone, collectively, remembers but the former are what make this a landmark in the genre. Each core player has something significant to do, even if they don't necessarily undergo an overall arc. Some of the main seven do begin to bleed into one another, but even the most generic of the lot have something that allows them to stand out. Plus, the focus is placed on a few key components and these are explored incredibly well. By crafting characters that seem so complete you could almost swear they were real, the movie creates a tremendous connection with the audience. You care about pretty much everyone on-screen, which leads to a great deal of tension when their lives are on the line. The unceremonious nature of every single death lends itself to an almost greater sense of loss, too; anyone could die at any moment. The affair isn't overly dark, though. It has an excellent handle on its tone, providing moments of real levity to balance out its sombre segments. When the action comes, it's as entertaining as you'd expect. It's actually tinged with a certain sadness - which makes it all the more distinct and, even, compelling - but the fantastic choreography is a sight to behold. This all results in an adventure unlike almost any other. It's a masterclass of film-making that should keep you engaged for its entire, mammoth-sized duration. 8/10",
102,10 September 2015,StevePulaski,10," A sprawling, immense epic that still feels distinctly modern after more than fifty years","Countless reviews, analyses, essays, thinkpieces, and even full-length novels concerning the sheer genius and magnitude of Akira Kurosawa's masterful Seven Samurai have been published, so a very lengthy analysis from me is unnecessary, given there's probably very little to say that hasn't already been said (the inherent struggle of reviewing beloved classics). However, in the midst of this, the obvious elements of the film ostensibly get lost in the shuffle, due to the focus being placed on analyzing themes and character motivations in the film (a somewhat essential, but sometimes distracting element to film criticism, leaving important focal points like shooting techniques, cinematography, and pacing in the dust). I'm prepared to extract Seven Samurai's more surface attributes, in addition to affirming why this film has etched itself into being one of the greatest films ever made.",

It is considered by many critics and cinephiles to be the best samurai movie ever (I put it in my top 3). Everything in this story flows perfectly, starting with the meeting of the seven warriors, their personal conflicts, their ambitions and motives and the way they face battles. It is a film full of symbology (example number 7), with an unpredictable and chaotic narrative, which leaves us glued to the screen during the 3h:30m (yes, it is a very well spent afternoon). Visually it is a milestone in the history of cinema, using techniques and movements characteristic of Kurosawa that until today few can match.

106,16 April 2020,jamesrupert2014,9, Outstanding and influential samurai sword-opera,"Desperate farmers hire a team of seven swordsmen to defend their poor village from marauding bandits. Akira Kurosawa's first, and arguably best, action-jidaigeki is the archetypal 'team of heroes' film and has been revisited in the old west, in ancient Rome, in outer-space, and elsewhere in unofficial remakes of variable qualities. The cast is great, especially Takashi Shimura as the experienced but down-on-his-luck team leader Kambei Shimada, and although some people may get a bit tired of his antics, Japanese super-star Toshiro Mifune (Kikuchiyo) adds some levity to the lengthy drama. Apparently given the OK to portray the character however he wanted, Mifune plays the samurai-wannabe is an endlessly posturing, scratching, joking, lovable-goof, a counterpoint the other six generally stern heroes (especially the po-faced master-swordsman Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi)). Legend has it that Yul Brynner, the head gunfighter in John Sturges' famous Western remake 'The Magnificent Seven' (1961) complained about co-star Steve McQueen, who he accused of 'scene-stealing' by constantly moving around in such a way as the catch the audiences' eye. If true, McQueen certainly could have taken some tips in attracting attention from Mifune's kinetic faux-Ronin. Another story about the Western version was that when asked for permission to shoot parts of the film south of the border, Mexican authorities agreed on the condition that the 'peon' villagers looked 'clean' - perhaps one of the decision-makers had seen Kurosawa's original: most of the Japanese peasants are filthy and some are down-right decrepit looking. There is not much to add to the abundance of material written about this film, its genre, director, and stars - suffice to say that it is entertaining, very well made, and the 200+ minutes pass by surprisingly quickly.",

115,1 July 2008,ebiros2,9, Akira Kurosawa's Masterpiece,"This movie is made on a different vein even for Akira Kurosawa. Kurosawa made movie to explore his inner artistry, and each movie was a different exploration of his approach to movie making. Shichinin No Samurai was different even for Kurosawa as he explored the limits of realism in movie at the time, and has not been surpassed since then by any Japanese movies. In this movie Kurosawa limited other experimentation to maximize realism, and also didn't include the twist in plot he preferred like in Rashomon or dive too deeply into personal issues like in Norainu. This is probably the reason why movie stands so well after half a century, and have such universal appeal. For instance, Kanbei's character is very believable even today as opposed to character of Chris in the Magnificent Seven which was based on this movie. It was different even for Kurosawa, and maybe the only actor who didn't understand it was Toshiro Mifune who've starred in Kurosawa's movies many times. He acts just as he does in other of Kurosawa's movies which he's played and distracts slightly from the realism. The tone of the movie is very realistic and focus on survival, as opposed to having a real war lord or a samurai. ",

Kurosawa considered ""Rashomon,"" the film rightfully credited with making the West aware of the Japanese cinema, with being neither. But in his attempt to make a truly ""realistic"" film, Kurosawa redefined the conflict at the heart of Japanese films. Before ""Seven Samurai"" this conflict was that of love versus duty, where the central character is compelled by fate to sacrifice what he loves in the name of duty. In ""Seven Samurai"" the focus remains on duty, yet the conflict is now between the real and the pretended. Calling yourself a samurai does not make you one, something proved time and time again in the film, from the test of skill turned deadly between Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi) and the tall samurai to the first appearance of Kikuchiyo (Toshirô Mifune), with his stolen pedigree.

The cinematography, I felt, was average, especially for an ""action"" movie - this is what separates Citizen Kane by leaps and bounds from Seven Samurai (also check out the first 3.5 minute, no-cut shot in Touch of Evil).

Everything about this film from the story to the acting to the characters to the cinematography is crafted to almost perfection. During the Japanese Sengoku period of civil war and anarchy a poor village under constant threat from bandits makes up a resolution to hire samurai to fend them. After some initial trouble finding ronin who will accept a job with no real reward or benefit a team is finally assembled. It's the ultimate underdog story of tragedy, triumph, and even a few laughs.

148,28 November 2020,lyubitelfilmov,9, Ronin vs. Bandits or Japanese Annihilation,"Historical drama. The second picture of the famous, legendary and cult Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, which is aimed at the eye of your favorite and most authoritative Russian film critic (just kidding!). In fact, it's just a legendary picture that passed me by for quite a long time, until now I got to it, and here's my brief opinion - Ronins against bandits. I will say right away that despite the cult status and a huge army of fans around the world, I still found flaws in this picture, and I will write them, no matter how fans try not to notice them, and of course I will not forget about the merits. Therefore, sit back, pour strong tea, and enjoy the review of the legend of the world cinema.
So, the advantages:
1. The story told - Japan at the end of the sixteenth century. Sengoku Jidai - the era of the warring provinces. A civil war has been raging in the country for many years. Blood is pouring everywhere, fields are turning into places of fierce battles, devastated villages are burning everywhere, bandits are in charge of the roads. Inhabitants of one of the villages are harassed by a gang, and they are in despair, and for protection they hire seven ronin, who must end the gang. The script skeleton has been repeated many times in world cinema, the most famous and successful attempt is the American Western ""The Magnificent Seven"" (which I watched, and the writers were able to perfectly adapt to the Wild West, and not stupidly copied the scenes, as Sergio Leone did). The story does not shine with originality, but it catches with the elaboration of the characters and well-written dialogues that allow the viewer to feel the characters and begin to empathize with them. Akira himself was again responsible for the script, and again he coped with this task perfectly. And while there are a few rustles in it, that doesn't diminish its overall quality. Moreover, such a story could have happened in reality. If you like pictures with a good and thoughtful script, where you don't even want to find fault, then you definitely come here.
2. Atmosphere - Japan during the civil war, with its familiar attributes: samurai (here mostly ronin), their swords, feudal system, oppressed peasantry, horrors of civil war, and so on. The sets and costumes perfectly complement this unique and inimitable Japanese culture. If you love this, you are welcome.
3. The relationship between ronin and peasants - at first it seems that the peasants are the most unfortunate people in the country (they are all oppressed, beaten, and no one cares about them as long as there is no need to collect taxes), and after twenty minutes I sincerely sympathized them (the actors literally got used to the role), but later, as the characters were revealed, I realized that both peasants and ronins are people in whom both good and bad are combined. There are no angels and demons here. Some demons gave birth to others, some brought misfortune to others. Through dialogues, we begin to understand this tumbling and gradually the history of this and similar conflicts in this country is revealed to us. And also the romantic line, which exacerbates these relationships and contradictions between peasants and ronins.
4. Defending the village is not just about swinging ropes and sticking bamboo sticks into the bodies of hated bandits. Rhonin use tactics and think strategically, which reduces the chances of bandits, although they have a large numerical superiority, to zero. Fights and battles are dynamic, although it will be difficult to call them exciting.
5. Humor - Akira added a good humor to the script, which could make me laugh (and I'm sure not only me) completely sincerely and shamelessly. Bravo Akira!
So the cons:
1. The finale - don't you think, it is logical and expected, and filmed just fine. One only embarrassed - the understatement, and exactly where it was needed. I understood the symbolism (not a fool), the conclusion is also clear, but for the understatement I personally will never forgive Akira!
2. Duration - three and a half hours - this is the timing of this picture. Well, thanks for having an intermission in the middle. And don't get me wrong, long timing allows you to tell the story in great detail, without omitting details. But there are moments here that Akira has clearly drawn out, especially the long and languid looks without words. This is symbolism again, but Akira, could it be made shorter? After all, the tone of the picture practically does not change, and if you do not focus on the story, you can completely calmly fall asleep, and wake up only at the end.
Well, the battle itself cannot boast of the spectacularity of the battle today, but let's make a discount on the release time of the picture.
A little about the main characters:
1. Shimada Kambey performed by Takashi Shimura is the leader of the ronin and the most experienced warrior of all, and also the ""brain"" of the entire defense. He shows himself as a good person and an experienced military leader who fights well himself. Takashi perfectly embodied this image on the big screen.
2. Okamoto Katsushiro, performed by Isao Kimura, who has impudently become a student of Kambey, whom the latter uses as an ""errand boy"" and protects in every possible way. He shows himself as a brave and brave warrior who intends to become the best samurai. Isao played this role no less convincingly.
3. Kikuchiyo performed by Toshiro Mifune is the most interesting and memorable ronin in the company. He behaves insolently, funny and very resourceful, more than once helping out the heroes. He is also a tragic character who hides grief behind the laugh. And his monologue in one of the scenes is just great, especially with emotions. Toshiro was able to surprise me this time too. Bravo Toshiro! Bravo!
Honestly, it would be better to call the picture ""Seven Ronin"", but then there would be consonance with 47 ronin.
Well, there is only one picture left ""Dersu Uzala"", shot by Akira, joint production of the USSR and Japan.
As a result, we have an excellent historical drama of the legendary Akira Kurosawa, with an excellent script, great atmosphere and humor, costumes and sets and great acting work.",

Director Kurosawa was finally nominated in 1986, and given an honorary oscar in 1990. i'm surprised that he hadn't won for any of his earlier works, which were large, full, epics. Hidden Fortress. ""Ran"" was nominated for a couple, and won for best costume. Back to Seven Samurai, in 1954. Stars Toshiro Mifune, of course; they would make 25 films together! Kikuchiyo (Mifune) rounds up six other ronin to help defend the town against the coming invasion; the invaders are waiting until the crops are harvested, and will swoop in for the easy payoff. Kikuchiyo isn't really a samurai, but needs the meals that come with the work. famine. rain. misery. Takashi Shimura is Kambei Shimada, who turns out to be the real leader of the defenders. like most Kurosawa films, it's very big, and dramatic. and so many scenes just go on SO long. i guess because he was such a force in japan, no-one had the authority to tell him to make cuts. most of his films are great, also but SO long. Good story. very well done, if you have the patience to sit through it.",
152,13 July 2009,fearsomez,6, The film of its time,"""Shichinin no samurai"", also known as ""Seven Samurai"", is a film by Akira Kurosawa released on 19 November 1956. It was a Japanese film about a small village that was having trouble with a group of forty armed bandits. The village hires a samurai to help defend the village. The samurai Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) determines that he will need six other samurai to defend the village. The total of seven samurai trains the village how to defend themselves. They end up using a cunning strategy to cut some of the bandits off from the others to take out several at a time. At the same time there is an underling story of romance. This film is a very interesting film that uses filming techniques and quality far beyond its time. Akira Kurosawa was one of the first to use multiple cameras to get different angles. It has the action needed to catch the viewer with an underling story of love. It shows seven people who got together to help a village in need, which created a bond together that will last a lifetime. The village had a great victory defeating the bandits, but the samurai lost, in that they lose several of their new found friends. For me, this movie is a very inspirational film, which shows how friendship can be formed in even extreme times. It has the quality needed and the length to have a well formed plot that is difficult to see with many of the shorter films that they have now. Many films try to catch the viewer with special effects and attractive people, but this film did not have that option and had to use the plot and amazing filming techniques to attract the viewer.",
153,3 May 2005,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,10, Shichinin no samurai (1954),"What can one say about the legend that is Akira Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai'? Well it is my favourite film of all time. If i'm asked for my opinion, I would have to say it is quite perfect. Kurosawa pretty much invents the modern action film we are all familiar with. He brings together a team of highly skilled hard-men, each with their own distinct characteristics. They are hired by a small village, in order to protect them from bandits who will soon come and steal the harvest. The samurai arrive in the town, being promised a place to stay and three meals a day. They start to work out tactics and train the farmers. The beauty of this film is first present by the fact that it is over three hours long but flies by faster than many films that struggle to make two hours. Watching 'Seven Samurai' never feels like a chore. Kurosawa also perfectly mixes everything like a perfect recipe. There is hilarious moments of comedy, supplied by the brilliant Toshiro Mifune and the quick witted Minoru Chiaki. Also a very sweet romance blossoms, and never feels as though it is bringing down the rest of the film. Kurosawa also makes sure to never show anybody as perfect, the victims (farmers) prey upon wondering samurai, like those they now need. The ferocious killing of one of the captured bandits is also quite disturbing as the samurai's are against the killing. Each character is well explored and serves a specific purpose, the film clearly shows how the samurai would not be successful if they had any less men. The performances are nothing short of spectacular, with Mifune as the eccentric and misunderstood hero, and Takashi Shimura as the reserved and warm leader. The film also has its fair share of brilliant action sequences, such as the early slow motion sword fights that reveal the samurai's skills. Kurosawa paces the film perfectly, and uses the locales to his advantage. Despite being in black and white the film seems as though it is in colour due to the clear spaces and use of scenery. The script is excellent, with each piece of dialogue being important to the story. Sure the film could easily be less than two hours. Villagers hire samurai, they train for a bit, and have a battle. However 'Seven Samurai' never feels like it is outstaying its welcome. The final battle is amazing and exciting with the rain pouring down, the numbers against the samurai, and the brilliant use of editing techniques thanks to Kurosawa's multiple cameras. Overall this film is beyond explanation, there is too much and it is simply perfect, fantastic, amazing. Watch it, experience it, love it.",
154,10 February 2007,travised87,10, One of those films to watch before you die!,"When you have undergone a journey, you feel, that a change has occurred, that there is some growth, some learning and development within you that was absent at the start. Many films you watch, start at point A, and after the end, bring you back to point A. This film however, carries you along with it, so you feel part of the events that have unfolded before your eyes. At the beginning, you are thrust into the suffering of the village folk, their pain and desperation. As the film progresses, you get to know them, that they are more multi-faceted than first perceived. At the end, however, it is the samurai than you connect with, and like them, the euphoric singing of the farmers seems alien and distant to you. So you start the journey with the farmers, and finish it off with the samurai. Yes there is a melancholic feel that is not freed from the film; what's more is that it is what we can connect to better than any joy displayed in bouts. Such is the mood of the film that the ambivalence of life is inextricably linked to it.",

157,22 May 2008,russian-movie-fan,8, Long & Boring Good movie,"So whats all the hype about this movie? I've watched literally thousands of movies in my life and decided to see this one. Well, in 2008 its dated and very quaint. There are two impressive things about the movie that today's audiences will appreciate. 1) The use of camera close-ups on faces to accentuate plot points and tense scenes. 2) The use of camera to film action sequences in the last 30 minutes of the movie. Those are the best things in the movie and were revolutionary in its time. So for historical purposes, one can argue that this was important. However, these two novel techniques don't overshadow the fact that the movie is slow in its pacing, runs much too long with quite a few irrelevant scenes (the girl-boy in the woods scenes are out of place). In fact, another problem with this movie, is that for western audiences much of the context surrounding the life of the samurai and Japanese life are simply absent. Without any historical knowledge one is left w/many questions about the actions of the characters in the movie and the motives behind them. In short, it is a good movie that you should watch once for its historical significance, but there is not much that you can take away from it (as a modern viewer). There are too many action movies that have come along that are much better filmed and more captivating than this movie. Like a one-shot wonder resting on his laurels, this movie keeps getting more famous as the years go by for some novel features that it introduced. Although captivating for its time, by today's standards this piece of cinema is simply good but not great.",

That being said, I have tried to keep my review from being too effusive even though I would give this film the strongest possible recommendation.

It was well deserving of winning the 1954 Venice Film Festival's Silver Lion, as well as the two Academy awards it won for Best Art/Set Decoration and Best Costume Design. On a first view it's simply a great action film, but with subsequent viewings the finer points of characterization come through in each moment, seeping into the mind subliminally and purposefully. The story, at nearly three and a half hours in length- including a five minute intermission, is never weighted down with fat, as all of the many subplots bear fruit- so unlike most films made in Hollywood today.

The hills surrounding the small village are magnificently captured, the wind blows, the dust is stirred up, and when it rains, the mud replaces the splatter of blood.

I haven't thought about it before, but many problems need to be often thought and need to be thought over and over again.
I have always known the power of faith. But now, in this impetuous social environment, how can I see my ""belief"" clearly, the beliefs of these people I have come close to are just family and face. I wonder if I am narrow-minded, but it is the case.
The things you are pursuing gradually become more and more similar, and then you start to make comparisons inside and outside, and then you start to feel unbalanced and unhappy.
Eat yourself and dress warmly. But this is far from enough, and let the whole world know how full you are and how warm you are. The more people who know a good deed, the happier it becomes; if no one knows it, it feels like it's not worth it.
How vulnerable are people's hearts now? How desolate is the heart now? If this continues, one day, the yellow grass will die, and there will be no leaves; if this continues, one day, the world will turn upside down and return to chaos.
Before such a world comes, I still want to keep my pure land, I also want to keep my ""belief"", nothing to do with the house, the car; nothing to do with the face, the inside; no flattering, no bowing, no flattery, no compromise, no Look back.",

That's about as far as I got both times I tried to watch. The acting is absolutely terrible. Perhaps it's better if you can understand the dialog, but I had to rely on the subtitles (which don't bother me at all). The story is that a small Japanese farming village is routinely plundered by a band of outlaws. So the village decides to hire some Samurai to protect the village. The part that I've seen is completely spent finding and hiring the Samurai. And it's totally boring. This is the basis for such films as ""Young Guns"" and ""The Magnificent Seven"", which are good.

The samurai are really the stars of the show: interesting and fleshed out characters that you really love during the course of the film. The relationships between the characters are also interesting. It's true that this film is quite daunting: black and white, quite long (you can see it in two times, there is an intermission even though it has a bigger emotional impact if you stay with the samurai for the whole film straight) and subtitled.

191,8 December 2010,jboothmillard,9, Seven Samurai,"I read the description of this film given in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I was surprised to find out that it was remade into The Magnificent Seven, so naturally I wanted to see the original source, from director Akira Kurosawa. Basically, set in the 16th Century of Japan, a poor mountain village in the country is constantly being robbed, looted and made fearful by an armed gang of marauding bandits causing them to lose their rice crop. The villagers have finally had enough and decide that they need outside help to both defend themselves, and get rid of the thieves once and for all. Warm-hearted veteran samurai Kambei Shimada (BAFTA nominated Takashi Shimura) is approached by young samurai Katsushirô Okamoto (Isao Kimura)to be hired to defend the village, and he gladly accepts. Together, along with two of the town's farmers, under the advice of Kambei, they leave the village to find six other samurai warriors to protect the lands. They successfully find and recruit four skilled fighters and swordsmen, Gorōbei Katayama (Yoshio Inaba), Shichirôji (Daisuke Katô), Heihachi Hayashida (Minoru Chiaki) and Kyûzô (Seiji Miyaguchi). They had originally planned to leave with just these four men, but they spot clownish but skilled samurai Kikuchiyō Okamoto (BAFTA nominated Toshirô Mifune), and with everyone's encouragement, Katsushirô is secured as the seventh samurai. With the promise of three free meals a day the seven samurai look forward to their arrivals, but when they get back to the village with a fearful reception, but don't worry, things settle. Kambei gets to work immediately on the battle strategy against the gang of thieves, and the other samurai start training the people in the village to be ready for any incoming attack or raid. There are forty bandits in total, and the first attack gets underway, with a good amount of the opposite side being brought down, but of course there has to be a casualty. Gorōbei was shot and killed in the first attack, Kikuchiyo's friend Yohei (Bokuzen Hidari) was also killed in action, but the samurai and villagers are determined not to be beaten in the second bandit brawl. Kyûzô suffered the fate of the second attack, and the final attack finishes off the gang of thieves, with Kikuchiyō being the final samurai to meet their maker. In the end, the three surviving samurai, Kambei, Katsushirô and Shichirôji look over the villagers looking happy planting their new crop, and the graves of the other four warriors. Also starring Kamatari Fujiwara as Manzô, Yoshio Tsuchiya as Rikichi and Yoshio Kosugi as Mosuke. Being three hours and ten minutes long I was expecting to doze off and have to rewind at some point, but with great acting, the training and fight sequences, historical detail, humanism, the final battles, but also clever editing and speed techniques, this black and white is a masterpiece of foreign cinema, a brilliant classic action drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Very good!",

We, screenplay writers can learn from this movie that the first hint of idea is the most important fact to write a great story. If you get this idea, you can write Seven samurais or Magnificent seven.
And the great screenplay of Seven samurai made the movie looks like real. I think this movie is very real. Just like it's taken in 400 years ago. There are no great movie like this which is showing more than 200 years ago so realistic.

200,5 July 2000,revival05,10, One of the best movies I have ever seen.,"Year after year I have lived with PULP FICTION and STAR WARS as favorite movies, without even knowing that there were some movies who aren't just movies. A perfect example is SHICHININ NO SAMURAI. Just the fact that the movie spins on for 3.5 hours and never ever bores is remarkable. Akira Kurosawa has made a movie that is simply one of a kind, and he didn't need any psychologic riddles or complex scenes (BERGMAN) to do it, he just did it. The story of human's right to live, human courage and war is hell no matter which time is maybe the most powerful ever, certainly one of my biggest movie-memories from now. The seven Samurais that the title means, actually have similarities to the seven dwarfs. There is a leader, the strong, the angry, the shy etc, etc... That was my first thought in this movie. This is also a movie with lots of genres all in one. Something that I love in a movie. It is intense all the way. At first it is a tragedy, everything seems hopeless, even more hopeless with the search of samurais in the city. Well then the movie proves that there is a light in every situation. A proof is when the bum gives Shimada a bowl of hot rice and sais ""go ahead and eat, they give you the finest they've got"" and he sais ""yes I hear you, don't shout"". He turns to the farmers and say ""I put value on your sacrifise"". There is a moment of movie magic, ladies and gentlemens. It seems brighter for every minute. The company finds five samurais and a little more suspect character (but the most poulair from the movie), Kikuchiyo, in an excellent performance by Mifune. Well, what can I say? The rest of the movie is a pleasure. The acting is flawless. There isn't one bad acting performance in this movie. That is very, very rare but I really mean it, I can't seem to find one flaw. Not in the editing either. The fight scene with Kyuzo and that cocky guy is a classic. Just look at it. ""What a waste"" I believe Shimada says during the attack. Well, what can I say. He's right, but it was one professional waste, I can tell you.",

213,3 September 2019,Carrzinho,7, Seminal but at times sedentary,"Well, some movies are labeled epic and this certainly falls into that category tipping the scales at 3hr 21min. It also falls into the Citizen Kane category in that its massively influential predating almost every western of note and every western in the grittier second wave including the Magnificent Seven which would transition from ""influenced by"" to practically remade. No shortage of pedigree then.
Seven Samurai are hired for the meagre price of food and board to save a poor village from the annual pillage (and rape) at the hands of a gang of 40 bandits. Each of the Seven samurai are well written and easily definable characters in their own right. The villagers are more homogenous but there are a few fleshed out a bit more to provide interest, pathos, humour or indeed a love interest.
While the main cast are generally convincing a huge amount of the ancillary roles are irritatingly overacted. There is plenty of good humour to be found but some of it verging on childlike. There are far too many ""by numbers"" moments that fail to give credit to the viewer in what is often a subtle piece of work.
While 3hr 21min is no doubt time consuming, i've never found it off putting. However, there's an effortless hour to be shaved off here. I never expected to learn so much about rural farming or geographical warfare tactics. The aforementioned Magnificent Seven manages to cut a full hour and 13 minutes without compromising a facsimile of the plot. It doesn't result in a better movie movie but it takes a good wedge of slog out of it. It also justifies the motivations of the ""heroes"" better than Kurosawa's version.
I mentioned Citizen Kane earlier specifically and could easily have mentioned perhaps Night of the Living Dead. These movies all have incredible legacies but while all very good they are not exceptional movies in their own right. They do remain essential viewing though. There is so much to love about pacing and characterisation, filming action, dealing with grim and gritty subject matter that it warrants your attention. It is also true that because it is so influential, that many of the idea's and stylings have been more successfully implemented in latter years and likely in movies you've seen. So at times you'll find yourself watching this movie more for how it has influenced movies thereafter than for the movie itself.
In summation if you're a cinephile tick off a box here. If you're looking for what is a high calibre western try The Wild Bunch or The good, The Bad and the Ugly. If you want to experience Kurosawa, i'd argue that it's not even his best work, preferring Yojimbo or Rashomon myself. SEVEN",

Apart from the fact that it is technically perfect, this is one of the most influential films of all time. From today's perspective, the film tells the story that has been seen many times, but this is because the Kurosawa's version has left such a strong impression that, in the following decades, many filmmakers were inspired by it. The most famous remake is the western ""The Magnificent seven"" (1960), which tells the same story, and even copies some scenes, only places them in Wild West and replaces the samurai with the gunslingers. Each frame of this film is a perfect black and white photography, the story is well developed, the characterization is convincing, and the performance is excellent (even to those like me who hate over-acting and exaggerated drama typical for Japanese). I could point to a couple of weaker points in the story and acting, but that would be only a subjective impression that arose from the personal taste and cultural gap between the East and the West.

This is the strength of the film as the characters are never just obligatory archetypes. Each of the samurai is so distinct - a wise elder, an impassioned young man, a reckless glory seeker and more. This creates so many great scenarios as they try to defend the farmers, all with their own motivations and methods.

Compared to what little I have seen that came out of the 1950s, the storytelling here is truly epic. However, unlike many classics, this film didn't hit me like I expected from one of the consistently most highly rated films of all time. While there is great camera-work, great characters and engaging action, the film lacks the intimacy that a three and a half hour film ought to have. To its credit, the film is not too slow except for the beginning at times, but to say this film has a wide and trans- generational appeal is a stretch.",

The age of the film, coupled with the fact that it's a daunting 3 1/2 hours made me hesitant to even watch it. But once I set my mind to it, whoa-ho I was in for a treat. I could not believe how good this movie is! At first I was watching it in the background while I did other work. However, after only 20 minutes, I was struck with the intense character development in the film. All other distractions aside, I focused on the film for the remainder of the time and sat mesmerized at the sheer quality and emotion that was captured by the director. I've watched many, many movies over the years, and I quickly lose interest in a film as I suffer through formula and predictability. Not so here. A rare treat. I'm actually going to keep this a while longer so that I can watch it again with the commentary! There truly is a reason why this is considered a gold standard. Bravo. (03.24.08 nf)",
229,10 August 2015,smatysia,8, Samurai behaving badly,"This is a pretty good movie, but not the best ever, as so many seem to think. What struck me, were the many deviations from samurai culture, something Japanese audiences would be extremely cognizant of, since this culture was only finally crushed in the war ending just nine years before this film. One was at the beginning, when Kambei 1)shaved his topknot to pass as a priest, and 2) did so to save a non-samurai child from a kidnapper. A samurai would have little, if any, concern for such a child. Also Kikuchiyu passing himself as samurai when not born into it. Samurai was a hereditary caste and it would be unthinkable for any Japanese to claim a status he was not entitled to. Also, even the main plot about defending the farming village from bandits. I realize these men were ronin, meaning samurai not in service to a particular liege lord, but even so all of these things would have been dishonorable, and samurai would rather die than behave as such. Kurosawa had to be acutely aware of these things, so it was obviously deliberate. It likely had to do with Japanese politics and mores of the time, which escapes me as a Westerner.",
230,28 June 2014,dwpollar,7, Effective drama about a group of professional fighters...,"1st watched 6/21/2014 -- 7 out of 10 (Dir-Akira Kurosawa): Effective drama about a group of professional fighters(aka. Samurai) who are hired to fight and defend a small village from a group of bandits that have been terrorizing them for awhile. The Samurai(originally seven) teach the villagers more than they expect as well as providing them with a more promising . What makes this work is the storytelling and the relationships that occur between the villagers and the Samurai. The Samurai provide very elaborate defenses for the village and a scheme that works to allow them to handle the bandits. They also train the male villagers to be a part of the battle and get them to realize their potentials. The movie is slow in it's development and not really a hard core action movie like it is advertised but more of a story about how this community is established and how they interact. Yes -- there are battles(mostly in the last half of the movie) but the results are pretty inevitable because of the preparation. The villagers start out as meek, shallow people who allow others to stamp all over them -- but they are transformed by the Samurai before the end of the movie to a stronger group more equipped to handle life in general. There is a small romance thrown in involving one of the younger Samurai with a female villager but this is there primarily to show that the villager's original fear about the Samurai overwhelming their woman is not true. The Samurai are not paid for this endeavor -- they are basically given very meager room and board(which shows the character of those who were chosen). A young Toshiro Mifune was the only actor's name I recognized but I'm sure the whole cast is very well known in Japan due to the major hit this was when it came out. This classic film is definitely worth the viewing even at 3 and 1/2 hours.",

Seven Samurai was my first movie from the filmography of this wonderful japanese director and I can say only one bad thing about - it's long. Unbearably long. Don't take this the wrong way, I like when the movie pushes boundaries of running time and shows you the greatest story that you enjoy watching every second. Gone with the wind. Ben-Hur. Lawrence of Arabia. Even the silent ones, Dr. Mabuse and Die Nibelungen (which both are over 4 hours) have got that something that glues you to your seat until the very end. It's the story. The story that doesn't allow you to leave for a second. Sadly it's not the case with Seven Samurai. Maybe because the story itself isn't that exciting and the plot is very simple so you can easily skip some scenes, delete an hour of running time and it will be perfect. A masterpiece. And again, don't take this the wrong way, this movie is a masterpiece. The characters (especially Kikuchiyo), music, cinematography, editing, locations; everything was superb. Except for the fact that you could easily fall asleep starting 35 min mark running time.

So if you are not familiar with the work of this Master Director then start with this movie and if you already are a fan then this is a must watch, re-watch. Numerous movies have been made in the line with this subject and some of them are really good too but this Japanese masterpiece which was made more than 50 years ago, is still a treat to watch for many moviegoers. The story revolves around a village which is frequently attacked by forty some bandits which makes the village to hire seven samurai's (fighters) to save them from the attacks. Movie then deals with how the samurai are hired one by one and then how they prepare for the fight with bandits and their work in the village. It also depicts the suffering of the villagers and samurai too at the same time as they are out of work. AK's direction is superior, camera work is excellent, screenplay is tight and the acting by most of the actors are good but the stand out performances were by Takashi Shimura as the leader of the samurai and Toshiro Mifune as a samurai who acts as mad man and fools around all the time. These two actors are among the best Japanese actors and have worked in many movies with Kurosawa. Nothing more I can add about this movie which is not already discussed by someone or have been repeated in some other movie, so I would just say grab this movie and watch it, don't go by the length of the movie, as you will enjoy it very much if you are into foreign movies, or even otherwise it's a good watch. 10/10.",

You can also see the cowardice of the peasants when the samurai comes to the village and the villagers. The cunning, selfish side. They have looked down on themselves from their bones and regarded themselves as particularly humble. As you fight against the warriors together, you can also see their honesty and courage. This is the authenticity of this movie. Each warrior has his own personality. As a commander, the reconnaissance guards already know how to lay out defenses based on the map. Kikuyo, as an orphan from a farming household, seemed crazy and arrogant, but he actually understood the inferiority of the peasants.

Eventually through thick and thin an experienced Ronin (Takashi Shimura) aids the villagers plea and assembles five other Samurai, including a mischievous jester (Toshiro Mifune) who eventually proves his worth.",

282,16 June 2004,PeterRoeder,9, The most incredible display of macho power,"No movie has ever had the dignity and power of this one. It is struggling with ""Space Oddesey 2001"" about being the most impressive movie ever made. Each scene is like a splendid painting. The characters are astonishing. At first I didn´t like the Mishune character but he gets stronger with each viewing. He shouldn´t be confused with the Yojimbo/Sanjuro character though in later Kurosawa samurai films. Mifune plays a kind of peasant samurai here who transcends his karma which is like The Dark Knight of 1980s Batman comics. The same goes for other scenes and characters. This movie has had a vast influence on other artworks. The ""leader"" samurai is very impressive in his leader role as well and also the master swordsman. As well as all the samurais. And the beautiful girl who is the young samurai´s love interest. The Buddhist philosophy of this movie is obvious. I cannot stress how much power and dignity this movie contains. Especially, male power, I guess. In that way, it is like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or something. However, the lessons to be learned by ""7 samurai"" are not to be missed. Watch it with ""Akira"", eat rice, meditate and fight.",
283,16 March 2002,bix171,10, A Masterpiece Both Epic And Intimate,"Akira Kurosawa's magnificent film combines an insightful meditation on the strategies of war with an equally brilliant examination of what drives people in their struggles to survive. Kurosawa's beautiful black and white depictions of battle (including the stunning finale taking place in a rain storm) are offset by some very moving subplots involving forbidden young love and the thankless task of defending those unable to repay and unwilling to respect. For many people, Toshiro Mifune's rollicking extrovert Kikuchiyo is the most engaging character; but for me, Seiji Miyaguchi's quiet, committed Kyuzo is the film's center: he epitomizes the sacrifice and resolve that audiences gravitate to with admiration. Kurosawa works with passion and intensity but he's quite willing to stop for a moment to admire the natural beauty of the surroundings or to share a hearty laugh with the viewer. The film is always impressive--the wonder of it is that's impressive in ways both epic and intimate.",

Akira Kurosawa`s ""Shichinin no samurai"" is gonna make you see cinema with different eyes. It's a long film, and the first 60 minutes is a little boring, but then you get into the mood and you just can't stopping looking at the screen.

It's a 207 minute long movie in which every single scene is necessary, and everything is essential to moving the story forward. In spite of being so long, it manages to remain eminently watchable because, save for a tiny bit at the very end, something new happens every single time. The characters are perfectly acted and all are interesting and fit into the story. The tale manages to stay simple, but epic in scope - it's easy to see the plight of the farmers, but it's also easy to see how scared they are of the samurai invading their way of life, especially in the beginning and middle of the movie.",

That is a impressive number for any director, but it is even more impressive when you consider how many of theses are truly great films. Because of this choosing the greatest Kurosawa film is no easy task. I've always been partial to ""Ikiru"" as my favorite Kurosawa film, but ""Seven Samurai"" is a close second. For those not aware the basic premise of the film is a group of seven samurai are recruited to help defend a poor farming village from invading bandits. That may sound like a simple plot, but this film is far from that. The film is a complex and rich story told in three acts. The first is the recruiting of the samurai, the second is the preparation for battle, and the third is the battle. At over 3 hours long one would think this would be a boring film, but it isn't. The film is excellently paced and never drags. This is due to the great story, well-developed characters, wonderful performances, great action scenes, and, of course, Kurosawa's fantastic direction.",

Basically it's a fun action story about a group of samurai defending a village from bandits. The magic comes with Akira Kurosawa's attention to detail in every single aspect of the film. It's the kind of movie that can be watched over and over again, and be entertaining every time because there's new pieces to see every time. Everything from the way each samurai acts/moves differently, to the interactions of the villages, to the pacing that keeps the whole movie interesting (including the hour-long setup), to the use of musical scores in the right place; not to mention things like camerawork and framing and background/foreground. It's just a masterpiece - a work of art. There's a reason it's influenced so many great films and great directors that came later.",

I love Bruce Lee films and Steven Segal films as well but cannot fathom why these films are so popular. Give me Jackie Chan any day over this dribble. Why isn't Enter The Dragon up above these artsy pieces of garbage. Why not Pokeman for that instance at least there is some humor in that. I would rather watch Dragon Ball Z, Ghost in the Shell, Akira, The Fist of the North Star both versions, Blood Sport even Ultimate Fighting Championship six over this set of movies. I hated Karate Kid and feel that it is an insult to the martial arts but it still is better than this movie set. Have I made my point yet? I hope you never subject yourself to this dribble.

One character that really stands out is Kikuchiyo, a wild reckless showoff that gives zero respect to anyone but later we learn more about the character, about who he is and why he does what he does and for me his arc is one the best thing in the movie. Despite its 207 minutes runtime, it was an easy watch. Kurosawa's smooth storytelling is one of the reason for it, there are so many well developed characters and the action scene is thrilling, the stake is clear and the sequences are easy to digest. While it was technically a violent movie it is not its main point, it touches on so many things about social caste, affection, humanism, empathy, and friendship.",

The Farmers finally decide that they are not going to take it any more, and resolve to hire unemployed Samurai warriors to fight for them. That is essentially all there is to the basic story although, naturally, there is a lot more to it.

Akira Kurosawa's magnum opus (speaking of foreign) is a tour de force of cinematic style, fast-paced and exuberant action, and most importantly, magnificent characters.  This film is not a sanctimonious, solemn foreign picture.  On the contrary, 3-1/2 hours won't feel like enough as you see the seven brave swordsman use cunning, skill, bravery and humor to transform a village of cowardly farmers into a team of spear-wielding warriors. It is a shame that so many American moviegoers fear subtitles and exotic tales of centuries ago, because many of them won't give ""The Seven Samurai"" a chance.  But this film is a must-see not only for film buffs who want to see great writing, acting, cinematography and directing, as well as the archetype for the American western, but also for anyone who loves tales of heroism, love, war, revenge, or just a grand old time at the movies.

306,23 December 1999,jmcody,10, A work of art. That's all one can say,"Akira Kurosawa was perhaps the finest filmmaker the world has ever seen. Certainly influenced by other masters like John Ford, Orson Welles, Jean Renoir and others (reading his autobiography says so much), Kurosawa found a way to take their impressive visual styles all his own. He also perhaps became the one director to managed to make visual novels. Seven Samurai is but only one example of what he was able to do not only visually, but narratively as well. Many film makers set out to make art and fail becuase they overlook the absolute necessity that novels, films and plays require a captivating linear narrative that contains interesting and realistic characters placed in exaggerated and urgent circumstances. This does it. It not only contains breathtaking action, three dimensional characters and phenomenal performances (Toshiro Mifune creates arguably the finest physical and presentational performance ever caught on film) but speaks poignantly about what it means to be a human being. Like all great works of art, it transcends language and culture.  It's scenes are not so much scenes as they are chapters in an epic. This ranks right up there with The Odyssey, The works of Shakespeare and the paintings of Van Gogh (another influence of Kurosawa's). It is that important and significant to the history of human artistic achievement. This is not to be missed. A 10 out of 10!",

The first time I watched this work of art I was blown away with joy and amazement due to just how super director Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece really was and I only wished I had listened to everyone else's comments on the IMDb Site much sooner. In fact Seven Samurai was so good I had to watch it again the next night to get all the brilliant scenes of this epic tale into my mind forever. Then I watched it again last Saturday and only after viewing it for the third time do I feel worthy enough to comment on this early 1950's classic. Well to start, the story is wonderful, the acting is truly outstanding, the Japanesse locations are beautiful and the script is super.

312,11 May 2018,JaydoDre,7, Interesting but fails in a couple of crucial aspects,"The story of the Seven Samurai is not a cliché but it is treading an existing type of movie, namely a type of movie in which the story builds to an important event. This event will test several characters, showing how they deal with the said event and with one another. Normally, the formula to such a movie requires the first 80% of the movie to be devoted to showing the backstory of each character who will be present for the final event. This is necessary because you have multiple characters and you need to understand the backstory of each of them as well as the relationships between them in order to understand and fully appreciate their behaviour during the final event. Seven Samurai gives a little bit of an introduction for each character, but not much. Not long after seeing this movie, I have completely forgotten 3 out of the 7 samurai.

Some movie researchers have spoke hours and hours about the movie's many levels, how the story works no matter how you look in it. I must say that I agree. Still, I must say that the movie is little a bit too great for me, I have hard time finding all the symbols and levels of the movie. Also Kurosawa's way to describe things, it's so clear and so human like, almost too realistic. I considered it long time to give this movie 10, like I gave Kenji Mizoguchi's Victory of Women. And if I have to evaluate this movie from the view of it's achievements as a story about Japanese life, or historical content, I would no doubt gave the movie full points.

However, I enjoyed all of it and who cares if the stabbings looked fake and we never actually saw any blood? The director more than made up for that with RAN. Kurosawa was more interested in a good story than grossing out the viewer with a boatload of Hollywood blood. Why does Hollywood figure that the more gore you show, the more realistic it is? The story is fascinating, although some of the seven samurai characters were underdeveloped. This is what good cinema should be. Make a ovie good story, and everything else will follow.

These are a few choice rentals I really enjoyed.  While I still have a long list of classics and modern-day marvels to go, I feel like I have seen some great flicks. The latest movie that was recommended to me by the Netflix gurus(that rating movies thing really works) was Seven Samurai. The only time I had ever heard of Kurosawa was in a Bare Naked Ladies song.  After reading a bit about him and some of his other films I will be sure to delve into his large assembly of cinema.  Seven Samurai is his best-known film, so it was a good place to start. The movie lived up to or outdid all promises of critics, historians, and fans.  I utterly enjoyed this film.  I even watched some of the commentary feature on the DVD.  Compared to the afore-mentioned films I would have to rank this one atop them.  I gave a few of those movies a vote of 10 and I sincerely meant it.  With this film I would vote 11 if it was possible.  There is really no need for a plot description in these comments as I only want to convey the extreme admiration I have for the movie and all involved in its creation.",

Inspired by American westerns, it is only fitting that the film was later adapted several times to that setting. There's little depth in this movie, compared to Kurosawa's other pieces.  It is just pure entertainment, dealing briefly with issues such as honor, mismatched lovers and solidarity. The movie feels a little long nowadays, and it does take some time to get started.  But this setup pays off later on. Battle plans are explained before hand so the public can follow the action sequences in the same way a general can.  And once the battle begins, you won't be able to stop watching. Mifune steals the best, funniest and of the most memorable scenes in the movie, as an infiltrated soldier in enemy lines.

People say, on appreciating it you should realize it's an old movie and that by means of the cinematic it was very revolutionary in its days. But why then is there a total lack of that approach with respect to other old movies? Why should I suddenly be so scrupulous on seeing The Seven Samurai? Because of its icon status? Well, I don't agree. Sure, I enjoyed the film, for me it had its good moments, but not more than an average other movie. In fact, most of the time I felt embarrassed to my wife, looking the film with me and to whom I had recommended it because of the lyric reviews. I expected something quite different.

The cinematography is fantastic and often ahead of its time. This is no surprise if we consider Kurosawa's early training as a painter. Some of the shots remain in your mind long after the film has ended. The intensity of the main actors is sometimes nearly overwhelming in their portrayal of the emotional spectrum of human beings. Anger, doubt, courage, disillusion, humor and friendship are among the emotions that we are confronted with continuously throughout the movie.

Much too long in my opinion. It's three hours and twenty minutes about, and never does that time seem totally worth it. The characters aren't very compelling which makes me have trouble with actually getting attached to the story itself even if it is interesting. None of the characters for the most part go beyond a surface level of character development which leads me to not caring about a whole lot that is going on. That's not to say the movie is awful.",

403,14 December 2013,bryan-mconnor,10, an absolute masterpiece,"So many words come to mind in describing Akira Kurosawa's epic action drama Seven Samurai. This is filmmaking at its very best. This is an expertly crafted film that is grand in scope and delivers the ultimate viewing experience for the cinema buff. The plot is simple, yet the execution is immaculate, with great directing, wonderful pacing and great action scenes. The film combines elements of a drama and action film very well and there's enough going for this film to make it stand out as a definitive classic of cinema. Akira Kurosawa is a master of cinema, one of the greats and he has proved that with this outstanding work. This film is not for everyone as it is nearly four hours long and it focuses more on telling a compelling story than focusing on action. With that said, Seven Samurai is a beautiful picture that some great performances and is among the best foreign films ever made. What is surprising about this film is that director Kurosawa is able to pull off such a grand film using such a simple idea. The result is outstanding. Filmed in beautiful black and white, Seven Samurai is an epic picture that would influence films for many years to come. With this picture, Akira Kurosawa created new ideas that would be seen in many future releases. The reason that this film is so good is because the film relies more on performances and storytelling to entertain the viewer and it does that in spades. If you're not into epics or hate slow-paced movies, then this is not a film for you. However if you want to watch one of the defining works in cinema history, regardless, Seven Samurai is definitely essential viewing. This for me is one of the first grand epics of the 1950's and other would soon follow such as The Ten Commandments and Ben-hur. Seven Samurai is long, granted, but you can't deny its impact on cinema, and with that said, it's a masterful picture that is breathtaking from start to finish.",

405,1 May 2010,cutsman-2,10, THE Action Epic.,"Is there any movie more epic than this? Clocking in at three and a half hours, Kurosawa's tale of Samurais assisting a ""helpless"" village is a masterpiece. The story itself is rather simple but doesn't lack depth. It serves as an entrance into the lives of the people you will spend the next 3 and 1/2 hours with. A village of farmers is continually attacked by a group of bandits, robbing them of their crops. The villagers get the idea to hire Samurai to protect them from the bandits. They cannot pay much, a place to stay and a bowl of rice a day, but a group of Samurai still go to help the village, seven to be exact. There they create plans of attack and train the villagers. When the bandits do finally show up it is a battle to the death. Now there is a bit more going on here, but if you're going to invest in the film you don't want to be spoiled.",
406,1 June 2012,shanejcoulter,10, Kurosawa's Masterpiece,"i am disappointed to see that Seven Samurai has dropped slightly on the top 250 list, as it is without a doubt my favorite film of all time. Akira Kurosawa's epic tale about bravery and honor is three and a half hours in length, but i assure you, not a single second of this film is wasted. Kurosawa spends 2 and a half hours developing his characters in a way that in unrivaled by any other film. He develops and intense mob mentality of fear and selfishness in the peasants, that he masterfully contrasts with the brave, self sacrificing actions of the Seven Samurai. And so, after over 150 minutes of careful character development, Kurosawa ends the film with a one hour battle scene, that is not defined by intense action sequences, but by acts of valor and sacrifice, that truly bring the characters full circle. I strongly recommend this film, and i hope that the ""black and white"" barrier that plagues most movie goers would not stop them from watching this movie. It is truly a wonder to behold.",
407,10 May 2010,manjavhern,10, Great samurai movie!!,"I saw Seven Samurai for my film history class and was greatly pleased in seeing it. To see the movie that started off so many other cult classics such as the magnificent seven is very moving. The film itself is greatly done with so much going on in the three hours it runs. Yes that is correct three hours! It is a long movie to watch but very well shot. The movie is in subtitles, which does take away from seeing the movie fully, but it is much better than having horrible voice-overs. The movie is also in black and white. The movie is full of deep emotional moments as well as comedic lifting scenes. They are blended well together to keep the viewer interested and entertained. The movie drags on a bit, but it does give you much information about each samurai and the lives they live. The movie also shows the impact and change in each warrior and the villagers. The love relationship between the samurai and the villager was a bit of an annoyance but bearable. The end battle is very well done with many awesome battle scenes and deaths. I was very surprised with the arrow and sword battles, they were well done and very believable. Even in today's movies they aren't done half as good as they were done in this film. The last epic battle costs many lives but does serve its purpose and symbolism. The end of the movie with the samurais contemplating the cost of their actions and their lives is very moving and deep. This is one film every action buff and movie goers must watch at least one time in their life. You will not be disappointed. After watching the movie, go and read the BFI film classics book of Seven Samurai for a great deal of insight and information to enhance your experience.",
408,19 August 2006,akhil-jaggarwal,10, in memory of those seven samurais,"For a die hard fan (fan - its an ambiguous word) of old Japanese movies, especially those depicting Samurai and the agonizingly painful period of civil war, Shichinin no samurai stands alone and proud, proud of its every single frame, every single dialogue and lastly, proud of its immortalized characters. I've seen quite a few civil war movies, Seppuku ('62), Onibaba ('64), Sanjuro ('62) and nearly all of Kurosawa's flicks, but the difference in them and the Seven Samurai lies in its experience. A good one hour into the movie and you'd want to live with the characters, fight with the samurais, curse the bandits and fall in love with a girl. The storyline of this movie is of epic proportions, not even close to any movie you'd have encountered till now, and the way the minutest element of the film is handled, it just makes you sit and appreciate in awe. Every character is portrayed as if we've been living with them for years, just that they're now on screen instead of being with us. A sign of a good movie is that it lasts, a sign of an excellent movie is that it lasts longer, while a sign for a movie like this is that it'll embed itself in your mind and heart for a long long time to come, and you'll cherish every moment remembering it.

410,18 August 1999,ensiform,10, Perfect,"The best foreign film ever made?  Perhaps.  Every scene is classic, every nuance perfect.  The plot of this movie is very much in the American Western tradition.  A small village of farmers is being plagued by bandits, and they hire some ronin, or masterless samurai, to protect them.  All they can afford to pay the samurai is three meals a day, so it's a tricky situation. Even in the complete, three-and-a-half-hour long version, this film's action never flags for an instant.  The fight scenes are the most grandiose, dramatic and emotional I've seen (one of the few movies that makes the viewer actually care when the characters die).  It's also very subtle, with the viewer's sympathies being directed and re-directed as a new aspect of each of the characters comes to light.  The ""wild"" samurai's vindictive speech is a good example.  This is really a perfect movie.",

416,11 May 2010,mcnimitz04,6, Long Film,"The movie, ""Seven Samurai"" was released in the United States on November 19, 1956. It was directed by Akira Kurosawa. The movie was originally released in Japan two years earlier. The main downside of the film is that it is 207 minutes long. Since the film is so long, there is a lot of time that is spent on scenes that do not need to happen. For example the last hour of the movie is spent on the battle sequence where they just go back and forth. There were many other example of where the movie did not have to be as long as it was. However, the acting in the film was good. The samurai warriors in the film did a good job at portraying the thoughtful leader type. They always seem to know what to do. The story is about a group of samurais that are tasked to defend a small town against attacking bandits. It culminates into a big battle for the town at the end. The film seems to echo the horrors of World war two when the United States took over Japan. It could be argued that the bandits represent the Americans while the village represents Japan. Overall this movie was very well made. However the main drawback was that it was 207 minutes long. I feel that the length of the film draws away from the storyline. By dragging out the story like that, the film covers many scenes that do not need to happen. The storyline was almost too well developed. To the point where there was almost too much information that was given to the viewer that was not needed. However the actors portrayed their parts very well. There were some samurais that seemed to always know what to do and there were some that didn't.",

It's amazing how many of the scenes are exactly the same, i.e. the scene in which Toshiro Mifune's character catches a fish with his own hands. I could watch this movie everyday and never get sick of it, which is a credit to the film direction. I use this film to judge a persons character, in friendship and even relationships. If a person can't sit and watch this film then what could they offer? I think the only movie to match this epic is the return of the king.

It may not have gone many exotic places, much of it in one tiny village, but hey, neither did Titanic. But it's epic status is not what sets it apart from the rest; no, rather is its dramatic storyline and subplots, as well as very likable leads. Kurosawa's script (also a writer here) doesn't play this up as a period piece, thankfully refraining from anachronisms, and it says fresh in 2012 (although it was probably re-subtitled with the DVD release a few years ago). It also shows the Japanese humor that Kurosawa eagerly portrays in some scenes--genuinely funny, I might add--even if not full on comedy quality (it is a drama after all).",

Still, I watched the full movie and I'm pretty sure I'm better for it. The best movies take effort to watch, and this one took a lot of effort. But I learned something from it, the story ended up grabbing me, not right away, but at the end. Some of the scenes were amazingly complex, at times it looked and felt like total chaos for minutes! It's a rich movie, with many stories to tell, I've never seen anything like it, that's probably one of the reasons why it was so hard to watch, but I understand now why it's in the top 250.

The peasant, the samurai and the barbarian. You could say that it is moral in the sense that the good guys win. However I say it's somber because the noble samurai's don't get any goodness other then the ability to be of service, their pleasures are short lived and quick just like their intense battles. Whereas the peasants after victory will surely enjoy a long enduring peace. Another thing apparent in this movie is class, some samurai deny serving peasants and that is the last we see of them. Some although the barbarians get destroyed for their cruelty others simply move to another location.

At the ending, when the village people do not seem to recognize the samurai after they defeated the nobles, I felt remorse for the samurai and asked myself what they fought and died for.

As far as samurai movies goes, it was okay. Very authentic looking, but way too long, almost 4 hours. You could easily start at the intermission and miss nothing that is really interesting. There is some character development in the first half, but it's not critical to the second half. Some of the story line was just unbelievable -- any young man in his early 20's certainly knows the difference between a boy and a girl, and the girl wasn't trying that hard to look like a boy.

The director clearly was going for some nice scenery shots in several places, and the black and white didn't do justice to what obviously could have been some beautiful scenes. Realism is paramount in this movie though, I thought it gave an excellent depiction of life in the day.",

450,8 October 2005,yamagata@virtual-markets.net,10, An excellent snap shot of 17th Century Japan,What I like most about this movie is not the timeless themes of a small band of intrepid heroes set against large numbers of evil doers in battle. I like it because it gives insight into the history and the culture of Japan. It examines the caste system that was in place in 17th century Japan and what were the prejudices of the time in each caste. It also captures the true essence of Japan as a country that was based on a rice economy. That is the heart and soul of the country. The worth of a lord was based upon rice from the land that he controlled.,
451,24 November 2002,TexVanWinkle,8, A fine film,"I can't rate it as highly as most people here have, though.  Innovative, humane, and thoughtful, to be sure, with rich cinematography and some strong acting, all of which make it a film to be much admired.  It has its faults, though, partly in the editing--there are places it is needlessly fat, in my opinion--but namely, for me, in the acting of the supporting cast.  The overacting which seems to be a common curse of many older films is on display here, with wailing and gnashing of teeth a bit too earnest and plentiful.  And it can't be said that that's just a symptom common to all older films, because it's not.  Any number of older films--Casablanca, Singin' in the Rain, Ninotchka, The Philadelphia Story, to name a paltry few--put the lie to that myth.  Not least important, either, is the fact that I wasn't swept up in its story.  I was interested in it, to be sure, but I didn't connect with it emotionally like I do with the films I tend to rate better.  These are somewhat niggling criticisms, but for me, they are there, and enough so not to place it in the most rarefied air.  I can only give a 10 to a flawless film.

454,10 July 2001,tracy.carver,10, the movie that started all other good movies,"I loved it.  This movie is sophisticated and thoughtful filmmaking that is so much more than the simple title.  Wanna know where Coppola, Spielberg, and Lucas got some ideas?  Watch this movie to find out.  The acting is sublime -- the expressions and vocalizations are effective even to someone like me who knows absolutely no Japanese.  The music is wonderful.  The cinematography is subtle and effective, with angles and focus chosen to emphasize the plot elements and mood.  It feels highly realistic; the samurai aren't holier-than-thou lords of the sword wielding mystical powers -- they're merely trained men in a profession, men with thoughts and feelings.  The weak and helpless villagers aren't necessarily really that week and helpless.  And we aren't inflicted with atrocities perpetrated by the baddies so that we have evidence to make us pick a side.  There are no tiresome epic battles with the the characters drawing upon mysterious wells of strength to finally prevail -- they're just fights that happen as they happen.  I could go on.  Dang, this movie was good!",
455,14 April 2012,TKDLion8,10, Only one flaw,Really the only fault that I can find in this movie is that a couple of the seven were totally forgettable characters. I honestly didn't remember them from one scene to the next. This isn't something I would think about in a factual drama such as a film about the 47 ronin but this is fiction and there were only seven. This didn't decrease my enjoyment of the movie though.,
456,21 February 2012,xlix-298-152419,5, How can it be in the top 20??,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS To be honest I found this movie disappointing. I know that it is old and I was not expecting effects or anything like that (naturally) and for the first one hour it was exactly as I pictured it would be. I will admit that the movie is educating about the Japanese culture and lifestyle of the past and it has interesting and charismatic actors but the script has major gaps. The biggest fault and one that simply ruined the whole movie for me and especially the end was the way the villagers felt about the whole attack. Now, military tactics was invented by mankind far far far before the fifties so please don't think that I am being harsh on a '50s movie. The truth is that the scriptwriter and the director for some reason just decided to make everyone look stupid by making it like that. Here is what I mean: The approximately 150 villagers are attacked by 40 or so bandits (I forgot the exact number) on horses and having 3 guns. When they have already killed about three quarters of them and have stolen TWO of the THREE guns for some reason they start to panic and dramatize that they are all going to die the next day when the bandits do their final raid. By that time the villagers had suffered only a few casualties (not more than 10 as I could see) and most of the samurais were still alive. It doesn't take to be a genius warlord to say that this battle is already won. Anyone who had suffered such losses would never make a final attack against more than a hundred men inside a fortified village who have two of the three guns on the battlefield. The way that the villagers acted though was as if they are doomed and this really irritated me. Hence the grade of 5. Apart from that, there were other minimal faults such as at the end where the bandit chief's gun fired two times in a matter of seconds which for that kind of gun is impossible but these are minor issues. The lack of simple logic when considering the battle is the major minus of this movie and ruins the whole experience of what would otherwise be a 7.3-7.4 picture. I cannot see why it is in top 20 and why there are so many amazing reviews of it being ""EPIC"". It is everything else but it is not epic. As a whole, it is a good movie if you want to learn a bit of Japanese history but not if you want to see a good combat movie.",

459,1 June 2010,sselvaganesh,10, Akira Kurosawa was born to make this movie.......,"Akira Kurosawa was born to make this movie. Yes it might look exaggerating. But that's a damn fact. Start to finish directors talk of maintaining the tempo. This film does that with ease. Kurosawa's famous rain scenes appear without fail here too. The director always maintains logic in these rain scenes by not having dialogs. Mountainous terrain as the backdrop was just too good a setting for the story. It was 1954 and it took great courage to take shots that covered such wide angles. Also till the final bandit-attack and villagers' retaliation sequence not many will understand why this movie has been set in the backdrop of hills. Kurosawa's regular cast appear here too. Its a pity that even IMDb doesn't have their photos so i am not able to mention their names. Speaking of individual performances, the farmer who has a horrified look on his face through out the movie was a masterly casting idea by the director to say as though someone is traveling with us throughout our journey of the movie giving some part of the bandit-fear to us. That gave an ultimate feel of the movie. The role of Kyuzo was of course brilliant. The real samurai class. No fear whatsoever. Though Kikuchiyo role was quite emotional one cannot hide the fact it sometimes was irritating. Shichinin no samurai must probably be the best movie ever made in this genre of action/adventure/thriller/drama considering that at the time it was made even the great Psycho was not made so there was no reference to make a masterpiece movie.",

463,9 November 2015,ViswanathI,10, Seven Samurai,"Kurosawa was considered the most Western of great Japanese directors (too Western, some of his Japanese critics sniffed). ""Seven Samurai"" represents a great divide in his work; most of his earlier films, Jeck observes, subscribe to the Japanese virtues of teamwork, fitting in, going along, conforming. All his later films are about misfits, nonconformists and rebels. The turning point can be seen in his greatest film, ""Ikiru"" (1952), in which a bureaucrat spends his days in the rote performance of meaningless duties but decides when he is dying to break loose and achieve at least one meaningful thing.There is also an instinctive feeling for composition. Kurosawa constantly uses deep focus to follow simultaneous actions in the foreground, middle and background. Often he delineates the distance with barriers. Consider a shot where the samurai, in the foreground, peer out through the slats of a building and across an empty ground to the sight of the bandits, peering in through the slats of a barrier erected against them. Kurosawa's moving camera often avoids cuts in order to make comparisons, as when he will begin on dialogue in a closeup, sweep through a room or a clearing, and end on a closeup of another character who is the point of the dialogue.",

Yet, it grandly transcends all these possible limitations, and deservedly ranks as one of the greatest, most powerful films ever made.  If Akira Kurosawa were to be remembered for only one film, this one has my vote. I feel similarly about the late, great actor, Toshiro Mifune, in one of the leading roles as Kikuchiyo. The power and beauty of this film arise from so many levels. The photography is masterful, as are the story telling and direction.  The characters are fascinating and richly developed, the actors impeccable. The progressively dramatic action  sequences are authentic and unforgettable.

475,10 November 2013,drewconnor,10, The most entertaining movie i have ever seen,"Every fan of movies should see a Kurosawa, and this is (along with Yojimbo) the most accessible of his many great works. The film is an artistic and technical masterpiece, but above all it is a rousing adventure story, gripping and emotionally involving from the start. The origin of the film lies in an idea for a story Kurosawa had about a samurai who made a tiny mistake and went home and committed suicide. Told this wouldn't work, he and his writing team began researching the 16th century, and became interested in the fact that villagers would hire samurai as night guards to protect them from bandits, the samurai receiving food and lodging in return. This evolved into Seven Samurai, Kurosawa's greatest jidai-geki (period drama), about desperate peasants who turn to professional warriors when bandits repeatedly raid their harvest. Kurosawa draws fantastic performances from his cast, most notably Takashi Shimura (as the samurai leader Kambei, the living embodiment of the samurai code) and Toshiro Mifune (as the peasant turned warrior, Kikuchiyo), and marshals the elements for an astonishing climactic battle scene in the mud and the rain. This ten-minute sequence has to be seen to be believed; the images have a painterly quality (Kurosawa trained in western-style painting) but are also extremely realistic, perfectly capturing the chaos of the battlefield as figures wade through the mire, hacking at each other. I've heard it remarked that this sequence was in Spielberg's mind when he conceived the Omaha Beach landing scene in Saving Private Ryan; and indeed, the use of grainy film stock, the slightly speeded-up movement and fast editing, and the depiction of war as utter chaos all seem rooted in Kurosawa.",

You have a clearly defined good (samurai) and bad (bandits) side and then a somewhat ambiguous side (the farmers). The reason why the movie is great is not because of the classical story line, but the small details put in that exhibit alot of humor, bravery, and spirituality.

One village decides to do something about this; they will hire samurai warriors to protect their goods and their lives, for harvesting season is just around the corner.

The rest of the film details the misadventures of this motley group of people as they must quickly coalesce into a team to defeat the nasty warlords. The film is amazingly able to bring together many different genres to make a coherent whole. It is an adventure/action movie, funny, romantic, and genuinely insightful of human nature all at the same time. It is filled with brilliant images; director Kurasawa was a master of cinema, one of only a handful of directors born to make movies (see his Ran,  Kagemusha, and The Hidden Fortress, for example).

One of the easiest leaders to root for in all the history of film-making.

501,26 July 2003,caerlas,9, A masterful arena film,"Contains Spoiler I'd heard about this film for a long time. I am glad I finally saw it. This is the story of a village of people in post-feudal Japan who hire a ronin, Kambei, to defend their village from an annual raid by bloodthirsty bandits. Out of charity and a lack of purpose since the fall of the feudal lords he helps them find 6 other ronin to defend the village. These 6 other ronin are just as indifferent about their lives as the first and decide to take on the challenge of defending this village as well. Among the more compelling characters are Katsushiro, a young untrained son of a samurai who wishes to be a disciple under Kambei. Kikuchiro, played with flair by Toshiro Mifune is a scoundrel who poses as a samurai. Despite Kikuchiro's lack of discipline or honor, and his constant vulgar outbursts, he becomes one of the most endearing characters throughout the course of the movie because of his slyness and unstoppable bravery. Also look out for Heihachi, a fiercely disciplined ronin who has made the perfection of his swordsmanship the one remaining meaning in his life.",

Tremendous camera angles, directing and editing are all the best. The film does a great job of developing all of the characters, and really is a thought-provoking work of art; it's one of those movies that I thought about for a long time after watching it. Even more remarkable is the fact that this movie was made over fifty years ago, yet it is timeless in it's messages.

The film is well-done and addresses class issues as well as the idea of justice.  My only complaints (and the only reasons I did not give it a 9), and they are small, are that the characters' motivations were not explored as much as I would have liked and the strategy of the Seven for defending the village should have been more in depth because strategy is an aspect dwelt upon early in the film in several other instances.  Still, give this film its due:  it set the stage for many following (and sadly, lesser) American Westerns as well as Japanese films.  I own it, but if you are not a ""film buff"" I suggest renting it and then deciding if you should own it. It is long and unless you're really into the film it will seem to move somewhat slowly.",

Anyone who call themselves a cinephile ought to have watched this perforce. Gonna hit the high spots only 'cause boy do I despise those who in their review sum up the book's plot. If I need a synopsis I'll read the synopsis, people. First order of business- the length. I, personally , find the movie a trifle overly lengthy- 2h30 would've been perfect, the way I see it, and 1/3 of the movie was - let's call a spade a spade, shall we? - superfluous. Nothing really much happens in the movie. Everybody knows it all boils down to seven samurai endeavoring to put themselves out for a village of farmers, so we might just as well cut to the chase. If it were a Hollywood movie the same content would have to be fit in half the length of this one or less, namely 1h30, 1h45. This isn't to say that you shall squander time watching this one. But the action is indeed rather slow-paced, anyhow. Again, I'm not gonna make any bones about it- I take it that what accounts for the relative renown of the movie is the fact that it's a portrayal of a world ever so unknown to the European or American people -which makes it all the more glamorous. It outstrips in frankly no way whatever numerous American movies-apart for the setting. The setting metamorphosed an average-goodish movie in an exceptional one.",

His work has inspired future directors, writers, and even genres of film. Among his many cinematic triumphs, Seven Samurai reigns supreme. Kurosawa took his love of John Ford Westerns and mixed the ideals presented in those films with the samurai culture that he is descended from. Rather than draw from the noble myths that surround samurai, he used historical fact. Samurai after the fall of the feudal system became no separate from thieves, rapists, and bandits. This is a far cry from the romantic tales associated with them (the same holds true for knights in the Old World).",

In Seven Samurai Kurosawa creates a rather simplistic story of domestic turmoil and the relations of men. Akira Kurosawa has firmly established himself as one of the most vital film makers in the history of cinema and Seven Samurai is not only his triumph but also a film that's constantly observed both by critics and directors alike as a reference on how an epic should be told. As grand as the battles are in Seven Samurai it's the character's eccentricities that will leave the viewer with a vicarious sense of subconscious ecstasy. My conclusion of Seven Samurai is this, a film of true beauty one that delicately balances it's tragic notion on post war with humour and subtlety in addition to that Seven Samurai speaks a universal language and deciphers the message of the foundations of friendship and courage.",

Instead I got an excellent piece of action, suspense, drama and well-executed cinematography. As a film studies student, this film appeals to me on multiple levels. The story might not be that of Titanic, but it's one that pulled at my heart none the less. The characters are developed through moments that expand on their character in ways that create sympathy and attachment, almost forgotten in modern cinema. This film made me buy a poster simply because it was that good. I enjoyed the setting, the characters, the style, the performance and the direction of the art.

For example, I really enjoyed the older man that was always in the hut, he seemed to not really have a purpose except to lighten the mood a little bit since everything else was so serious. Another aspect I enjoyed was the relationship between the soldier and the young woman from the village. They seemed to truly be in love, when she thinks that they may never see each other again. Once the battle is over, though, the young woman goes back to her old life and seems to not be affected by this young man and therefore shows that she was never in love with him in the first place.",

If this same movie was made NOW with the a story but in a slightly different setting it would be massive. Change the samurai for an all star cast and give them guns and it would be a sure fire hit with the 'gung ho yeehaaa! brigade that have given this film one star. 3 or 4 I could get as its subtitled and some parts of the dialogue will be missing but one?

The meticulous development of each of the characters and the charisma of the lead actor were what made this movie not just an action movie but a timeless classic. The director made no concession to time and you are so involved that the extreme length of the movie does not work against it. You are caught helpless in the grip of the story as it moves to its inexorable conclusion. The camera work, the acting, the exotic setting, all combined to make a wonderful cinematic experience. I cannot think of this movie without linking it to his other great and unique classic ""Rashomon"" that tells the story of a rape in 4 different ways.

The director of this movie Akira Kurosawa, and this movie in particular, influenced George Lucas to create the Star Wars movies. It has also been the basis for The Magnificent Seven, Return of the Magnificent Seven, Guns of the Magnificent Seven, The Magnificent Seven television series, Battle Beyond the Stars, A Bug's Life, The 13th Warrior, Shane, Pale Rider, High Noon, The Road Warrior, Galaxy Quest, Woman in the Dunes, Yojimbo, and many others. It is a movie of courage and the power of temptation. It is not so much about the samurai coming to the aid of a community as it is of human nature within a small group of law men. In reality, it can serve as an example to military and officers of the law, that they can be corrupted, but that if they can stand above reproach, the rewards are the in the means themselves.",

The 7 samurai engineered the war such that they beat the bandits against incredible odds. Never in the history of film has a war been narrated so elaborately, efficiently, lucidly, and with great fun, lots of surprises, and unpredictable through and through. In this war, each killing counts, whereas in many of the wars portrayed in films, you don't feel s*** even when a thousand men is bloody shown to be wiped out by nukes. That's just one little thing making this movie stands out, and God, there are plenty more, so by the name of the Mother, don't miss this movie, and you shall see, Coppla's ""Aprocalpse Now"", and Wolfgan Peterson's ""Das Boot"", even Spieldberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" and George Lucas's ""Start War"" all willingly bow before this moive.

It's got so imprinted in my mind that a second time (a couple of years later) I could keep my mind above the plot to look deeper and discovered for myself a beautiful second sub-level of emotions which really thrilled me. I must say about it because I have read 5 or 6 reviews on this movie: only one of them barely resembled my point, and I refuse to think Mr. Kurosawa did not realize this 2nd level while making the movie. I am talking about its great Humanism which has 2 aspects. #1 - is a war. No other movie made me feel so vividly that killing each other, no matter how great or noble is your cause, is always, ALWAYS, an evil, horrific, dirty, unnatural thing which is going to haunt its participants forever (may be with an exception of, well, samurai, who probably really believed in what they do). Yes, you can kill somebody to save the World, but - in the end there might be nothing to be proud of. #2 - is the purpose of human life. It stunned me that the percentage of people you meet in your life who are - A) selfish B) don't care and C) doing good deeds - is roughly the same as a number of - A) bandits B) peasants and C) samurai heroes - in the movie. What Kambei says in the end about whose victory it is (and knowing what price 7 samurai have paid for it) reaffirms the notion that those of us who are doing good deeds must remember that you should not expect a reward for it, and the only true reward you can get is within yourself. And it still is as elusive as that famous wind which goes through all Kurosawa's action. I am happy now: next time I watch it I will discover something else.",

551,20 August 2020,noahmed,1, Don't Waste Your Time!,"Seven Samurai, is a Japanese Film from 1954. It's a black and white film, and is considered a classic. I don't see this as a classic. I see this as a film that was possibly great in its time, but did not age well. Time has not been kind to this film/ I personally do not feel that the average movie goer, would get pass the first hour. Let's talk about what I liked. First off, the acting is good. Each actor fits their character and thats fine. The Direction is good. That's really it. This film has a lot going against it for today's age. And that is how I am going to conduct this review, from a viewer in today's age. What I didn't like is majority of the film and its aspects. Let's start with the big one, the movie is Three and a Half Hours long. When it does not need to be. The first hour alone could be cut in half and it wouldn't take away from the main story. Which brings me to my next grievance. The plot of the movie doesn't come into play until an hour of the movie. I was sitting waiting for something relevant to the plot to happen and by the first hour when it happens. I have lost all interest in the movie. Another factor is the pacing is awful. The movie is 3 hours and 27 minutes, it felt like 4 hours or more. I was constantly checking how long I had left. One last thing is you really don't know whose who. You have these characters that are thrown into a scene and it's never really explained who they are or what their purpose is. I had such high hopes for this film because I heard it was great. But, I was given nothing but what was a great film in it's prime that lost it's meaning and watchability over time.",

I understand where this movie belongs in film history. However, Citizen Kane is not in the top 20, and if that doesn't make it for historical significance, then nothing should. Let the movie stand for itself on all levels not it's impact on filmmaking. The movie is epic, in length. At just about thee and a half hours long with what I am sure is amazing Japanese dialogue but the subtitled translations are not very compelling. I fell asleep several times during this marathon of a movie. If I were to rate by historical significance though: 10",

I first saw 'The seven samurai' at around the age of six or seven. Though I enjoyed the film- I hadn't realised its sheer brilliance until a later age. Earlier this year, my dad received 'the seven samurai' on DVD as a gift. I watched it and was blown away.",
556,20 September 2001,A person who will always like films,10, Kurosawa's effortless masterpiece,"This film's greatest appeal lies in the fact that, due to Kurosawa's great skill as a filmaker, the power and precision of this story is pulled off effortlessly. In 'The Seven Samurai' you will find a film that is simple in its greatness, and uncluttered in its storytelling. Simply put, I have found this film to be the most impressive foreign language film I have ever seen, and one that rivals the best of all films ever made.",
557,4 May 2010,butler-britney,9, Shichinin no Samurai,"Wow what an epic. It was a little difficult to get over the 207 minutes of the film and the slow pace of it. Once that barrier was broken the film was extremely entertaining. Akira Kurosawa was definitely a visionary that created an influential film. Kurosawa was often looked at for delivering the vision of classic Japanese culture, and it was done through his films. Shichinin no Samurai (Seven Samurai, Akira Kurosawa, Japan 1954, 207 min.) is a film that achieved success on so many levels. Seven Samurai is about a poor town that hires seven Samurai to protect them from Bandits. Each Samurai represents an archetype which allows for almost every audience member to identify with at least one character. My personal favorite was the sword master Kyûzô played by Seiji Miyaguchi. Throughout the entire movie Japanese culture is beautiful illustrated with stunning visuals and comedic dialogue. I am actually extremely impressed with the director of photography and editor of the film. The long shots, and the extended amount of editing that had to occur for that length of a movie is beyond extraordinary. There is no doubt in any mind that has seen this film, that Seven Samurai is very literally an EPIC film that will continue influencing cinema gloabally throughout time.",

Kurosowa's directing is unlike any movie I've ever seen. Every scene is masterful in its own way. Mifune's proformance alone makes this film a automatic 10. His character is hillarious yet ferocious at the same time. The movie's several plot strands weave together into a beautiful tapestry of Action, Drama, Romance, and Comedy. This film is definately a 10.",

560,26 March 2002,Fellowship Films,10, Kurosawa's Masterpiece,"The Seven Samurai is a genuine epic notable for the simplicity of its plot and action and the complexity of the character development. In 16th century Japan and in the age of upheaval and civil disorder, seven, as it were freelance, samurai warriors are employed by desperate villagers to protect them from the annual raid on their crops and produce by a group of bandits. This is the stuff of westerns and was remade as the respectable ""The Magnificent Seven"". But what the American film lacked was the code and honour of the samurai- qualities unknown to employed gunfighters. By emphasising these things along with the Japanese caste system and thus revealing the paradox of samurai warriors fighting and dying for peasants, people whom normally they would treat with disdain, Kurosawa presented a story that was simultaneously familiar and alien. The climatic, rain-soaked, mud-spattered battle scene with the camera swooping and wheeling between samurai, peasants and bandits is brutally realistic. The overall blend of savagery and nobility, subtlety and broad humour makes what is essentially an action/adventure movie into something quite magnificent.",

As much as the movie is about the samurai that battle and sacrifice themselves for these villagers, I was captivated by the shots of the landscape, and that of the village and the samurai town where they all meet. They are beautiful and its downright scary on how authentic everything is, especially considering that now every action movie uses CGI to create a lot of the stunts and backgrounds, its incredible.

Seven Samurai is one of them. While Spirited Away is right on it's back, Seven Samurai tells an amazing story, where a Samurai is in desperate need of help because a village is in trouble, so he grabs 6 other Samurai, those 6 Samurai's would help him defend the village. And that's the story, although the movie is well over 3 hours and 27 minutes, I think you'd be entertained, because it's just Seven Samurai doing funny running away.

In fact, I thought this film was going to be tedious to watch. So, when I put it In my DVD player (or PS2, take your pick) at half ten last night, I decided to finally sit down and watch Akira Kurosawa's ""masterpiece"" knowing that it won't be finished until half 1 in the morning. When the last scene finished, one word was left in my head, Perfect. This film is nothing short of perfection. And it wasn't the action that impressed me the most; it was the character interactions in the scenes leading up to the climax.

Man, I was not disappointed! it's funny, it's tense, it's generous and the level of humanity in it just blows my mind away. Some people says it's too long. For a reason I could not view it in its entirety, I had stopped half way and couldn't wait to resume the next day. It was like a little break and this did not displease me at all. I enjoyed most of it although to be honest, at the beginning I found one or two scenes slow but this was rapidly forgotten thanks to the humour added to the movie. Yes some scenes just cracked me up, particularly scenes with Toshiro Mifune. He was great in this role. I love the friendship among the characters, their sincerity and modesty. I only watched one movie of Akira Kurosawa before (Dreams) and honestly I kind of fell asleep in front of it but I probably need to give it a second try. I think Seven samurai is a gem, those who didn't like it simply did not get it, or were not in the mood to appreciate it. It's all a question of mood.",
574,9 September 2014,satya-kiran,10, A Ripping Yarn,"Watching this movie was like reading 100 Years Of Solitude. The director has recreated the world in this little village that has been beset by bandits. Much imitated, still unsurpassed. By critical consensus one of the best movies ever made, THE SEVEN SAMURAI covers so much emotional, historical, and cinematic ground that that it demands to be viewed over and over again. Director Akira Kurosawa re-imagines the epic westerns of John Ford in a Japanese context, yielding an art-house action picture with cross-cultural appeal. I love the authenticity and realism of this movie. It might be a tad long compared to today's standard but there is no wasted scene. I love the characterizations and the stories of each of the seven samurai. The fact that any one can possibly find anything wrong with Seven Samurai is just bewildering. This is a classic example of truly deep cinema that will never be able to be recreated. Simply breathtaking from the performances to the sets, everything is outstanding. Kurosawa was famous for being a perfectionist when it came to his sets and it shines through here. The villages look incredible and everything looks perfect, including the costumes. The action is without par and extremely realistic, which adds to the sense of realism and drama unfolding before us. A perfect film.",

However, as soon as I actually settled down to watch it I was captivated from start to finish and the 3 hours flew past!!! This film has everything - action, suspense, humour, romance, heartbreak, and a lot more, and combines them all effortlessly! It is (as I'm sure you already know if you're reading this) the story of a village who hire seven samurai in a bid to ward off bandits who they know will be raiding their crops and families when the harvest is over. There are so many different personalities and all provide something different to the group's dynamic. You cannot help to be amused by the antics of Toshiro Mifune as Kikuchiyo!!!

577,27 March 2005,phoenix-ks,10, One of the Best Movies ever!,This is Akira Kurosawa's (one of the greatest directors ever) greatest masterpiece. It is film-making at its best. With amazing performances across the board (my personal favorite was Toshiro Mifune) it has some of the most memorable characters of all times. However the best thing about the movie is the direction Kurosawa captures every moment of the film perfectly. There is not a single wasted frame in its entire 3 and a half hours. It jumps straight into its magnificent story with its opening shot of a villager witnessing a group of bandits decision to attack and rob the village. The villagers then proceed to hire 7 Samurai to protect the village. But that is not the only plot in the movie their are a number of subplots. Some of the most memorable scenes in the movie are the 3 battles which are some of the most amazingly filmed in history. I highly recommend this movie as it is unbelievably entertaining and should be required viewing for any film buff. If you haven't seen this movie yet go rent it and watch it as soon as you can!,

Just read some of the lower reviews. However I am happy to say that seven samurai was able to live up to the hype for me. It is beautifully shot and acted. I cared about every single one of the characters. Each samurai is distinct and memorable and you sympathize with the villagers. It is a movie I believe I will enjoy more and more with each subsequent viewing. The movie is long at 3 1/2 hours but I was able to watch it in one sitting no problem. The movie is also surprisingly heartwarming and had many great comedic moments. The chemistry between the actors was great and the way Kurusowa handles the films themes is respectable.,

The subject matter is downright brutal in many aspects ... taking a sword to get rid of your foe is up close and personal. There is no hiding from behind a building or a tree and firing a weapon. You are forced to get basically within arms reach and figure out a way to get the other dude before he gets you. I can highly recommend this movie, and be prepared to watch it more than once. Let this one kind of work on you a bit. You won't be disappointed.",

The characters, each with their own small set of traits and ingredients, make a perfectly flavored team. Each of the samurai had 2 or 3 overwhelming traits which I found made the characters simple, yet intriguing. Like the young samurai that was still very childish and naive yet he volunteers himself for everything. The wannabe samurai that is always trying to prove himself annoyed the heck out of me for awhile but then he grew on me. Kurosawa is long, really long; he definitely has a sense of story telling that reminds me of a story a bard would tell, (probably in the same length of time). I particularly like the battles, and the way the samurai fought, there wasn't any Hollywood choreography, yet they clearly were skilled fighters.

618,15 September 2005,george_russell,6, Best movie of all time? Don't think so.,"In my quest to see all of the top movies on IMDb, I watched The Seven Samuri, and I have to admit that it's hard for me to understand the hype. Granted, the movie is over 50 years old. Whenever I watch an old film, I try to put myself in the seat of someone at the time the film was made. The special effects and other things we've become used to when watching modern films were just not available at the time the film was made. I can understand that. In understanding when the movie was made, I found many of the scenes wonderfully done. Unfortunately, the film has MAJOR flaws. First, at 3.5 hours, the film is incredibly long. I don't mind long films, but a long film has to keep the viewer engaged the entire time, and this movie fails to do that. I had to take short breaks just to get through it. Some of the ""amazing"" acting seems like overacting to me. Who acts like that in real life? And worst of all, the story (and here's a bit of a *******SPOILER*******) isn't entirely realistic. How stupid are the bandits that keep coming back for more. They could get the job done when there were 40 of them. What made them think they could get the job done when they were reduced to 13? Now, how realistic is that? *******END OF SPOILER***** This film, while possibly great in it's own time, should be watched now with moderate expectations to avoid disappointment. FYI - this is my first post on IMDb, although I've been using the site for years. I thought this film was overrated enough to warn others who might spend 3.5 hours watching it. Enjoy!",

625,9 April 2008,echoplxx,10, Kurosawa's Pioneer style,The Seven Samurais is indeed one of the greatest movies ever made. Kurosawa has done brilliant work especially with the perfection in fight sequences which every director today wants to achieve but does not even get close to him. Further I would like to comment on the style that Kurosawa adopts while he plans out and details each character in his film. Every character has his/her style and depth that they are able to pull out in the movie which I don't think every director can demand and attain from his/her cast. A lot of symbolism is used in the film which not only limits itself to the characters in that time or space but each one of those characters who are related to that particular situation or scene. I believe a lot of movies draw inspiration from Kurosawa's style of film making and the future movies will continue to do so.,

His work is incredible each and every movie never the same and yet having a lot of the same actors. Not a lot of people could handle doing that. Seven Samurai though would have to be Akira Kurosawa's greatest work. The pace of the movie is put together greatly making you want to see what will happen next.,
629,26 June 2005,l-john206,10, A masterpiece of cinematic arts,This is my Holy Grail of films. I find this film goes beyond an apparent story line but moves by way of it's subtext to a metaphysical and transcendental awakening in the viewer. The yin and yang of a life and death struggle. The grinding conflicts of man inhumanity to man in a world that is not surreal but in a black and white reality ( the real world). Kurosawa is a man of vision with a profound sense of creativity in cinematic language. The cast is so superb and it's probably the closes that one will get to perfection in an epic ensemble of characters. Toshiro Mifune? A master of revealing inner conflict and pathos. I look at this film as a balm for my spirit to be renewed. It's a film that can only be described as a cosmic force that has a message for the viewer that looks at humanity in it's chaos and societal degeneration and finally it's rebirth.,

637,1 December 2007,cadrega_82,9, All in Japanese!!!!!!!!,"Had been looking forward to seeing this film for some time as my film studies lecturer at Bangor Uni used to rave about Kawasaki's films all the time. This is the 1st Kawasaki film I've seen and I can honestly say I don't want to bother with any others. If it was dubbed it might have notched my approval rating up another mark but this is all in Japanese and so you have to keep pressing pause to read all the dialogue - yep! There's a load of talking in this film - and towards the end my thumb was aching so much that I could hardly be bothered. What was supposed to be a 3hr 10min film became, with all the necessary freeze-framing, a whopping 5 and a half hours. Not bad if you have four eyes or no job to go to in the morning. This is not a PATCH on any of the readily available dubbed Japanese films like Bruce and Ang Lee's efforts. Was prepared to give it a go, under the illusion that even though it is in B&W there must be some pretty impressive fight scenes to justify its reputation, but was left sorely disappointed. The acting is totally unrealistic: everyone just shouts angrily at each other. At one point the village is stunned because some guy is chopping his bobble off - WHAT? For real fans of Japanese cinema I recommend Tom Cruise's virtuoso performance in The Last Samurai. Defintitely give this one a miss, unless you have a beard and glasses and want to dupe a girl into thinking you're cultured as part of some bourgeois seduction technique - but be warned, she might just DIE OF BOREDOM.",
638,2 October 2004,diggerjohn111,10, quite possibly the greatest.,"This is possibly the greatest film ever made. Samurai has influenced every one from Kubrick to Spielberg and Lucas. How can you say anything bad about a film by the greatest master of film, Kurosawa? I think Kurosawa's greatest achievement in this film is the fact that he managed to make the viewer ""see the color"" in a black and white film. I think this film also shows that you do not need a billion dollar budget to make an amazing work of art. Akira Kurosawa can best be described as a director that has a film genre all to himself that directors can emulate, but can never duplicate. The ideas of the film were also revolutionary, the notion that a samurai can show human weakness was a new one in Japan at the time the film was made. Kurosawa not only gave the Age of Japanese Shogunate wars a human face, he also made it presentable to the Western film viewer. There is nothing in this film that any human being cannot sympathize with and I think that is the greatest gift that this film, and the entire collection of Kurosawa's films give to the world.",

First, I think this film is high drama, great comedy, intense, has story complexity, and shows a side of Japanese culture few in the West get to see. Second, while film opinion must have a subjective side- whether you like a film or not, think it's exciting or boring- there must be an objective side, as well. You have to take the film for what it is, not what you want it to be. Keep in mind the year the film was made, don't expect Terminator special effects, and try to remember that so much of what we see today was influenced by this film and this director. There are pre-Kurosawa Westerns and post-Kurosawa Westerns put out by Hollywood, and the difference is obvious. Clint Eastwood made a name for himself playing the American version of Mifune's samurai, and with much less wit and charisma. And I like Clint Eastwood. No big deal, though, just my 2 cents.",

It's not because the music is good or because the storyline is interesting (they aren't), but Kurosawa succeeded in making a movie which has proved to be a great omen of things to come. It combines action and humor in a way which is now frequently done, without losing the audience's attention. Also, this movie is in many ways more related to western movies than it's related to pictures filmed in the east. Whereas most other movies made at the same time in japan contain a moral, this one is obviously fixated on bringing an entertaining action movie without the irrelevant social messages. It's no coincidence this movie was remade, as it's concept (the good minority which ""defeats"" the bad majority) is the basic idea for almost all current action movies.

Although the film spawns out over three and a half hours, once a viewer is caught up in the many aspects of the film such as true character development, the culmination of relationships and ever mounting progression towards the stories climax, time becomes of no importance! Akira's methods of engulfing the overall plot into many different aspects of characters lives which involve love, hatred, leadership and the ability of a community to come together as one too fight the common enemy. I have read many reviews which are critical as to the length of the film.I however find that only a matter of one's lack of attention span.

That fact alone is testament to Kurosawa's incredible skill as both writer and director. The balance of artful visuals and narrative is perfect and every character is fascinating and perfectly played, especially Toshiro Mifune's gleeful and almost feral glory hound and Takashi Shimura's good hearted but wily Ronin.

Akira Kurosawa has created an true epic motion picture that is not only historically perfect down to the smallest detail but has presented a moral philosophical film with many layers of messages. For later contemplation. This is my personal all time favorite movie. The quality is so intense that colorization would ruin this film, every scene is nuanced, and full of subtleties that escape most western viewers so one must carefully watch this film several times, it is worthy of a full semester of study in any film school. My favorite scene is a dual in the early stage of the movie that was copied in the Magnificent Seven Film but in the Seven Samari Kurosawa shows us a slice of the interactions of the Samari Class of 17th Century Japan. Another great message in the film is how fire arms and technology have poisoned conflict and warfare. I mean in the film Kurosawa displays the training nobility, courage, and skill of the Samari against overwhelming odds. Yet since the bandits have firearms they are able to kill them without every showing themselves in a very cowardly manner, in fact you never see them firing and killing any of the Samari, you only hear the report and you see a brave Noble man fall.

Akira Kurosawa has taken the tale of the legendary samurai and turned it into a incredible film. From the unique plot(that has been copied numerous times in american westerns) to the classic and loveable characters, to the awesome fight scenes. Everything in this is picture perfect! This movie has made me fall in love with samurai films(i had already loved kung-fu films) and made me want to see some of Akira's other classics like Yojimbo and The Hidden Fortress. You need to stop reading this and buy this classic right now if you havent already. Rating: 10/10",

His greatest, and undoubtedly his most popular film was in 1954 epic Seven Samurai, which was the top-selling movie out of Japan for the year and won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Picture.

This film is what every movie should be it defines great film making. This includes but is not limited by: amazing character development, superb plot, luscious scenery and most of all it has a point.

While it's not necessarily my favorite film by Akira Kurosawa, it is definitely his most powerful work. Toshiro Mifune steals the entire movie, Kikuchiyo is a character that no one can forget. He has a great deal of character development and has the most investment in the battle. The conclusion of his life is nothing short of heroic. The style Kurosawa brings to this, like all of his films, is outstanding. Everything is extremely well planned and precise. The look of the film is utterly beautiful, the final battle is perfectly dark and tragic. There is an incredible sense of imagery that cannot be forgotten as well. I think it's a movie that everyone should sit down and see at least once. It is truly an epic, clocking in at 3 1/2 hours, but it goes by so fast that you don't even notice it.",

-The presence of the samurai alongside the graves of his friends reminds us of the memory of the struggle or pleasure of the struggle.
-The distance between the samurai and the peasants is the destruction of the memory of myths in the minds of the villagers, and the most beautiful of the unlucky love of the ""Katsushiro"" and ""Shino"" are the defining isolation of these people. ""Kambei"" confesses the bitter truth:

The exciting action sequences are just so smooth, the way Kurosawa uses movement is so incredible. You're left there stuck to the screen watching all the samurai talk, normal conversations become so interesting. You're given time to learn about each character.

Halfway through, I was thinking, gosh, its already half over? while towards the end I was longing for it to go on.  At 3 hours, 20 minutes, its as long as two movies combined, but it wouldn't be possible to cut a single second.  On the way to the car, I had a desire to rent it on my way home and watch it all over again.  My first reaction:  I cannot believe how good that was - why can't all movies be this good?

I pity that the Indian cinema even after those 50 years couldn't make at least one movie like them. This is not to say that there were not many good ones. Let's hope that some new directors with thinking brains and talent would come up with even better movies.

Although they fight with sword, spear, arrow and the movie is in B/W but the realism in so similar and you got to remember that this movie is in the 50's.

The quiet resignation of the down-on-their-luck older samurai, or rather, rônin, the eagerness of the young samurai Kikuchiyo wanting to prove himself, the desperation and fears and inital greediness of the peasants, all intervowen to an unsurpassed saga of an insignificant sideshow of the Warring States (sengokujidai).

Also scenery and film locations are chosen with care and the wardrobe designers have done a awesome job with everything. Quotes from Akira Kurosawa: With a good script, a good director can produce a masterpiece. With the same script, a mediocre director can produce a passable film. But with a bad script even a good director can't possibly make a good film. For truly cinematic expression, the camera and the microphone must be able to cross both fire and water.

703,20 June 2011,pvdmeer,10, One of the best films I ever saw,"This film is not overrated. It deserves all the praise it can. It's an epic but with -real- people. The characters, even the heroes or peaceful farmers, all have their moments of weakness. Moments where they are vulnerable, despicable or ugly. This is something which I have failed to see in mainstream cinema ever since the 1980's. Somehow, cinema has become a schizophrenic art. Superheroes and super villains on one side and the arty films about weeping losers and the stench of humanity on the other. Wouldn't it be better if we could combine both sides of the story? Who seriously believes a 110% altruistic hero saving the day? Is that a good way to inspire the movie-goers, or is it just offering an escape, nothing more? And who believes narcissistic nobodies ever getting past the stages of teenage angst and actually making their lives interesting enough to put on film? The thing about Seven Samurai is, most of the characters have their weaknesses. But they face them, rise above them and make the world a better place. Of course, that would fit the Star Wars trilogy as well. However, Star Wars chose to replace the background of every day human life with midgets in suits. The same thing goes for the strategy portrayed in the film. It goes beyond the action movie ""hit em where it hurts"" type plan and is actually more complex than the ones portrayed in most war movies.",
704,14 August 2005,miyamachi,10, Greatest Film Ever *****,A masterpiece. After viewing a documentary on Kurosawa and learning that his older brother walked him through Hiroshima after the bombings and told him to never forget the horror I am surprised he completed as many films as he did with what little sanity he had left. Genius is always clouded with misery and Kurosawa shows this in many of his films. Unfortunately he had to conform to the military's demands in his early years but clearly breaks out with films like this. Anyone who has not heard of this movie should move out from under their rock on mars and check it out. This movie was filmed on a remote part of Japan and took almost three times as long to make as originally planned. Dig it or don't dig at all.,

727,9 July 2004,7th_SaMuRaI,10," Quite simply, the best movie ever made, and the best director ever to make a film.","I don't normally post my opinion on websites, but to see a reputable website that actually acknowledges eastern cinema, and puts Kurosawas work at the top of the list is a great joy to witness. For too long we have been plagued by Hollywoods overdramatised nonsense high budgeted action flicks, and its a shame to have to go all the way back to the 1950's to experience the greatest work within this genre. Seven Samurai is a timeless classic. Very few action films withstand this test of time, becoming corny looking after the special effects or visual style becomes out-dated. You have to remember though as you watch it, that everything was done for the first time. Allot of the great Hollywood films, stole directly content from Kurosawas films. With the greatest western directors like Spielberg, Lucas, Scorcesee, and Coppola all confessing that Kurosawa had been the stronger influence in most work they had created. However that is not to say that Kurosawas influences were not solely of Eastern origin. John Ford, Sergei Eisenstein and Frank Capra had all been deeply influential to Kurosawa, and Kurosawa was, in his time criticized for employing a very Western style in his works.",
728,10 March 2019,EmrecanVATANSEVER,8, Seven Samurai,"Describes the story of the samurai who has disregarded his life to liberate a poor village from looters. It's an epic movie. In Japan, militarism collapses. The military loses its power. Hence strong weakens the weak. Bandits attack villages.The individual has to sacrifice himself to the group has an approach. Selfishness pragmatism is questioned. There's loyalty.",
729,12 September 2004,blackie788,10, A movie better than this has never been made,"Has all the elements of a GREAT movie; it is number 3 on my list of all time favorites. I don't think there will ever be anyone who can come close to Kurosawa's level of directing, period. The casting is superb, each performance is absolutely sublime. This is a movie that you want to last and last, you don't even realize the time going by. The musical score was fantastic as well. There is not a moment of wasted film in this movie. I've watched it many times an I never get tired of it. It was not until I saw a documentary on Kurosawa that I realized the research and effort it took to make this film and the attention to even the most minute detail. I don't see many movies any longer; the stuff the Hollywood machine is churning out is utter crap. I don't think they have a single clue as to what people really want to see. It would serve them well to watch this movie, although it could never, ever be replicated, they could learn a lesson in how to make a ""perfect"" film. Toshiro, you're still my HERO!",
730,18 September 2004,drbshahi,10," In my opinion, best movie ever made.","Directed by Akira Kurosawa, this is truly a magnificent movie (actually, The Seven Magnificents is the American copy of this epic). The movie depicts a very realistic and, at the same time, heroic story: villagers devastated by a group of bandits employ the services of seven samurai to defend their village. One should be familiar with the basics of the casts in 16th century Japan, as well as the codes of the military class (Bushido) to have an in-depth understanding of this movie. However, even without the least knowledge of these issues, one enjoys this movie. The Story is perfect, acting superb (Takashi Shimura as Kambei Shimada and Toshiro Mifune as Kikochio, in particular) and cinematography first-class. I give it a 10/10.",
731,20 May 2005,jsutherland,9, Responding to the pretext that this is the best film ever made,"A return to Seven Samurai helped to confirm that this is one of the best films ever made. Modern films in this genre sparkle because of choreographed brilliance, but this plot/script shows structure and brilliance that don't depend on cinematography or special effects but on a a great screenplay, great character development and phenomenal direction. You forgive the stylisation and stiltedness of some of the performances because you recognise that this is an attempt at reproducing folklore in black and white in a culture which is unfamiliar and untainted by the dominant American/Western culture. While this film was made more than 50 years ago and shows a 17th century Japanese culture it still carried relevant messages for today regarding the futility of war/violence as a solution; the role of women in society and the divisiveness of arbitrarily determined class structures.",
732,23 October 2004,ryuji_009,10, The canon by which all other films should be measured,"Shichinin no Samurai, or Seven samurai as it is called here, was one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Akira Kurosawa's masterful direction, combined with the impeccable skill of the actors, brings forth a movie that is so much more than a movie. In essence Shichinin no Samurai is a look at the human condition. The differences in people's perception in a class based society are brought out. As well as a sliver of understanding of poverty. Perhaps the best thing about the film though, is that if brings about nearly every emotion in the scope of human feelings. You have hate, anger, love, joy, sorrow, and so many more. As the epic story unfolds, your heart can not help but be swayed by the situation of the farmers, and yet you understand the feelings of honor that the noble Samurai hold. In the end though who can help but have some renewed sense of honor, justice, and duty in their own hearts towards all of humanity? Perhaps I'm speaking too much from the idealic side. The movie also had some very good fights. The action never felt gratuitous, something most films these days don't understand, and was well spaced throughout. I highly recommend this film to anyone. Tell your friends it's 3 hours long, tell them it's in black and white, tell them it's in Japanese with subtitles, and then tell them it's the best f'ing movie ever!",

734,29 December 2004,nongomery,10, Old but fresh... indeed.,"Akira Kurosawa's ""Shichinin no samurai"" is not a typical movie about fight in the old world of Japan. It shows contains many words of wisdom that are the main point of attraction. It's a delicate, over 3-hour-long story that takes you far, far away from nowadays - to the past. Magnificent screenplay, very glamorous problems solved ""without sword"" and outstanding ideas make this film unforgettable for the next months. It's a perfect difference between today's, Hollywood-like movies made by ""clicking the mouse buttons"" in unbelievable short time. It's really worth seeing and remembering. I've seen it once, but many scenes and situations described in this movie last till now. There's also no need to prepare for this movie. It's mechanism automatically wash our brains and let us forget about our measurable world.",
735,21 November 2017,user-831-730971,10, Kurosawa-style humanitarian spirit,"The Seven Samurai is the most important work in the history of Japanese cinema and was voted No. 1 in the history by the ""Newspaper of the Year"". Akira Kurosawa fighting scenes are very exciting and realistic pats, Gunma rushed, muddy battles even battle, in the fast splicing, long focal length newspaper and the use of slow motion mirror, all the images come together, exciting, not only change The tradition of Japanese martial arts films, but also for many martial arts films have a profound impact.",
736,11 May 2005,jorgejacobo,10," Excellent movie, I enjoy every time I watch it","About this movie, the Photography, the rhythm of the action, the performance of the actors, the final battle scenes, all these leads by Kurosawa are simply a Classic, if you want to learn about what a Excellent movie is, watch this, pay attention to every detail, you can get to know the people of the village, their fears, their desperation, and the expectations and fears about the Samurays, and how they transform themselves into warriors, it's like a little journey about their emotions and like all the classic movies, you can feel some empathy with them, about our fears and our personal challenges, I consider this movie one of the best 10 movies of all times, and my advise is to watch this movie, even tough some people may find it slow in certain moments, it's just not on the rhythm of Hollywood movies.",
737,29 March 2005,scion-1,10, Impressive,"A perfect movie. I didn't find anything I wouldn't like about this movie. Excellent directing from Kurosawa. Very good actors, especially Toshiro Mifune in the role of Kikuchiyo. Very good image and scenery. It is somehow emotional. The story might look simple but every character has a story of its own. The character that I liked the most was the one of Kikuchiyo, a farmer's son that wanted to be considered a samurai. A very complex character, and a very interesting acting from behalf of Toshiro Mifune. At the end when just 3 samurai remain from the initial seven, you don't feel any joy for the victory of the villagers. Worth seeing.",
738,23 July 2005,Th24FPS,10, My favourite movie of all time,"If asked what my favourite movie is, I always say I can't pick just one. If asked for a list of faves, I usually qualify it by saying my favourites change all the time based on my life at that moment, new faves or old ones that now seem much more relevant to me. ""Seven Samurai"" is simply one of the greatest films ever made and one I've always been impressed and fascinated by. Toshiro Mifune gets star billing, and deservedly so as he turns in a powerhouse performance, but Takashi Shimura's character is the focal point of the film. I recommend his star turn in Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" as well - a very different story. What makes ""Seven Samurai"" so special is how each character is so completely written and portrayed. Hundreds of others have written much more eloquently about this film so I won't get into details about why I loved it ... except to say that my other favourite character is the farmer, Yohei, a stock ""sad sack"" type who turns out to be so much more.",
739,23 May 2005,villamota,9, Multi-layered masterpiece,"I watched Ran, another Kurosawa film, a couple of years ago, and although I enjoyed it I found it far too long... It seems that Asian audiences used to be much more used to long flicks than the Western.",
740,26 September 2005,street_61,10, Greatest movie of all time !!!,"I don't think that there is a better movie then Seven Samurai,and i don't think it will ever be at better one made ! Every picture, every frame, every scene and composed music are perfectly made with unbelievable details. The movie is almost 3 hours and every minute you got your eyes stuck to the screen. Toshirô Mifune is AMAZING as the drunken and very poor ""samurai"" Kikuchiyo who give the movie the humor it perfectly need. A MUST SEEN MOVIE BEFORE YOU SEEN ANY OTHER MOVIE ! Cause when you have seen this movie you will start to notice how much i has effected other director as Sergio Leone, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Akira Kurosawa's greatest fan Martin Scorsese. This movie has been remade over and over again but will never be as the original. A movie with amazing screenplay which will live for ever, acting which never can be replaced and camera work which todays movie doesn't use more because of all the computer they have to help. SEE IT OR DON'T SE A MOVIE Again...",
741,17 June 2005,tsmith04,10," Akira Kurosawa's 'ballad of war'; a beautiful story with amazing acting performances, and an even better directorial effort.","Seven Samurai tells the story of seven unemployed, 16th century samurai who are hired by a poor village under attack from a group of bandits. An uncomplicated story indeed, Kurosawa directs his cast beautifully, mixing the individual abilities of his actors and the simplicity of his plot, and ends up with a work of artistic cinema considered by most critics to be among the greatest films ever made, and even by reviewers of the American film industry.",
742,1 February 2017,lucasforshee,10, The Best Movie of All Time.,"In my opinion this is the greatest movie to ever hit film. There is almost nothing wrong with this masterpiece. The pacing, editing, fight scenes, music, character development, and directing all come together to make one behemoth of a movie that will probably never be topped.I watched this movie when I was twelve and even then I was sucked into the rich story and vibrant characters. Every character is written into the story so well. I feel that every samurai has a point and a goal. This movie is also revolutionary in its use of slow motion. Because of this each battle scene seems vibrant and alive. That's why is my opinion Seven Samurai deserves a 10 out of 10 and a spot on the greatest movies of all time list.",

If you've seen more Kurosawa, you'll know that this is undoubtedly Kurosawa's best.And if you don't agree, then my guess is that your favourite movie is Plan 9 from outer space, and you should know what that means. This movie should always be in the top 10 films of all time, or, if not, at least in the top 30. As for those of you who haven't seen it, you should, it's well worth the three and a half hours that it takes up, as it will, almost undoubtedly, be in your memory for the rest of your life.",

The writing was phenomenal and the action was in a class by itself. I will always hold this movie up as my favorite movie of all time. The actors in the film were first rate. The ""wanna be"" samurai ( Toshiro Mifune ) was hilarious and underestimated. Aside from the expert swordsman, he caused the most damage to the enemy bandits. It is good to see that this film has been critically acclaimed to be a masterpiece and ranking in the Top 10 of the IMDb speaks volumes about the users of this website!",
