0,16 July 2011,TheLittleSongbird,9," Gives meaning to the phrase, save the best until last","I have enjoyed all the films and love the books, and after how much I loved Deathly Hallows Part 1 this entry, continuing from exactly where the previous film left off, had a lot to live up to. It is less faithful to the mammoth but very interesting and wonderful book than its predecessor. However I found this, apart from one or two disjointed parts where you could tell that details had been left out and the arrival in Hogsmede and the duel between Mrs Weasley and Bellatrix seemed a little rushed, had more flow, was better paced and had more coherent storytelling and less of admiring the scenery than the previous entries.",/
1,3 December 2018,nogodnomasters,10, LIGHTNING HAS STRUCK,"Perhaps this is the best place to review the series as well as the last installment. We have seen Daniel Radcliffe mature from a fairy bad actor to one that is fairly convincing, particularly in his standing up to Aberforth Dumbledore. Emma Watson has gone from awkward kid who wore her emotions on her sleeve to Maxim's top 100 Hottest women. The passing of Richard Harris was a major let down to the series as Michael Gambon couldn't really fill his shoes. The most interesting and complex character was that of Snape. Alan Rickman made the series with his portrayal. The casting of the quirky minor characters made the story most enjoyable, all the way down to Mrs. Fink. Rowling's use of classical mythology, astronomy and the occult made the series an incredible educational experience. One of my favorite characters was the under used Luna Lovegood. She was a breath of fresh air.",r
2,30 April 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, The series ends on a very strong note.,"The conclusion to the series hits some of the strongest emotional beats, mainly due to our long-standing connection with the characters, and provides some grand visual treats in the form of extended magical battles. While 'Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)' may be the biggest in scale and it is entertaining, it does feel lacking in depth - since some things are left oddly unexplained - and instead comes across as an extended third act for its duration. It actually plays out like one long climax, with little of the build-up required to further invest the audience, but at least it's well paced and doesn't hang about. A strong note on which to end a phenomenal series. 8/10",e

4,26 December 2015,hjpog,10, My childhood..,"At the start of J.K. Rowling, thank you for this wonderful series of books forever. I can tell you this current state of my childhood and my future. Sign up everywhere it has always been a part of Harry Potter's name. I'd say the most important series of my life. I owe my childhood such wonderful pass to the books and movies of this series. In this series, even though I know better than the series it has always been a special place for me in this series and it will always continue. This movie is definitely the best in the series. And the players is the most mature film. You feel throughout the film until the end of the final air and this is an amazing thing for fans like me. Book series as well as certainly never did. However, in each film it was pretty cool. And with incredible finale made this film. Harry certainly kept the best for last. Put all the music from the beginning to the end of the movie you are very successful and internal chills. You feel deeply cool is really going on. When the film ended up being a very big gap within you. Of course, you are a part of this world...",i

But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers.

10,19 July 2011,TourettesPersonal,9, Better Ending,"Endings are usually the problems of most movie series. They usually end up being mediocre & unsatisfying or they are made to cash in people. The great thing about Harry Potter movies, the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It's more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.",2
11,31 July 2011,DonFishies,8, A breathtaking finale to an amazing series,"Moments after I saw the very first trailer for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I was crawling with goosebumps and plagued with anxiety. After almost a decade, the franchise was coming to an end. I had already read the book, knew the plotting, and remembered the fates of all the characters, but the trailer left me in a near unfathomable state -- the end was coming, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.",4
12,10 February 2016,ironhorse_iv,8," Action packed, genuine heart and emotional drama made this movie, a very engrossing magical epic spectacle. It has everything, a finale should have.","While, personally, I'm not the biggest fan of the books in which these films was based on, I do have to say, this movie is a great movie to end the Harry Potter film series with. 10 points to Griffindor & director David Yates! Author J.K Rowling would be proud. The movie is very memorable. It's so unlike the other movies, which I found to be somewhat boring or below average. For me, personally, this movie, by far, is the best movie in the 2001 to 2011 film series, because how entertaining, it was. To all of the millions of Harry Potter fans around the world; most of them, agree with my statement. Unlike the other movies that are cut into two formulaic plot directions; one being the subplot is which tells the student life of Harry Potter at Hogwarts, while the other, being about the mystery that Harry Potter must uncovered that year. This most recent one has Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his gang of misfits, Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) & Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) going to various settings away from Hogwarts, in a last ditch attempt to their school from the oncoming invasion of Dark Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). The only way, they can stop this, is to find, all the missing objects call Horcruxes; that hold a part of a Voldermont's soul, protecting him or her from death. Seeing how epic in scope, this main plot is, it was no surprised that this 2007's novel with the same name, was adapted into two feature-length parts, with Part 1, being released in November 2010, and Part 2 was released in July 2011. While, some people might have complaints about why the final book being split, I'm not one of those. However, I'm starting to hate the recent trends of films, split into multiple parts; in which this movie brought back. Still, I do understand why the studios felt like they had to. After all, there is still way too exposition sub-stories from supporting characters from the book to fit, even in two films. Despite the film omitting a lot of things, the movie is stil mostly faithful to the source material, with only a few things, change that I didn't like. One of the biggest faults of the film is how both young and old Lily Evans (Ellie Darcey-Alden & Geraldine Somerville) doesn't have the same eye color as Harry Potters. The reason why this is a big deal, is because how much, everybody in the film series, point out how Harry Potter remind them of his mother, because of his eyes. It makes no sense. Another big jarring confusing plot-holes, is how wizards, can or cannot being able to use, other people's wands. In the film, one thing that really baffled me, is how Voldermont thinks that he can't use the elder wand, until he kills Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Yet, it's show, before-then, that he can indeed use that wand to do magic and other people's wand. The same with Harry Potter. It's weird, how the film makes it seem like they can't do magic without a wand, but yet, they show, them, just doing that with potions. Also, why does people still die in this universe, if Harry Potter has all of the three deadly hallows? Oh Snap! Didn't they establish that one of the wizards knows, how to heal himself with magic, if it's a bleeding wound? How is that character, even dead? Also, how can a living object become a horcrux? It doesn't make sense. In my opinion, don't bother, trying to understand the logic of all the wizard terms, because it will take you out of the fantasy movie, and give you a headache. The movie is full of unbelievable, deux ex machina that is very confusing, and not very logical. You just have to go with it. Nevertheless, I still don't get, why this movie is continuing its insulting black & white one-dimensional views of good Vs evil. A good example in this movie, is how everybody still treat Slytherin's house as an evil community of people, when the movie show that, there are mostly not!? Another thing, that bug me, is the fact, that the underage students weren't evacuated from Hogswarts. I guess, the school is trying to continue, its high death count record of being one of the most dangerous schools, ever. I swear, it always seems like the castle is always in danger. So, I wouldn't call the battle plot, anything new. It is very clichés and prediction. Despite that, the battle sequences are well done. Visual and special effects masterpiece. Lots of heart-breaking, yet fun moments. The music by composter John Williams really set the tone of the film, as always. The pacing for this film is also not a drag. Very well-pace. It's the shortest of all 9 films. The main cast was surprising better, too. Yes, they still, have that wooden delivery in some of their lines, but at least, it's more emotional driven than a normal read-through. Also, the over the top hammy lines by the season actors weren't so annoying this time, because how few lines, they were given. However, I didn't like the Epilogue ending as much as other people did. I can understand why a lot of people don't like it; in a way it feels a bit jumbled because so many characters of this new generation are introduced too quickly, and it's a bit much to take in. I personally am not too keen on the idea. It felt like sequel baiting. After all, it's clear, by Warner Bros that we haven't seen the last of this world completely, as spin-offs movies are indeed, coming soon. Overall: In the meantime, I urge you all to revisit the world of Harry Potter for yourself. Check out all 9 movies. It will be a trip, worth taking.",8

14,14 July 2011,cchip96,10," ""It all ends"" well","This movie could not do any better, it ended the Harry Potter series with a bang. It is a good balance from the first part of The Deathly Hallows. The first part was more of a drama, while part two was action packed left and right. This may be my favorite movie of the series, though all of them are equally amazing. I have read the books, and there are definitely major changes in the movie, but I find they fit perfectly well with the story, even if it isn't the original plot. Even for those who haven't read the books (why wouldn't you?!), it is equally enjoyable. This movie, along with the rest in the series, will be loved for years and years to come.",0

The cast is excellent, I love Emma Watson in this movie, she plays very well. In my opinion, this movie is the best adventure movie in the world because the plot is really awesome. Thank you JK Rowling and Steve Naves !

16,13 July 2011,ephoratus,10, Epic End,Even though I consider myself to be a huge HP fan I never thought I would actually give a movie from this series straight 10 out of 10. Just saw the movie today and the word epic is almost an understatement. This movie really lives up to the promises that have been made. Further more it is (in my opinion at least) the movie that stays most loyal to the book. I did miss some scenes from the book yet nothing relevant was left out. I don't want to give out any spoilers 'cause I don't want to ruin it for you but if you have read the book it will be very easy to follow and if not - well I think it still makes sense most of the time. I highly recommend you to watch it whether you're a fan or not. 10/10,4

Ever since the frothily juvenile but still undeniably good quality Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone first hit cinema screens in 2001, the Harry Potter saga has experienced countless crucial plot developments, more and more introductions of new characters and actors, several new directors and frequent changes of tone, all to give an astounding and vastly rewarding end result.

So, Harry Potter has been quite a journey. Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint have been awesome from start to finish. These are the best memories that I can keep on forever.

It's been a long, bumpy ride, with some films stronger than others - mainly the first few (in my own honest opinion). After a while, however, it all felt like the biggest cinematic tease ever. I mean, we've been told about Voldermort ever since the beginning, and we've known all along that the saga will end with this big, epic fight between good and evil... err, I mean Harry vs. Voldermort. However, that never came (except for a few teases here and there), and when the producers decided to postpone the inedible and split the last film into two, it became ever so frustrating.",e

To be honest apart from the first HP movie... every single one of the following movies has left out major plot points, characters and story lines.

37,29 July 2015,anaconda-40658,7, The Magic Is Done.,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (2011): Dir: David Yates / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman: The final film in this wonderfully enchanting series of films and this time the youth wizard Harry Potter must face and vanquish the evil Lord Voldemort for good. All three principal actors have grown much in the ten years of films. Daniel Radcliffe as Potter faces severe facts that could be fatal. In fact, a major plus here is how Potter is placed in a battle situation where he appears to have lost. Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint as Ron have been Potter's friends and companions through every film and thankfully the film ties off their romantic feelings without stooping to Twilight level. Then we have Ralph Finnes as Voldemort, one of the most evil presence in films. There is no remorse. He will destroy even his own in order to conquer. The secret involve the wand he possesses is another highlight revelation. Voldemort is historically the murderer of Harry's parents. Now they clash wands in what will appear as if Voldemort will dominate. When he utters a victorious laugh, he doesn't realize that he hasn't thought of everything. Alan Rickman has played Professor Snape in all of the films but here he is at his best, particularly when certain facts surface. David Yates returns as director after having made The Deathly Hallows, Part 1, as well as entries The Order of the Phoenix and The Half-Blood Prince. These films were always pointless entertainment but with such enchanting visuals, it concludes with as much magic as it begun. Score: 7 / 10",

52,9 July 2011,MovieGeekBlog,8, An emotional roller-coaster and the perfect end to constantly better series,"For many fans (and let me get this out now: I am one of them), this is  much more than just another film in the franchise: it's the it's the  end of an era, or simply the end of a journey which lasted for over 10  years (14 if you count the first book, back in 1997). There are no  precedents like this in movie history... There's a certain poignancy  that comes with it, because, as we all know, this is the last one EVER.  There will not be any other Harry Potter, no matter what. The film  clearly knows all that and consciously plays to it, tapping into our  deepest-self, reminding us about this journey we've taken and how we've  grown up with it.   The previously-unknown David Yates has slowly been able to find his own  voice with the latest 4 of the 8 instalments, by combining the sense of  magic the first 2 films had, the darker tone introduced to us by Afonso  Cuaron (with the third episode) but also that more grown-up approach to  the story, which has been brewing and growing with each chapter (and  book of course), but he also had the courage to actually hack to pieces  the overly-written source and actually make a better film (clearly  after book 3, no editor would dare to tell JK Rowling to cut anything  out). In this last ""Deathly Hallow"", he was able to basically stretch  the final battle over the course of the whole film, making it seem  greater and more epic than it's ever been in the book (In the end, box  office aside, it really did pay off to split the movie in two parts).  Considering the incredible amount of expectations which a film like  this can carry and, consequently, the almost impossible task of  bringing everything to a close, HP 7.2 does a really good job! Yes, of  course there will be some disappointed people, but I think the  disappointment will come from the fact that secretly each of us would  like this story to go on forever and, no matter what, you can never  please everyone. Considering what a massive commercial machine Warner  Bros is we must be so thankful for the way the franchise has been  handled. Producer David Heyman is obviously a man of heart, who cares  for his fans and set out to make the best films he could ever make,  playing on the strengths of its (let's be honest) not-so-perfect source  and in the end making it an even better product. In the end this film  must be judged with that same heart and not so much with the brain,  taking in consideration the series as well as this ending.  And you know what? My heart can't stop saying ""I just loved the  journey, thank you so much for it",

The action scenes in the movie were amazing and were better than the rest of the parts by a large margin. The story of the movie was less than the level of the previous part.

Harry's death at the hands of Voldemort and his coming to life again; the secret about Severus; the bravery of Longbottom; the demise of Fred; the sharpness of mind of Luna and many more to mention. All the knots tied from the first part are opened and what can the viewer want more. Direct encounter between Harry and Voldemort at the end and Harry throwing the Elder wand at the end gives a true meaning as Harry does not run for the quest of power. The lesson given to his son over election to Slytherin is also worth noting. The series ends but with the hope of coming back with another story. Good bye Hogwartz.,

The Harry Potter theme's pretty much non-existent at the beginning of this final film in the series (though we still float through the WB logo/film title). Unfortunately, we have to trudge through a recapping of where the previous film finished and some painfully slow exchanges with Olivander and a backstabby goblin. Yes, let's waste time on slow-talking/pointless moments of silence, movie (especially when you have the shortest runtime of the whole series)! Thankfully, things improve when Hermione assumes Bellatrix Lestrange's form so they can break into her vault. Wonderful Helena Bonham Carter doesn't get much to say/do in this film, but she makes up for it by perfectly capturing the facial expressions/demeanor of Hermione awkwardly pretending to be the complete opposite of herself. It's some nice humour in an otherwise pretty serious film.",

There will always be a debate about the place of J.K. Rowling's novels and their film adaptations in the wider pantheon of literary and film history.

Harry Potter changed all that, not to mention it was a breath of fresh air that kids wanted to read again. I did not read the books as Harry Potter wasn't the type of genre I would ever read but I did watch the movies to see what all the hype was about. I've always been very pleased with watching these movies, they're very satisfying, between the effects and the story and growing up with these actors, everything has just been great. The Deathly Hallows was split into two parts as it's a very long book and I'm sure they wanted to get in every detail for the fans. The last Harry Potter, while it was a good movie, it felt like it was a little boring at certain times for me. I haven't seen these films so close together and haven't read the books to know everything they are talking about so it was hard to keep up on certain parts.

Harry and his friends always reminded very much of themselves, because of two things - simplicity and good nature. Also, like any other person, we grow, mature, and it all happens under the influence of other factors. We observe and listen, exactly the same as the one when a little boy, in the course of years became a man. He had fears, and there were mysteries.

77,11 June 2012,jacklmauro,6, Close. Cigar Withheld.,"(Read PS first, if you please.) This final HP halfway makes it. Yes, we all love HP. Yes, all the films have been done with great style. Still, there was an onus on DH2, and Yates (and screenplay) miss here and there. - On the plus side, Radcliffe finally becomes a real actor. - On the plusser side, Rickman is BRILLIANT and he was robbed of a supporting Oscar. - Bad news (and, as with other quibbles, the movies should stand independently from the books): Bellatrix. She is equal to Vol in sheer evil, and she is grossly responsible for many gleeful murders and tortures. It's fine to have Molly kill her, but the moment was far, far too brief. This needed to be real revenge, to satisfy fans so hating of LeStrange. - The Kings Cross limbo. Egad. I know it's in the book, I know Albus needs to redeem himself to Harry, but the device was annoying and trite. - The Ravenclaw ghost scene was far too protracted. Yes, there had to be suspense about getting this horcrux, but it felt overdone. - Dumbledore's mysterious past and hunger for power: why allude to it strongly, then leave nothing answered? It was like the Bagstock presence in DH1. We movie watchers knew it was important, but the film did not clarify how. - Finally, the end. In LOTR, Jackson understood the audience needed to hear Frodo stop in wonderment, that the ring was gone. Same thing. When the 3 friends are kicking stones around, there had to be SOME expression relating that a vast doom that's haunted them all (and the world) was gone. Not too much, mind you, but some astonishment from Harry, certainly. - Epilogue. So, it was all about the kids? Generation Next? How dull. Better to have only referred to Harry's naming his son after Severus, which was right and touching. PS More bad: how, if you don't read the book, can you rationalize Harry being alive after the forest? All we know is The Vol throws the killing spell, not the kill-unintentional-horcrux spell. Also - far too much of gratuitous, aimless running around of students during and before the battle. Seriously. These kids all acted like they had no idea of what was going on, and were utterly defenseless. Oh, yes: the script itself. It's pretty weak. Maybe Neville's awful speech is how teens talk, but this needed to be stunning, not trite. PS Read the books. Egad. Makes Helena Ravenclaw's ghost worse here, and why on earth is she referring to a 'boy' who wanted to destroy the diadem in the past, when there was no need to destroy it before Riddle, the boy, got it to begin with? Lots of mistakes now really glaring, and the lamest part of the film is that it fails to explain Harry's sacrifice properly, as it echoed his mother's. WHY, oh, why, did they not want the tension of the final duel in the film, and that wonderful bit with Harry calling V by his real name, and schooling him? This humiliation of V then makes his quick death all right. I know a film must make changes, but to ignore the very best of the book is just plain criminal.",

Rowling's wizarding laws are completely decimated. Since when did Harry start 'sensing' horcruxes? Did Harry even possess this ability to 'sense' horcruxes to begin with? In that case, why didn't he realize that the diary in 'Chamber of Secrets' is a horcrux, and Slytherin's locket and Nagini in 'Deathly Hallows Part 1' are also horcruxes? In such as a situation, the trio would've been totally spared the trouble of wandering around like nomads (searching for the remaining horcruxes) like they did in Part 1.

And when harry goes to heaven or what ever that was...was just plain silly. The worst of all...Daniel Radcliffe was so wooden and boring to watch!

Then in 2001, Harry Potter hit the big screen and became one of cinema's most potent franchises then onward. Seven films later comes 'The Deathly Hallows: Part 2' and makes itself out to be the finest conclusion to a film series since Lord of the Rings, Return of the Jedi, and Toy Story 3.

With the books by J. K. Rowling it's different since they have no images. I must begin to say that I have not seen Part One therefore what I am saying here must be read having that in mind. This movie favours violent action and a lot of destruction to the detriment of the poetry of magics we have seen for instance in the H. P. AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN movie.

After that, so many flawless movie scenes (when astounding plot-twisting truths are revealed, when Harry and Dumbledore are in Limbo, when Neville gives his speech and kills the snake, when Harry finally kills Voldemort, when they're at King's Cross Station in the epilogue to wrap it all up perfectly with even the little detail of the chocolate frog as a call back to the first movie), just brilliant stuff!

6. The tender and emotional moments send legitimate shivers down your spine, specifically when Severus Snape acknowledges his love for Lily Potter (Geraldine Somerville), and when Harry Potter is being comforted by his deceased loved ones.

Basically, unless you are a hard core fan who has watched all the films several times and read the books, you will be confused time and again. This film is not shy about introducing a new character every five minutes. Do we need this many characters to tell a story about a magical kid with glasses?

It was nice to see some of the cast 20 years on since the first film. Oh boy those kids really did grow up. Although this review is suppose to be about Deathly Hallows part 2 there is just something that was said in the documentary that is actually about something in the film. There were a discussion with David Yates about the finale confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. David said that he chose to have that scene outside in the courtyard and not in the Great Hall as in the books. So, as the Potter fans already know there were no dialog in that scene, where as in the books Harry told Voldemort about the destroying of the horcruxes an also the Deathly Hallows. And that he, Harry, was now the wand's master, and that he is going to put the wand back in Dumbledore's grave, Which, although it is not written in the book, one can assume that he did. In contras with the book scene there is no such dialog in the movie so the secret and history of the elder wand remains a mystery and Harry's decision to break the wand in two and throw ii in the lake is actually more sensible. Because if no one knows about the wand history and power then there will be no temptation (just watch Ron's reaction and then you know why Harry did it) to own it and the deathly hallows will remain just a children's fairy tale.",

A lot of fighting that is brutal and graphic and also very sad when you see who dies. There is a scene of the death eater who is a werewolf gnawing at Luna Lovegoods dead corpse which gave me chills until Harry blasts him out the window which I applauded. Also the duels between Mcgonagall and Snape and Molly Weasley and Bellatrix that are scene stealer's. I loved how Mrs Weasley went ballistic on Bellatrix after she nearly kills Ginny. And tough old broad Maggie Smith shows you why you shouldn't mess with McGonagall - now whether or not Snape had no attention of fighting back, she really lays into him with some serious curses regardless. I wish though that they could have had a better ending , I blame that on Rowling who simply ended it without any wrap-up to the surviving characters -even though I didn't read any of the books i had to see how she ended it compared to the movies ending and its the same so i couldn't blame it all on the people who adapted the book to a movie although from what I've heard from the people who were devoted Potter fans who read the books that a lot of stuff was either cut out or redone differently and really ticked off a lot of the more devoted fans of the books. I can sympathize with that as I thought Lord of The Rings overblown inclusion of Arwen when she was barley mentioned in the books to be more so for the hormone ravaged young boys to gawk at than any real importance .And while the epilogue ending written by Rowling is meant to be heartfelt and sentimental , it was not really fitting in my opinion .skipping ahead 19 years for some reason ,why 19 who knows but it felt forced,with little dialog and no real chemistry between the characters,the makeup effects to make them look older were rather poor and that is why i give this movie a 9 and not a 10.",

Well, what did I know? There were undoubtedly some moments. There was humor in some occasions. Examples: A) The thing which qualified this movie as the best amongst yates works ( which is only the 4 HP movies :P) is the way he showed the prince's tale chapter. A lot of the credits has to be given to Alan Rickman. I have only seen him showing that much emotion in 'Rasputin'. But Yates also deserves some credits because he got the great out of his actor and portrayed it well. B) Then the moment when Mcgonagall (Maggie Smith) draws herself between harry and snape and start duelling. C) The moment when snape said 'You have got your mother eyes'.

Ralph Fiennes was the star, while he put down Lord Voldemort in a magnificent way.

171,3 August 2011,khono,4, J. K. Rowling is a masterful storyteller. The makers of this movie are not.,"The movie only passingly reflected the second half of the book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Corners were cut and a masterpiece of a book was turned into a misshapen and expensive failure. Oh, it may be a financial success, but because of what remains of the magic and greatness of the book.",

I preferred the Dumbledore in first two movies. The new one wasn't calm at all, as the one in the book is. So, that had always put me off from the movies.",
173,10 August 2020,bob-the-movie-man,9, Revisited on the big screen and as good as I remember it,"One of the (few) benefits of lockdown is to be able to revisit some classics on the big screen again, and that's what I did today for this last flick in the Harry Potter series.
Whereas Deathly Hallows Part 1 (aka ""3 go mad camping"") was low-key, this one hits pretty much all the right notes. It's dark, shocking at times (the dead girl after Greyback's had lunch!) and adds the right amounts of closure and mystery to the saga. There is also some nice humour, especially in the first half of the film.... Helena Bonham Carter playing Hermione playing Lestrange shows just what a fine actress she is.
My only gripe... after being the villainess of the piece for so many years, Bellatrix Lestrange gets dispatched a little too easily and quickly for my liking. But a worthy finale, and the ""final"" scene of the three stars on the bridge is genuinely moving (and should have been the end of the film in my book).",
174,13 July 2011,imkatelyf,10, Awesome.,"OHMYGOD. As a fan who has stuck with them from the first book. I loved it. I found it rather disappointing the way that Voldermorts died. I would have preferred to see that played out as it was in the books. However. That is the only thing i disliked. No film has captivated audiences so much for so long. Alan Rickmans acting was amazing. This movie was amazing no film has had me crying tears of sadness, tears of joy and tears of farewell all in the space of a few hours. I loved it. 13 years i waited to see Ron and Hermione kiss. 13 years well spent in my opinion. Short and sweet review as i was at a midnight showing it's 4am and i'm about to pass out.",
175,15 July 2011,bencurrey,10, it was amazing,"This movie was amazing, the experience was quite indescribable. Seeing the last two hours of the biggest part of my childhood was painful but the quality of the movie helped ease the pain. It was remarkably well done David Yates was certainly a great pick for this movie and he was light years ahead of Cuaron and Columbus. Although the movie changed some of the original parts, such as the Grey Lady knowing the location of the Diadem instead of Harry figuring it out or the fact that Percy didn't make his grand apology and that they didn't show Fred's death (there are a few more but I don't want to bore you). But I let all these things slide because in the grand picture everything came together seamlessly. The acting was much better, all of the actors matured and had greatly improved (Daniel Radcliffe especially, he's come a long way from the crying scene at the end of the fourth movie.) Best of all they did the book justice and did the scenes just as I had hoped, I thought the scene of Snape's memories was fantastic. All in all this movie was a spectacular end to a spectacular series and a great send off for the Harry Potter franchise.",
176,16 July 2011,olli1,4, Poor Adaptation,"I was looking forward to seeing the finale of the potter series, as the other films have been quite well presented. The latest 3 movies however have cutout vital bits of the story and the finale is just a joke. The film started off quite fast relative to the book, the whole breaking into Gringots scence was poorly adapted from the book. The final chapters of the book where 100 times better than the final parts of the film. When harry looks through Snape's memories it is way to brief, in the book a lot of emotion was shown as Snape saw the downfall to the relationship to himself and Harry potters mother. The battle between harry and Voldemort was truly disappointing as the director changed the engagement into battle between the two (and other main factors that I will not spoil for people reading this review). The positioning of Hagrid's whereabouts in the film pretty much show how poorly adapted the book was. They didn't even put in the line about Neville becoming a professor at the end.",

Everything is different from the book it's a terrible movie and it'S definitely not worth the 8/10 that people give. The first 7 movies were really decent like 7/10 not perfect but still really enjoyable but this one is just bad. It feel rushed and the ending is terrible because they changed everything. I don't get why people love this one so much its just not good at all. There so so much better movie that came out in 2011 and they don't have as much place as this one. I'm disappointed and I hope that eventually the rating will be corrected. I think this movie is worth a 5/10.,

I was tentative about the 3d but actually it worked brilliantly and made the pictures even crisper. This film is a great achievement, sometimes i have considered these films as sell- outs, only looking for doing well at the box office, but they have never failed to entertain and this one makes the characters and their motives much more interesting and deeper.

183,17 January 2021,darkice-200-411547,10, Maybe someone wants to read a different story,"When the first episode of this serie reached the big screen, I was 20 and couldn't care less. I was wondering the reason why so many people went literally crazy about Harry Potter in all those years. It took me about 20 years to find out the reason why. Now, I feel kinda ashamed about any prejudice that I brought.
I thought they were childish, they had nothing to teach, they were just movies made to fill in the cinemas without a real good content. I was wrong.
I watched all Harry Potter's movies during the last week. I'm 40 now but while watching those movies, I got captured by their atmosphere, sympathinzing with their characters, breathing the same air, dreaming of being there lending an hand... My mind went back in time when I was child and shared the same problem with some of characters. Those movies can teach a lot of things, important things: the value of the friendship, love, sacrifice, compassion... They are something I would make my sons watch.
The last episode leaves the audience with a sense of fulfillment, yet a sense of void. It's end. Period.
David Yates made an extraordinary job as director: the movie slows down when it has to but the action is very fast paced. Acting is impressive, as well. You can tell, movie after movie, how much mature the youngest ones became. The use of CGI is well balanced as it doesn't ruin the movie by being too much invasive. Soundtrack and photograph are simply perfect... The choice of filming is such beatyful places in Great Britain, once again, helps the sense of wonder.
I gave this movie and the whole serie 10 stars. I suggest you to watch it at least once in a lifetime because you might learn or find out something hidden within you. Believe a 40 years old child :)",
184,13 August 2011,mobbielim,3," The wand of destiny the death-stick, the awesome-st branch of doom","David Yates is one of those directors you either hate or love. If you have never read the book, there is a chance you might like/love his work. If you have read the book, there is a very high chance you want to grab hold of him and stuff the vomit-est vomit flavored Bertie Bott's beans in large amount of quantities in a particular orifice that ...well I leave it to your imagination. I have read the book and I hate his work, his sloppy story lines, his directing of the actors/actresses are hideously horrendous. If ever you want to make a comparison, watch Goblet of Fire and there is a distinct difference in the way the acting is done. This review is about HP7B- HP7B is better than the order of phoenix and very much better than the HBP. I like how he sped the entire 1st part up and yet made the storyline rather polished...then it slowed to crap. Like the HBP, if you have read the book & might have imagined Dumbledore's death much better than what Mr Yates had put out on screen; you know he clearly lacks imagination in delivering real emotion to cinema-goers. Such is the case when Harry finds out he is porky pig walking to a large oven filled with green green light that will bake him to crisp. I was surprised Daniel Radcliff acted pretty well at the end, the mud streaked face and perpetual soot covered all over look made him look very much like a potential murder victim. I also liked certain parts I thought clever like the shield around Hogwarts, very Final Fantasy like; oh an the elaboration of Ron n Hermione destroying the cup- thank you very much, I always thought JK rushed through that part rather carelessly. But again, the snog-ging o the snogging, must it be so well...necessary and fake. Then there was the ending, my point about Mr Yate's lack of ability to deliver proper emotion to ticket holders exact. Zap zap and zap zap and then Volde dies, then oh lets just waltz back to school. No yelling whooping cheering elation screams of joy clap hands stadiums filled with ecstasy. Just ... Nothing, the sickest baddest mother of naughty wizards without noses has finally been killed! zip nothing. It seemed like Mr. Yates ran out of budget, time, creativity towards the end and quickly sped through the script for the sake of making tons of muggle gold. Then the worst thing happened- the wand of destiny, the death-stick, the branch of doom, the amazingness fantastic-est bes-test most sought after stick of power! The ONE STICK TO RULE THEM ALL!! The one link to the DEATHLY HALLOWS was snapped like a brittle piece of instant noodle by a teenage boy. He wrangled that thing like an irritating wet fibrous piece of wood and tossed it away. All for the sake of not having to explain too much. Yes! Mr Yates, the reason readers really hate you is, you take short cuts just because of your inept ability to tell good stories in film- you did not want to explain too much how Harry could survive Voldy's zap, you were just too lazy to elaborate on the Deathly Hallows and did not trust us to understand wand lore. The result is, HP7B is very much a confusing movie for muggle readers and to those who have been magically blessed to read the book, it lacks imagination. 8.4 on IMDb!

In the beginning it follows the book well even if the pacing is kind of uneven. However, when the battle begins it starts to slowly stop using what was already well written in the book. The part that really got me upset was after Harry died. 1. He doesn't hide under the invisibility cloak and reappear later. 2. They drag out the snake killing, but thankfully Neville still kills it in the end. 3. Voldemort and Harry do not get the epic showdown in the Great Hall. Instead they fight everywhere and the Elder Wand explanation is dragged out. All in all the movie was very disappointing because of how much of the end they replaced.

I have never been more let down by the end of anything ever. The main focus or my rage is to be focused on the 30 sec light show between Harry and Voldemort. Harry destroys all the Whorecruxes and finally faces off against the ultimate evil but now that his little trinkets are broken he's actually a pretty weak wizard. In fact Harry kills him in 2 seconds and he just melts away. We've been waiting for this battle for 11 years and all that happens is Harry's beam is stronger. No screaming, no yelling, no fight for their lives. Just 2 beams meeting and Harry's is better. ",

Most recently, I rewatched just the last film and the experience was not as great, but still made an entertaining two hours. So let me recommend you to always watch at least ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" before going for the final installment. But whatever you do, you're still in for an exciting conclusion to the biggest film franchise of the 2000s and that comes from somebody who isn't even that big of a Potter fan. While the three young actors are okay as always, although I still struggle to see Radcliffe's Potter as the force he is supposed to be and Watson had more material and a better performance in previous work, it's nice to see some of the supporting players have great spectacular scenes as well before it all closes: Julie Walters on Helena Bonham Carter, Maggie Smith on Alan Rickman and Rickman himself in his final scene, who was probably my favorite performance here and I really loved how it all unfolded for Severus. The way we find out more about his background was done impressively, especially the flashbacks to his childhood and they really hit me on an emotional level. That certainly made up for the first half hour, where the film admittedly needs a while to really get going. The final scene 19 years later was really beautiful too, particularly the name reference (which made me ignore the fact that the trio doesn't really look 20 years older), and even if it probably guarantees there will be no more Potter films in the future, it was such a nice inclusion and there was something beautifully final about it.",

Everything is going on pretty fast from that spot! I usually don't like violence and gore, but there is some... Voldemort appears to be walking with feet covered in blood in Malfoy Manor. There are some really light and joyful moments in Hogwarts... Until Voldemort comes by. There are some epic scene including McGonagall looking really sad and cheerful at the same time. So there are still some horcruxes to find. The Cup of Hufflepuff will be destroyed by a basilisk fang and then there is a kiss we'we all been waiting for.",

Daniel Radcliffe's acting as Harry Potter is phenomenal, and I wouldn't watch this movie the same way if it weren't for him. Also, the amazing Alan Rickman portrays Severus Snape wonderfully as always. The way he shows Snape's emotions and internal conflicts is incredible!!

225,22 February 2012,hitmant92,6, The worst film adaptation of them all (a specific/subjective review for fans of the series but really does speak the truth),"I don't even think its close to how poorly this ended off the series especially in its false interpretation of the book's sequences. I truly did enjoy the film for the first half till about three quarters in. In the theater you are of course excited, its part 2, its the end of it all and the film starts and progressively keeps its frightened but epic tone that it needs to build it into the battle that is inevitably coming. Acting is good and all, good cinematography as usual with interesting cameras and the great makeup as usual. But that part of the film is NOT what ended the final chapter of the era that is Harry Potter. The fact there is no dialogue nor anyone watching during the final battle between the 2 of them (not to mention, no ""expelliarmus"" to finish Him off) is just not right at all. There is no dramatic ending or any kind of serious film making being done in the final 2- 4 scenes. Its just quick shots of the three/Neville fighting off Nagini and Voldemort for a minute and then its just harry and him in a quick draw with no talking between them despite that being probably the most exciting time in the books history!!!! This is just unbelievably frustrating and disappointing to me as I watch DH2 for the 2nd and 3rd times. After watching and during watching this film I don't feel as a viewer at all that Harry is finally about to end it, finally going to literally save the world from the worst person to ever supposedly live. No drama built up, NO ANYTHING. All we get is harry, ron, and hermoine standing next to each other as if it was any old adventure they've been on, after a simple 5 second battle between harry and a mortal version of Voldemort. In my opinion as a Harry fan, JUST AWFUL:",

243,25 April 2015,msloane1,10, Harry Potter's Emotional Finale.,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the best movie in the Harry Potter series. More than anything, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 packs an intense emotional punch. The scenes involving Snape's memories, Harry's experience with the Resserctuction Stone in the forest, and Harry ultimately going to face his ""death"" are all very poignant and moving. Deathly Hallows part 2 is mostly faithful to the book with one major exception and it's a good exception. The biggest difference is that in the book Harry returns the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's grave. In the movie Harry's snaps the Elder Wand in half and throws the pieces into the lake. I like the movie's way of handling the Elder Wand's fate much better than the book's because it makes it absolute 100% sure it really is the end of the line. Not much to talk about casting wise as we've seen them all before expect the children of the epilogue. Daniel and Emma remain fantastic in the lead roles as do Allan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes in key roles of Voldemort and Snape. And of course both the character of Luna Lovegood and her actress Evanna Lynch remain huge personal favorites of mine. The pacing is excellent. It's about a 2 hour movie and never has a slow moment. The music is different to match the emotional nature of the story and it fits well. And definitely loved hearing Leaving Hogwarts return at the end of the epilogue. That was awesome. The story is well presented. Great emotional finale. Faithfulness to the book: 8 out of 10. Pacing: 10 out of 10. Music: 10 out of 10. Casting/acting: 10 out of 10. Special effects/visuals: 10 out of 10.",

247,16 July 2011,nickrrrr,3, Ostentatious ending to a series that has lost its splendor of originality,"Story: Now this is where the film falls short the most, paramount importance is given to scenes where cheap romance occurs (retrieval of the basilisk teeth), which does nothing to enrich the plot, because it has no effect on the overall story, but the filmmaker does not seem o think it is important to explain Harry's ""loljks, I wasn't dead"", probably assuming that most people have read the book and the others will just say ""It was probably magic"", but this cannot be too much of a criticism because many of these weak storytelling mechanisms are taken directly from the books. As for the epilogue it seems cheap, gratuitous and completely out of tone with the rest of the film. It feels like it was left there to get a few cheap laughs and to leave the viewer with no uncertainty that Harry does live happily ever after. But most of these criticisms should probably go into a book review, because the source material is as weak as the film itself.",

252,16 July 2011,cathie454,6, Why do they do this?,"To be fair, it wasn't the worst HP film; that was Order of the Phoenix which was totally butchered. Most of this one was OK. All the changes in the movie from the book, up until Harry's final battle with Voldemort, were true to the spirit, plot and theme of the book. But Harry's final battle, and the fact that Hogwart's was destroyed (which did not happen in the book) were totally wrong, and there was no point to it. In the book, Voldermort and Harry face in one short battle, inside the front hall of Hogwarts, with all the combatants around them, watching. Neville has already killed the snake outside, and rallied the ""good guys"" by crying ""Dumbledore's Army"" and standing up to Voldemort. There was NO point to changing that, so of course they did. The duel between Mrs. Weasley and Bellatrix was way too short and without enough drama to make you care. I had expected the audience-- and myself-- to cheer at the end of that duel; no one did. The book's final battle between Harry and Voldermort was meant to be simple, one-on-one, in the place they both loved; it was meant to show that love was the strongest weapon, and that Voldemort was no more than Tom-Riddle-gone-bad. On dying he collapsed dead before them all, vanquished. It will never make sense to me why they changed such a basic part of the whole plot. The best I can say for this one is that it could have been much worse. My advice to anyone is to read these books before you see the movies, so you understand what you're missing.",
253,27 December 2014,lastdomino,5, Alan Rickman - Yes! The rest of movie - NO!,Alan Rickman did an awesome job with his portion of the story - his character was never separate from the book character. But the story was so rewritten as to miss many points that were important to the story. I understand how writers want to make the story their own from the original book writer but the value in the story comes from characters. Harry Potter was an introvert played by an extrovert actor. There were bits of the story from the book such as the final between Voldemort and Harry that went so much deeper to me in the book. Some of that value was lost in how the film portrayed the scene.,

Part 1 had me feeling like it was building a momentum for a great ending, however i still had the feeling while watching part 2. It was as if something great was yet to come, but sadly it didn't really come. Example: There weren't any great big fights (like the showdown between Voldemort and Dumbledore in Order Of The Phoenix) and the usage of spells was pretty much the same as in all the hp movies (with some exceptions). But the thing that bothers me the most was the ending, it felt as if the last couple of minutes were just something that had to be done, after the moment we all have bee waiting for(between Harry and Voldemort)it felt as if the rest was just a necessity of a couple of minutes. for example: there wasn't much talking between the characters/ no praising harry or anything. and there was hardly any respect for the fallen ""soldiers"". Generally speaking this doesn't mean that it lets u down, however one can not help but feel a little bit of disappointment after reading the book.

There are many moments in which supporting cast members take the foreground for a moment or two, but it is still Harry's story throughout the movie. I must mention the genius of Alan Rickman as Snape here, he was a defining point in this film and one of the reasons it was so special. Now, was it a perfect movie. No. The CG at points looked amateurish and some of the dialogue didn't fit well into the movie. Does it deter you from enjoying the experience. It shouldn't. These are just little things that annoy me. The whole movie looked amazing. The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy. This film was great, and the best finale a fan could have asked for. It's an incredibly memorable movie and one that i will never fail to enjoy.",

282,18 July 2011,jake-2-220009,3, harry has gone to pot,This movie was a big disappointment.Im going to make this short and sweet.The movie sucked.The only reason I gave it 6 stars is because of the battles.Without the intense scenes this movie deserves 4 stars.Lets start in the beginning.Its starts right off where the last movie left off.Not good at all.Even if you saw the movie a couple months ago you will not remember all of the last film.So the film producers were kind of stupid of not taking 5 minutes of the film and tell us what happen before.Like when they run on TV a two episode with the same plot and on the second episode in the beginning they say previously.Thats what they should of done.So I what I would do is see part 1 again.Then go see this film.What really kills me is that this movie is on the top 250 list.This movie is a disgrace to all movies.The only reason this movie got on the list so far is because everybody who has voted for it is a harry potter fan.So when you see on the list don't let it fool you.The only thing that is worth seeing in this movie is the attack on hogwarts castle.But remember Im not a hairy potter fan.I reviewing this movie as a critic.I don't care if its harry potter or not this movie was a disappointment to me but maybe not to harry potter fans.One other thing i feel sorry for the people who camped out 4 night just to see the midnight showing of this movie.,

284,25 May 2013,avs118,1, Book is 100 times better,The movie does not cover most of the important plots of other characters. The movie only only tells the story of harry Potter whereas the other character are far more interesting but the movie leaves their story out completely.It is not just this movie but the whole series was not made well. They have spent too much time trying to show harry's emotions instead of showing more about the magical world. Primarily the movie is shot for kids and not for mature adults unlike the books. The special effects are good but was highly disappointed by the story. The movie might be worth watching for the people who haven't read the book but i would recommend everyone to read the books instead of seeing this movie.,
285,16 July 2011,mccormick632,6," It's finally over, and I couldn't be happier!","Up until this point the Harry Potter franchise has been a series of mediocre film after mediocre film, with a vast majority of them being just plain awful. Part I was one of the worst films I ever saw in my life, it was dull, long, and incredibly stupid. I could not have been less excited about this film even if it had been hailed as the best movie of all time. Yet, nevertheless, I dished out the $18.50 for Imax and 3D to see this film with some friends. Does this film transcend the c*** of the other films?

288,16 July 2011,celebintown,5, Not quite the end I imagined,"The general idea is that you don't fix what ain't broken. Unfortunately that's what they seem to be trying here anyway. I was happy that the finale was split into two, seeing as 'Half Blood Prince' was such a disaster. But they did it unevenly and the bulk went into part one. So this part felt rather sparse and lackluster story wise. Still, what actually disappointed me was how they skipped and shuffled bits around trying to make it more impressive and in the process butchered everything I loved about 'Deathly Hallows'. The final battle for example. There were things I was really looking forward to watching on screen - small but significant scenes, characters rising up to the occasion, explanations, finally. Maybe because it's the finale, expectations are obviously sky high and on top of that I've always loved the books very much. But I get the feeling the people who made this movie don't really have much love for this universe. The acting is average, special effects alright, but nothing is impressive. It's not bad, but not very good either. At least not the end I was hoping for.",

The acting and dialogue were still a bit stiff and my comments previously on how magical combat it handled still stands but there is much more going on this time. The battle of Hogwarts was surprisingly rather well handled. Despite my issues with the combat, there were some little bits of creativity like a quick time freeze and large fiery beasts. Although basic, the terracotta army was pretty cool to see also. Many character deaths made the stakes and consequences feel more real adding some emotional depth that wasn't there for me in part 1 (other than Dobby). The action was much more competently filmed but there were quite a few moments where it felt like the extras were running or standing around not doing anything. More of a nitpick though. ",

294,4 April 2014,saad-azam4-719-547239,7, Great,"Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows part 2, directed by David Yates is a thriller and an adventure film, based on J.K.Rowlings novel. It stars the same actors as all the others: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint; Emma Watson the three wizards on the hunt for the horcruxes which are the magical items that must be searched and destroyed as they are the keys to Voldermorts existence, it is vital to destroy them before the dark lord finds them. The action begins with the fight between good and evil, who will win? This is the last of the eight and is surely the one to sum it up with its gripping action and strong plot which gives you different ideas to how it may end. With different directors each time, this director made an impression which will last, besides first impressions always last. Compared to part 1 of Deathly Hallows which did more talking rather than fighting, but this one is the completely opposite. Harry confronting his enemy and with sacrifices, loyalty and betrayal it all spells out disaster. This is how Rowling puts the pieces together to make the Harry Potter a book for everyone, who knew it, would even get adults crying. Also what I think was great about this film was the clever music, which was very eerie and simple which gave every scene its clutch. We also get to see some of the new enemies such as the dragons, voldermorts gang as well as Snape's motives, who is what good or bad? As the film goes on we get an understanding of why Snape took the actions he did, this is what I like about Rowling how she turned a misunderstood character into a hero. Voldermort is another one which will catch you out as the fact that he is similar to Harry. When Harry is knocked out by Voldermort and meets Dumbledore who explains without Harry's existence there would be no Voldermort due to the fact that harry is the last horcruxe. This was again very clever of Rowling how she explains why harry can sense voldermorts feelings and why he can speak snake language which all begins to make sense. I personally felt that Snapes scene where Harry sees his past was the most emotional and most felt part, as you see a part of Snape which we didn't see before, how he was madly in love with Harry's mother, bullied by Harry's father and what he did to sacrifice his life for Harry. When Harry has to fight Voldermort, the first thing that came to my mind was that Harry might die because you don't know what is going to happen next. The director has been able to build tension throughout the film. He has been able to draw the attention of the audience into the most important scenes throughout the film. Another thing which the director did that court my attention was his creativity with the special effects and what summed it all up was putting it up in 3D which brought the whole thing to life. It made fans of Harry Potter such as I feel surrounded in the magical world of wizardry, which is a great experience to have if you love Harry Potter like I do. What I think may have been a spoiler was the fact that not everything written in the book was mentioned in the film and this is a real shame. Also the fact that everyone else in Gryffindor is allowed to fight except from slithering who were locked in the dungeons and were not allowed to fight and there wasn't enough interaction with the characters as when Fred (cousin to Ron) dies there isn't any sympathy not even from Harry. Other than these negative the rest of the film was great and was rated 8 out of 10 for everything also with 408 critics which gave more ratings, no wonder this was the best film of 2011. But a positive would be that the directors kept the same actors for all 8 films as we have seen them grow from young children into adults. Also the battle at Hogwarts was very heart grabbing as we saw a lot of character's who gave themselves up especially Neville who did all he can do protect harry which I thought was perfected as this was the exact same thing that was written in the book about him. The ending was where we all got the message that this is it, there isn't any more of the Harry Potter adventures when harry and his wife (Ron's sister) and Ron with Herminie sending their children off to Hogwarts, we sense that this is it for Mr Potter. This is a great way to say farewell to the Harry Potter adventures along with this film this one made it worthwhile as it started and ended with action what is more we got a better understanding of Harry Potter and all the characters. If I were to rate this film it would be ten out of ten so if you are thinking of watching it then you should.",
295,14 July 2011,alexbrisan32,10," All in all a pretty good movie, but....","As i already said in my summary, the movie was pretty good, and i also think that there were some elements which may have surprised some of the viewers, but i'll talk about that later. I think i have only one bad point for this movie, but i'm not sure if it was the movie or the cinema... I watched the movie in ""3D"", but the only things that were 3d were the ads BEFORE the movie, and some very short scenes in the movie. I didn't like that at all. To be quite frankly, though i secretly hoped that Harry would survive, i was quite expecting him to die. I don't know, but they said that some ""amazing deaths"" would appear, but i didn't find it amazing that Freddie(i think), Snape, Bellatrix, or Voldemort all died. However, Part1 made you expect that Severus was the bad one, but as i understood he was the good one. I think that the directors were a bit too cruel when they told harry that Dumbledore was a bit of a bad guy. There also are a couple of thing which i really liked about this movie: 1. I think that the graphics were amazing, respect for those who did the image editing. 2. Another interesting part is that in my opinion the producers made up the question whether or not James Potter is Harrys father, because at some point there are mentioned some similarities between Snape and Harry. 3. I was also expecting that if Harry would Survive, he would become the next Headmaster of Hogwarts, but instead he seems o haven a pretty normal Muggle life(come on?!). In my opinion, the most funny part of the entire movie is at the end, where Harry with Ginny and Ron with Hermione bring their children to Hogwarts. The funny thing is that Harry's Son is Called Albus Severus Potter, which in my opinion is interesting, because if it were after the name, he would be the greatest magicians of all time.",
296,1 August 2011,jboothmillard,8, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"This was the finale in the highly popular film series, based on the equally popular series of books by J.K. Rowling, and when I saw that it was rated the full five out of five stars, and available in 3D, there was no way I would miss it. Basically the story continues from where Part 1 left off, after Dobby the house elf was killed, and Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) found the powerful Elder Wand in the grave of Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon). Friends Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are still searching for the hidden Horcruxes, the secret to Voldermort's immortality, and with the help of goblin Griphook (Warwick Davis) they break into the vault of Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) to find one. After escaping the goblin bank with the help of a white dragon, we see the Dark Lord and the other villains have taken over Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) has become the new headmaster. After meeting Dumbledore's brother Aberforth (Ciarán Hinds) the friends are taken by Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) through a secret passageway to Hogwarts, and they are reunited with old friends in hiding. Snape is informed of Harry's return, but he is confronted, leaving way for Professor Minerva McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) to start the revolution with many of the remaining teachers against the dark forces. Harry meanwhile is told by Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) to go and see the ghost for Helena Ravenclaw (Kelly Macdonald) to find one of the last Horcruxes, and finds out it is hidden in the Room of Requirement. Ron and Hermoine meanwhile destroy the Horcrux from Lestrange's vault with the fang of the Basilisk skeleton in the Chamber of Secrets, and they also share their first kiss. While the teachers and some students fight against the dark forces, Harry goes to the Room of Requirement and finds the hidden Horcrux, and although confronted and nearly killed by old enemy Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), the three friends save his life. After destroying this Horcrux and weakening Voldermort more, Harry looks into the Dark Lord's mind and sees that the final Horcrux is the snake Nagini, and they witness him kill Snape with the Elder Wand. Before dying however Snape gave Harry some tears, and in the Pensieve these are used to look into the past, where he sees Snape was not only in love with his mother Lily Potter (Geraldine Somerville), but that he was also there on the night when she and James Potter (Adrian Rawlins). But the bigger twist than that is that the reason Voldermort did not kill him on that night was because he is the final Horcrux he unintentionally created, so according to Dumbledore he is destined to die. Harry decides to follow this path by going into the Forbidden Forest and confronting the Dark Lord himself, allowing him to cast the Killing Curse, therefore sending him to a white limbo, where he is given wise words by Dumbledore that Voldermort has in fact killed the dark part within him. After Harry returns to his body we see Voldermort overjoyed that he has ""killed"" him, and asking all to obey him now, however Harry springs to life and runs away, while everyone else fights. While the duelling between the hero and villain goes on, Neville decapitates the snake Nagini with the Sword of Godric Gryffindor, therefore all the Horcruxes are destroyed, leaving Voldermort mortal, and he combusts into ash and is blown away. The final scenes see Harry reject the powers of the Elder Wand despite being the rightful owner, and sixteen years later we see older Ron and Hermoine, and Harry and Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) on Platform 9 3/4 saying goodbye to their own children as they head for Hogwarts for their first term. Also starring John Hurt as Ollivander, Domhnall Gleeson as Bill Weasley, Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Warwick Davis as Professor Filius Flitwick, Helen McCrory as Narcissa Malfoy, Julie Walters as Molly Weasley, Katie Leung as Cho Chang, Jim Broadbent as Professor Horace Slughorn, Miriam Margolyes as Professor Pomona Sprout, Gemma Jones as Madam Pomfrey, David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, David Bradley as Argus Filch, Nick Moran as Scabior, Emma Thompson as Professor Sybil Trelawney, Devon Murray as Seamus Finnigan, James Phelps as Fred Weasley, Oliver Phelps as George Weasley, Chris Rankin as Percy Weasley, Leslie Phillips as The Sorting Hat and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. It is going to feel odd for a year or two not to expect another Harry Potter film, all the actors are of course fantastic in their roles, many parts of the story, especially the one or two big twists work really well, and the amazing special effects serve the final film fantastically, a highly watchable fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction, Best Makeup and Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Make Up & Hair, Best Production Design and Best Sound, and it won the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?). Very good!",

The basic plot is that Harry,Ron and Hermione have to find the remaining horcruxes, but the final battle is coming near.When Voldemort dies at the end of the film no one cares which is really stupid, considering that Voldemort is the reason that all those people are dead. Also the bond between Harry and Tom Riddle is not explained as well as it is in the book.

299,14 July 2011,Alise_shenle,6, Exciting but Hilarious in a bad way,"So the effects were spectacular--come on, we've all fantasized about how Hogwarts would be torn apart, haha, and how the stone soldiers will fight giants. But it was really funny in an unintended way. 1. Moldy Voldy seems to be a weak doddering old man, with no menacing air at all. 2. Snape makes me want to fall asleep as he talks to s-l-o-w-l-y. But he looked quite handsome when he's in love with Lily Potter, and as a kid. Hehe once in his lifetime probably. 3. Dumbledore looked evil 4. Harry suddenly became really pro at dueling. 5. Ron is a idiot who just states the really obvious 6. Hermione becomes dumber after just one kiss from Ron. 7. Neville suddenly become a hero that always carry his sword around. 8. Prof McGonagall rocks. The funny parts: When Voldy kill Harry, he purposely drag out the ""AVAHDAR KEDAVRA"" which he thinks sounds epic but which really sounds hilarious. Bad dialogue. Voldy: ""the boy who lived..."" no longer? Harry: ""You-know-who"" sucked? Yeah, he sucked. Funny images including baby Harry with the weird lightning scar. When Voldy laughed and kept on repeating Harry Potter's death. seriously the whole cinema laughed. When the death eaters storm into Hogwarts with Harry and giants roll off the cliff--OMG those dumb giants were farming and then they're too fat and roll off, HAHA. When Neville woke up admist the fighting and he looked dazed, really funny. The giant protective sphere being attacked by ""fireworks""--looked like sperms attacking an egg lol. I guess some people will cry because they're sentimental, but to me and my friends, it is just hilariously funny. I love Harry Potter, but to me this seems more like a TV final episode than a stand alone movie.",
300,8 October 2018,alyonkyast,10," «The boy, who has survived»","It is the most famous screen adaptation in the history of cinema. Even people, who have not ever seen it, know this story about the wizard which came to our world to overcome the evil. There were seven books and eight films, because the last part was shared into two flicks due to new Hollywood standard. If you have not guessed yet, we are talking about the novel by Joan Rowling. The last film about Harry Potter was realized on the 7th of July in 2011. And it was the highest-grossing film of this year and the tenth-highest-grossing film of the all times. 
What is the secret of success of the ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2""? To solve this mystery let's focus on the key factors of a movie success such as: plot and story, their relevance to the audience, star power, director, special effects, budget, release date and critics' reviews. All of these constituents are here. 
It is obviously that the plot resonates with the dreams and beliefs of target audience. Harry finally met with his enemy and the greatest battle is going to start, but surprisingly Voldemort become stronger than Harry has excepted. What way the inseparable trinity, Harry, Ron and Hermione will found to protect their school and their world? It seems to sound impossible but Harry decides to sacrifice his life to bring the death to Voldemort. The audience froze in anticipation, everyone would like Harry to live. Despite all fans of Harry Potter know the end of the book they are truly worrying during the film. 
It is going without saying that the most part of actors, who has been shooting for more than ten years at the all previous films, has a large and enthusiastic fan base. Not only main characters which were played by Denial Radcliff, Rupert Green and Emma Watson but actors of supporting roles too, like Allen Rickman or Helena Bonham Carter - of course, they were gained recognition from the audience. 
A well-known director is one more important factor. David Yates shot three movies about Harry Potter before the last one, but none of these parts has such huge box-office. They all made a great profit over 900 thousand dollars but the ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" has raised 1,3 billion dollars. David Yates has brought whole his experience into his last film, he knew how to make the perfect picture.
Since the 2000s ""Harry Potter"" has changed significantly. The last part was not a fairy tale like the first part, it was amazing, mysterious and scaring world. And director needed the computer-generated imagery to integrate magic world into a real life and make film more gripping. Needless to say, that the ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" was recognized by the Academy Award for the best visual effects and was awarded by BAFTA at this nomination also. Thanks to the soundtracks by gorgeous Alexandre Desplat the film won the Annual Grammy's Award. 
""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" had a budget of 250 million dollars and was co-financed by Warner Broth. Pictures and Heyday films which were very generous for whole necessary things. 
Another reason of the film's acceptance is a good labeled from the critics. Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four and said, ""The finale conjures up enough awe and solemnity to serve as an appropriate finale and a dramatic contrast to the lighthearted (relative) innocence of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone all those magical years ago.""
At last, the release date. It was the middle of the summer, when cinemas became full of Harry Potter's fans. Not all previous parts were turned out in summer, lots of them were screened in autumn or in winter, when many of viewers has not opportunities to visit cinema palaces.
To sum it up, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" is an example of a commercially successful movie where various factors come into play to bring millions of viewers and provide the renown from the world cinema to all members of the film's production unit.",

316,5 September 2015,filipemanuelneto,9, The expected end.,"This film is the adaptation of the second half of the seventh and final book in the Harry Potter's saga, written by J.K. Rowling and directed by David Yates. This film is the end of a franchise that lasted more than seven years and earned billions. Yates excellently fulfilled its role but seems to have been a bit dazzled by the special effects. Certainly they have done a great service to the film, but it seems that, in the midst of so many effects and phenomenal camera angles, the script was a bit put away, eventually detaches from reporting the original book. One of the most surprising and unfortunate facts of this film is the radical change in the appearance of some parts of the castle, as its main entrance (which originally wasn't near the Great Hall) and the appearance of the stairs. Throughout the saga and all the books, the castle stairs had the same appearance and the ability to change position, which sometimes took the students to places where they wouldn't (or couldn't) go but, in this film, those so-known stairs gave way to some others, completely different, wider and imposing but that have nothing to do with descriptions of the castle in the books.",
317,21 July 2011,lesleyharris30,9," A Stunning Finale, Does not Disappoint,","Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a fantastic film with a really well developed storyline and a stunning cast. Fans will not be disappointed, it closes out the franchise perfectly, all the loose ends are tied up, it is clear J.K. Rowling wrote the perfect ending in her book that had all fans very pleased, and David Yates brings it to life perfectly, making it the darkest, most intense of the series. The only issue I felt it had is that some characters are pushed to the side, ones that were significant in previous movies, whose character arch is unfulfilling, such as Minerva, Horace, Sybil and, in particular, Hagrid, one of Harry's closest friends whose screen time was very limited, I understand that they had a lot to go through, but it left me disappointed. I have said before that the cast were always maturing and growing as this series continues, and this is no exception, their performances here are very effective, the young cast members are pure professionals now, living and breathing the lives of their respective roles. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint all shine, as does the ever terrifying Ralph Fiennes, the thrilling Alan Rickman and the charming Michael Gambon, the amount of iconic, unforgetful performances here are spectacular. An action packed, intense and well acted finale, I would recommend Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 to anyone looking for a good adventure or fantasy film. ",

When the special effects seem fake at times, when there is a scene later in the movie that appears to be a memory that is photographically superior to most of the rest of the movie in terms of sharp clarity, when the character development and evolution seems to have stalled, when characters die off screen losing the emotive intensity, when the high point of the movie, perhaps the one that really stands out comes towards the end of the movie where Harry Potter must face himself doesn't really flesh out completely and latter scenes seem to also give away the surprise, when the pieces and mystery seem patched together, it appears this last Harry Potter has grown up into adolescence when magic becomes only dreams and fairy tales, stuff that only young children believe in.

That's right, the ending has finally come to the movie series that started ten years before this movie, the movie adaptation of the classic Harry Potter book series. Like Roger Ebert wrote in his review of this film, we have a big class reunion here, and a great, epic, dark, dramatic one, too. I remember when I first saw the (comparatively) light and innocent Sorcerer's Stone. I was nine years old at the time. Here I am, eighteen, and writing the review for the last film, which I saw on Wednesday. I watched over the years as the movies got progressively deeper, more emotional, more mature, and darker, to the level of darkness at which this film is (tone-wise, and light-wise, in certain scenes). The movie picks up where the last movie left off, and covers the last third of the seventh book. This movie continues with the excellent balance of action, suspense, mystery, character and story development, tone, emotion, etc., and excellent special effects, only it has even more action.",

The success of J.K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" series theatrically has been unprecedented in both box-office receipts and critical success. Perhaps Warner Bros. and producer David Heyman are to thank for their careful supervision, or original director Chris Columbus for helping to envision a foundation for future success and casting three kids who proved as right for their roles at age 10 as they do at 20. Maybe it's long-time ""Potter"" scribe Steve Kloves for finding a way to give both fans and studio heads exactly what they were looking for.

331,28 January 2022,GusherPop,10, A brilliant and the movie wrote the ending better than the book,"After seven earlier films reaching back a decade, the Harry Potter saga comes to a solid and satisfying conclusion in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2."" The finale conjures up enough awe and solemnity to serve as an appropriate finale and a dramatic contrast to the lighthearted (relative) innocence of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" all those magical years ago. Harry, Hermione and Ron are grown up now, and Harry has even grown the facial stubble required of all epic heroes. The time has come for him to face Lord Voldemort in their final showdown, and their conflict is staged in a series of special effects sequences containing power and conviction. I am still not sure what the bolts discharged by magic wands actually consist of, but never mind. They look wicked and lethal. What I can observe is that this final film is a reunion of sorts for a great many characters we've come to know over the years. So many distinguished British actors have played roles in the Potter films that those who haven't may be fitfully resentful. Here we see once again characters whose names were once new and now resonate with associations: Bellatrix Lestrange, Rubeus Hagrid, Professor Dumbledore, Ollivander, Lucius Malfoy, Sirius Black, Severus Snape, Remus Lupin and even Prof. Minerva McGonagall, who is called upon to summon her powers and shield Hogwarts School from the powers of Voldemort. That said, it's apparent again in this film that the three leads are upstaged by the supporting characters. Their role is to be plucky, clean-cut and stalwart. They sneak around and observe things. They eavesdrop. They speculate. They are lectured to. They endure a little low-key puberty. Harry struggles to master his magic. Meanwhile, such British legends as Maggie Smith, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes steal scenes just by standing there. What chance does Harry or anybody have against Voldemort's smashed face with its nostril slits? Late in the film, leaving nothing to chance, Voldemort even appears as his own fetus, looking like it's been simmered in red sauce. This entire movie is dark, gloomy and filled with shadows.",

During the movie I noticed that quite often you see a sort of Schiller like theater setting in layers appearing on the screen. First layer is sharp, other layers are often not sharp. In photography terms we call this the depth of field. I actually haven't given 3D a lot of thought since it came available, but seeing The Deathly Hallows I realized that when you watch a 3d movie, you want a high level of dept of field. In that case most layers will be sharp giving you a good 3D experience of the movie like looking through a window. Lot's of detail become visible. As the Deathly Hallows don't often use a high DOF, I can't recommend the 3D version as an extra feature to the movie experience, often it's rather annoying to watch this version compared to the 2D movie.",
348,16 October 2012,miriamseshadri,6, Not true to the book,"I think as a movie it was OK, definitely not awful. It did follow the general theme. Other reviewers have done a good job pointing out where they thought the movie was disappointing and I concur with most of those. However, the point which stands out most to me and where I really felt that Yates and his scriptwriters had not read the book properly was when Harry entered the Room of Requirement and found Ravenclaw's diadem. The book quite pointedly says that it was not one of the many glittering tiaras that Harry found. In fact, he was despairing of finding it but then he had a flashback to the fourth book where there was a mannequin with a dusty old crown on it's head. There was no reason to make it a glittering one in a box, it would not have taken more time to stick to the story with this particular scene. The movie really did feel that Yates just wanted to get it out of the way and do it as cheaply as possible ( since there would be no more prospects of making mints of money off future movies). It's a shame and I feel that if they had put Cuaron in as director and made it a 3 hour film like some of the earlier ones, they could have made one of the greatest finale movies ever which would have made them more money over the long term ( instead of having to sell it for $10 which is the price I bought it at).

350,9 September 2016,mike48128,10, A masterpiece of a finale with a great finish and epilogue,"Before all this, I was a great Star Wars fan, but there is so much more ""depth"" to this entire series of books and movies. There are many great plot synopsis reviews here and on the web, so I will stick to just a few highlights and comments. Vodemort, having desecrated Dumbledore's tomb, steals the most powerful ""Elder"" wand, but it later turns out that he is not it's true owner, as Draco killed Dumbledore and Harry defeated him. Dumbledore was stricken with a fatal spell anyway, so it is more of a mercy-killing than a murder, but that's yet another story. There is a touching scene where Harry gets to meet both of his dead parents through a Resurrection Stone hidden inside of the ""Snitch"". Voldemort eventually discovers that the Elder Wand does not cooperate and won't obey all his commands. He kills Harry Potter, as Harry is the unwilling recipient of a part of Voldemorts' soul. He dies, but meets Dumbledore at a ""half-way-station"" on the way to Heaven. He is given the choice to return to the living or move on to the next level of existence. He chooses life. There is a huge battle scene. Both Hogsmeade and Hogwarts are destroyed and many Death Eaters and good Wizards are killed in this battle. As Hagrid carries Harry (who appears dead) he springs back to life and has a ""Wizards' Battle to the Death"" with Voldemort, as the last Parsal-Snake is killed with the Magic Sword of Griffindore. Harry wisely destroys the Elder Wand by breaking it in half, and throws it into the water, as not even a Wizard should have that much power or live forever. In the epilogue, Harry & Ginny and Ron & Hermione send their children to Hogwarts 19 years later. A most satisfying ending and Draco sends his white-haired son to Hogwarts as well! A long but very fast-moving action film that is totally spell-binding!",

When they sneak back into Hogwarts, they try to find the remaining Horcruxes but Hogwarts is soon under attack by Voldemort and his Death Eaters. In the end, only one can live.

362,1 April 2016,MuviFan73,9, Final installment: dark and extremely successful in catching nerves.,"There are so many movies we like, but time is always the main constraint. It matters when we have seen the movie. Harry Potter is a series that we have grown with. I remember, I never read those books. I remember how I have waited about an entire year till summer, when the movies were to be first premiered on TV channels in India. Sometimes 2 sometimes 3 and finally 4 were amongst the movies that I got to watch at the weekends.",
363,18 April 2020,Eriksen2020,10, Love it,I'm going to leave the same review at every Harry Potter film. The Harry Potter film series is seriously the best! I can watch it over and over again and I will never get tired of it. I love this whole magic world and I love how perfectly connected the series are. I was a huge fan when I was a child and I'm surely still are - 10/10!!,

365,13 July 2011,sinbadadventure1,10, This movie is the best out of 8 movies in this series,"I've just watched this movie in the cinema. So, my mark for it will be 10 of 10. But honestly, I don't really like the way they change the final duel between Harry and Voldemort as well as the way Harry won. It's not logic at all comparing to the book's events. The creativity in the Hogwarts battle is good, but still it cannot provide the super surprising, astonishing and logical explanations for everything has happened from the start to the last moments. 3D effects are good, but not as good as in Avatar. Anyway, it's still the best out of 8 movies in this series. I'm gonna miss this wizard world so much for many years. J. K. Rowling is really the BEST!",
366,17 July 2011,KnightsofNi11,8, An incredibly fitting end to a ten year endeavor,"Well this is it. This is the film that ends the legacy that began an entire decade ago. 2001 saw Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, and eight films later we are ending it all with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. This is an incredibly impressive feat to make an entire book series into a film series with literally only one recast. I refer of course to Michael Gambon's recast as Albus Dumbledore, but that is only because his predecessor, Richard Harris, passed away. The series has seen its highs with works of art like Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban which proved that this was no longer a small time family series, to the terribly unconvincing Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire which showed us how awkward the series could be. But now we've arrived at the very last film which provides us with an explosively grand ending to a series that has been mystifying our minds for ten fun filled years.",

You really attach yourselves to these characters. You don't want anything to happen and if something did you feel it in your heart. The twist at the end is fantastic but extremely heartbreaking. I couldn't believe it and felt so sad. The music is preparing you for what could happen making you nervous. I hope more people see this over the next couple of years because wow, it's amazing!",

But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!",
372,14 July 2011,timijan-tuparov,10, The Most Epic Conclusion Ever,"I must admit, I didn't like David Yates when he first entered the Harry Potter franchise, but this was phenomenal. I watched it and I loved it so much! It wasn't like the book, but it was better on screen that way. Very exciting, very touching (especially if you're a hardcore fan, like me) and very vivid vision of the last chapters of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"". I cried several times, I admit it, and I would never be ashamed to say I did, because ""Harry Potter"" is with me more than 10 years and I couldn't have imagine that it will end so perfectly on the big screen. I loved the Tale of the Prince, the scene where Snape was hugging Lily. I loved the kiss between Ron and Hermione in the Chamber of Secrets after they've destroyed the Horcrux. I loved the final battle between Harry and Voldemort, with all the extra, exciting scenes that weren't in the book. I loved the ending scene, with the old Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Draco. Basically, I loved the whole thing so much, that this is probably my favorite Harry Potter film - EVER. I cried at the ending seeing the old faces of my favorite heroes and I cried because there's no more Harry Potter. Thank you J. K. Rowling for creating this wonderful and magical world, that will always be my second home no matter what I do, wherever I go or which other book or world I discover. Thank you David Yates for finishing my favorite film series the way they deserve it. And thank you Daniel, Emma and Rupert for being the perfect Harry, Hermione and Ron. I will love you forever. Always.",

Yes I know I am a little late to the punch but frankly after reading the books and seeing the first three movies I kind of gave up on the movies. But Im really glad I decided to give them another chance. Yes they always skip a lot of stuff but I feel this one was done well mostly due to the fact they spilt it into two parts.,

378,5 March 2022,lokishq,10, Way too underrated,"I say that generally for the whole Harry Potter movie franchise, but especially for this epic final part which proved that Harry Potter is not only a childish tale but a high quality movie series that contains all the elements to be one of the best movies ever. I'm a Potter fan and I did read all the books, but even without the amazing story this movie is a cinematic masterpiece and an amazing project in general.

I remember wanting to be Harry Potter. I was Harry Potter twice for Halloween, as a matter of fact, wandless and only armed with jack-o-lantern shaped box for keeping candy. And now, almost at age 18, I have created a new memory of my own, that of sitting next to my mother, and now my brother, in a dark theater, sobbing together at the thought that it really is the end of my favorite series, Harry Potter.",

384,8 August 2011,LazySod,7, And so the circle closes,"As an eight part in the series there's not a single reason to explain the story or its characters, they've been defined. And so this film starts running, and doesn't really pause until the very end of it. As a book translation I guess it doesn't do too bad of a job - most events of importance get a glimmer of screen time. I have no idea how it works on people that haven't read the books though.",
385,30 December 2011,MartinTeller,8, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"Taken on its own, it might be a little too much in terms of ""epic moments"" with something seemingly momentous occurring every few minutes. But in conjunction with Part 1, which feels rather uneventful, it probably makes more sense. It seems like a lot of the fat is gone, and from what I can recall of the book, it's edited down nicely into digestible chunks without too much exposition. More importantly, the godawful epilogue is actually transformed into something decent, without that misguided compulsion to tie everything up into neat little bows. Yes, some bits throughout are going to be rather confusing to anyone not familiar with the source material, but they're not really the intended audience anyway. Production values are high, as one would one expect, with massive battles that only occasionally get too busy. I would definitely prefer to watch this back-to-back with Part 1, but that time will come when the inevitable Super Ultra Mega Edition Blu-Ray box set is released.",

389,3 August 2011,Al_The_Strange,8, It (finally) ends!,"Ever since Harry Potter's introduction some ten years ago, I've always been eager to see how this finale would turn out (I am a big sucker for grand finales). After ten or so somber minutes of recapping the last film, this last hurrah starts off strong as the characters infiltrate a magical vault, before moving along to the ultimate Battle of Hogwarts. As far as finales go, I wouldn't dare rank the Hogwarts battle over my other favorite scenes. Even though it takes up over twenty minutes of screen time, something about the final battle didn't really strike me as exceptional; I suspect it's because the actual fighting is subdued to the background, with no real sense of progression, variety, or true peril. But after some sporadic bursts of fighting and mystery, the film finally gets into the final duel between Potter and Voldemort, which is pretty damn cool. There are also a number of other epic moments in the film that'll keep it lively, and will enthrall most die-hard fans. I felt there could have been a bigger punch, and there are just a few scenes that drag, but what we get is satisfying.",

391,14 April 2023,SafReviews,9, Good ending to a good franchise,"First time watching this movie and before watching it Philosopher's Stone was my favourite Harry Potter movie, but not anymore as this was slightly better. The story was just intriguing which I expected and there were some twists that I did not expect which just made the movie even better. It was nice to see the other characters, most of whom who have been in the franchise since Philosopher's Stone get more screen time and be more involved in the story especially Neville the unexpected hero. The last battle scene was just epic and the reasoning of how Harry was able to defeat Voldemort was amazing and well written. I got emotional towards the end because I felt the story was just a satisfying conclusion to franchise that was kind of part of my childhood with the first 2 movies and it was a great 8 weeks watching all of the movies in their entirety for the first time which I'm going to miss.",

There's been some decent moments (Sorcerer's Stone), excellent moments (Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire), and some miserable moments (Half-Blood Prince). With the final installment, the cast and crew pulled out all the stops to try to deliver the most epic film in the entire saga. The drama, tension, and action were revved up to the maximum to compete with the final book—which was also a plethora of drama, suspense, and resolution. And while the tone still isn't as sinister as the book it's referencing, Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 remains a very entertaining and emotionally-charged finale that wraps up the saga nicely.",

I've followed the books and movies for a good part of my childhood. The Deathly Hallows Part 2 was and everything and more I hoped it would be. I cried when I read the final book, but I wept when I saw this film. If I could go back and count it'd have to be at least seven times I felt my heart break, and then I realized that my childhood was coming to a close during the epilogue. It's been awhile since a movie has emotionally effected me that much. The performances in this film are so powerful and thrilling (namely Daniel Radcliffe and Alan Rickman), the detail of the film's location, costumes, art direction, music, and mostly cinematography blow all of other films out of the water. The most visually beautiful film of the series. I may sound biased because I'm such a huge fan of the series from such a young age, but even if I hadn't read any of the books I'd still think it's a piece of monumental cinema.",

It was a perfect way to end the series that we all know and love so much. The drama, the romance, the suspense, the thrills, the action, and everything that makes the last Harry Potter film, the best of the best. The film is also excellent for its secrets finally revealed, and all the surprises that are spilled out. The movie was brilliantly directed by the wonderful David Yates, and it was expertly written by the unique Steve Kloves. Both Yates and Kloves bring back the dark adventures of Harrry, Ron, & Hermione for the very last time. And similar to Part 1, it also takes us back to the many wonderful and charming icons from the previous films, and has all returned for a more dark and epic version of the story. It made us all look back at the whimsical magic since ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" at the very beginning. And let's not forget the awesome cinematography, and spectacular visual effects, and all the amazing well-written scenes that bring the legacy of Harry Potter back to life. And also, it's our last chance to join the adventures of Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they set on their final chapter of their lives at Hogwarts. You have seen them grow throughout the years, and now they are facing serious sacrifices. Now, the movie was the best Harry Potter flick I've seen in years, and it will always bring back a precious childhood memory of the previous movies that we have all grown up with. So, this epic tale of courage, fear, faith, and power is all wrapped up into this wonderful package that we call ""The Harry Potter Finale"". ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"", in my review, ""a spectacular conclusion to one of the greatest franchises in movie history"".",
400,18 April 2014,felix-bergman,5, Falls short for expectations,"In some cases it is unfair to compare a movie to the book from which it was adopted, but when you split a movie into two parts to get as much of the story onto the screen, I see no excuse for a bad adaptation. After waiting years for this finale and after reading all the books, I was sure nothing could be bad about this, until I started watching that is. The first half hour - hour or so is not only quite accurate, but also really good, but as the Battle of Hogwats begins everything go downhill. It is all just a blur of people running around screaming and shouting inaudible curses at each other until all the character you should care about, but can't in this mess, are dead and not even after the battle has ended do we get to see what happened to all the people we worried about and that at least I felt sorry for while reading the book.",

Dividing the final book into 2 parts was a great decision, which made everything run more natural, it doesnt feel rushed in any aspect and the closure all the characters have is great. The story concludes how it should, it doesnt leave anything to interpretation and there are no unresolved plots left or anything.

The biggest problems with the other Potter films was over-length and ineffective juxtaposition, but this chapter suffers from neither. Yates is as fast-paced as ever and he blends multiple elements together effectively. The movie is spellbinding and grabs you from the start, not wandering like its precursor and gets us pretty much on every level.

The finale doesn't disappoint either. Didn't much care for the obligatory epilogue, but as it is from the book, Potterfiles would decry its exclusion. Shame that greed and length had to portion this film out in parts, as taken together they are remarkable; broken in two, slightly diminished in impact. Rather like taking a year long intermission at a wonderful play.",
422,16 June 2012,Bruce722,10, Magnificent conclusion to this epic story!,"An amazing and epic cinematic conclusion to the Harry Potter series. Of course, the books were far superior in every way but these last couple of movies really did do an amazing job capturing the meaning behind every scene which the earlier films couldn't quite do. The acting continued to improve in every film as did the development of the overall story arc and characters. I also felt like this was the best movie in terms of not needing to have read the books in order to fully engage in the story. Overall, I am very glad that I was able to complete the book series and films. This entire process has been an enjoyable one and that is the ultimate point of all mediums of entertainment, isn't it? To enjoy it? That's always been my belief and this story was absolutely captivating. I can't wait until the next time I can make it to Universal Studios to check out what I've heard is an amazing job at recreating the environment. Thank you J.K. Rowling for providing premium entertainment for my mind!",

It's just a big joke, they decided to cut half of the book, including some important scenes, but they also decided to change what happens and when it happens. They added stuff and made some impossible things possible in the movie. In the end, it's a movie showing off all you can do special effect-wise, they focused on that and chose the scenes they would do from the books based on whether they would allow theme to show off or not, and left big chunks of the story. I re-read the book just before and it's just a shocking movie in the end. I can not believe JK Rowling said yes to that. She must really like money. But it's not like it's a new thing in the Harry Potter series. Half of the movies are lame, disrespectful to the original world, and focused on minor parts while leaving important story parts left abandoned.",

The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess.

436,23 May 2022,dakuchonekobing,6, It's good but I understand why it didn't get an Oscar,"This is the end of a series that is famous around the world, the childhood of many young people around the world, I understand the director's burden when making this film. Especially since this is a movie adaptation of a book. The visual effects are quite nice, but the battle scenes all take place in dark places, making me sometimes feel uncomfortable, just hoping for a quick morning. The action scenes in the movie are also not very interesting. And there are a few things I don't really like, why are the villains always ""waiting for so long"" when they take the initiative? Don't they want it to be over quickly? Sometimes I feel that Voldemort is so lenient, from the moment he let Horcrux into Bellatrix's bank, did he trust Bella that much? Doesn't look like a bad guy at all. And did he even let Neville finish his speech? And I wonder why Harry Potter is affected by wearing the Horcrux necklace when he himself is a Horcrux? And couldn't the dialogue between Hermione, Ron, and Harry get funnier when Harry talks about how he's going to go into the woods to meet Voldemort again? Lol If she was that worried about Harry, she would have run into the woods or did something instead of sitting still and asking ""I thought you were in the woods?"" As for the character of Professor Snape, I know the intention to transform the villain (or so most of us thought) of the previous 7 films into a kind character who sacrifices for others and becomes a ""silent hero"". I don't know how things play out in the book, but this transformation in the movie was so sudden, and I still couldn't adapt my emotions to empathize with the character of Snape. Mrs. Rowling probably wanted people to think well of teachers who were strict but loved and wanted the best for their students. But if you want an audience like me to sympathize with a person who is willing to sacrifice and suffer injustice for love and then wants to clear it up by ""take my tears, let you know the truth"", it seems bit too much. This character is more confusing to me than memorable. In general, the film is quite lengthy, the film circuit is simple and I personally feel this part is not as good as the previous one. Many people say this part is better than the book, so I should feel lucky that I didn't read it.",

Told in books, played through computer games and now turned into movies with websites, forums and fan clubs based on ""the boy who lived,"" Harry Potter has become an iconic symbol of British/world culture with the values of trust, honesty, friendship, love and courage lots of human beings show everyday.

First of all the characters make this movie and the entire saga legendary, as they all have their remarkable characteristics and personal conflicts.

444,15 July 2011,tj19,9," Good, not great","Part 2 of the final installment of the Harry Potter series begins as Harry, Ron, and Hermione continue their quest of tracking down and destroying Lord Voldemort's three remaining Horcruxes, the dark magical items posed as everyday things that are responsible for his immortality. But as the legendary Deathly Hallows are uncovered, Voldemort finds out about their mission, the fight of good against evil will come to an explosive end. Deathly Hallows: Part 2 picks up right where Part 1 left off, searching for Horcruxes. I was never really a fan of the Horcruxes plot line, but I had always tolerated it as I read the novels because even though it felt like a plot line that would be in a sub-par video game, it still felt planned, thanks to Tom Riddle's diary back in Chamber of Secrets. The Horcruxes plot line also worked well on the pages, because they were spread out in the book. However, on screen, it felt repetitive and tedious, with little to no break in between each one, especially in Part 2. Part 1 was an atmospheric and emotional movie, and even though it was basically a prelude to the conclusion of the series, it stood alone as a film rather well. Part 2 was supposed to be action-packed and also emotional, and while it was action-packed (although it felt like it took forever to get there), it wasn't as emotional as I had hoped it would be. The film felt a bit rushed and was single-noted. Part 2 is the shortest Potter installment, and it felt like it. Many scenes left me wanting more. The single-noted aspect made the film feel incomplete. It felt like it was strictly about Horcruxes and the Potter/Voldemort confrontation, with some other sub-plots barely sprinkled in. Maybe if they hadn't split the film in two, but made it one long film, it would have felt more complete. The acting was as solid as ever, with Daniel Radcliffe giving his best performance of the series. Ralph Fiennes was as evil as ever and Alan Rickman gave his best performance in the series too, as Snape. Everyone else was solid as well, but unfortunately we don't get to see them nearly as much, which was a shame. The visual effects were top-notch and can only be rivaled by Deathly Hallows: Part 1. The spell-casting, creatures, and explosions were dazzling and suitably, magical. Some of the CGI was a bit spotty, but I honestly can remember only one instance and it literally lasted two seconds. I loved that the film was all about how there is darkness in all of us, but we can learn how to overcome it. We learn quickly that no character in this series (including Dumbledore) is totally pure, and Harry must completely accept this or else he will fail. Overall, as a film, it's a good one. But when you deal with sequels and a series, as well as the most famous book series of all time, as well as expectation, Part 2 doesn't make the grade. I expected a lot more, and didn't get it. It felt rushed and wasn't at all cathartic, which is what a Potter fan who not only grew up reading the books but grew up watching the films as well was deserving of. There are a lot of variables as to why the film was not excellent, and one could argue Book 7 was one of the weaker books anyway. Still, it's a good movie and whenever you deal with an ending people are very critical if it is not exactly they way they envisioned it. Harry Potter was one of the greatest film series of all time, and even though Part 2 wasn't the best, I'm still satisfied with the series as a whole, which stuck to the books faithfully, upheld Rowling's wishes, stuck with the same actors, and above all, stayed consistently great with four different directors and the transition from kid-friendly to much, much darker themes. That is an achievement unto itself. In the 10 years since Harry's big-screen debut, the spell has never been broken.",

446,14 July 2011,fernandius,10, This is it and it's excellent,"I just saw the movie and I have to admit that it is an impressive film, it has it all. Unlike the more recent prequels, this time we enjoyed a good story and not just teen romance. This film has a visual quality that is worthy of 3D. It has great colors and textures, although it is known that it was not done from the beginning in this format but it is still pretty good at it. The picture is a bit dark, I hope it's only because of the 3D glasses. If you did not read the book you can see that this history is full of surprises, twists and unexpected and exciting moments. However I recommend that if children are going to see this movie they do it only in the company of their parents because of certain scenes which area a bit strong, specifically deaths. I'm sure every fan of the series who watch this movie will be pleased and those who are not will also enjoy it very much. I feel fortunate to have been part of this part of history for the cinema, no doubt this latest movie is the best of all of the eight. It is full of information, emotions, romance, drama, fights and everything that is entertaining and heartwarming we can think of. Maybe this is not the best movie of the decade buy I am sure Harry Potter's movies will be some of the ""you have to see movies"" for any movies lover.

455,25 June 2012,jonnyfendi,7, Be Proud To Be Harry Potter's Generation!,"We have finally come to the last page of J.K. Rowling's epic saga. Thiz is the final adventure of wonder boy wizard Harry Potter. The seventh and last book split into two separate movies. To be honest, it's very hard to criticize since the movies were shot back-to-back. In other words, these movies are actually one movie. The opening sequence has a very slow pace of storytelling which allows every detail can be described better. There is no need for further explanation. The story starts right away, showing the preparation of dark lord to hunt Harry Potter and the dark atmosphere surrounding Hogwarts which is now ruled by Professor Snape (Alan Rickman). Meanwhile, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) continue on their journey to find the last Horcruxes. The story eventually has some twists to throw at the end of the movie, but for most of the fans it will not be a twist anymore since they had already read the series books before thiz movie. The final battle between Harry Potter and the dark lord himself is one of the most highly anticipated scenes. The long awaited climax event is perfectly told, it looks like Daniel Radcliffe has done his best, but I think what makes that final scene so intense is also a splendid acting improvisation by Ralph Fiennes as You-Know-Who. Thiz movie is still directed by David Yates who has been the Director of thiz epic since ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" (2007), ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" (2009) and, of course, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly hallows: Part 1"" (2010). Once again, thiz franchise has already become a part of each and every one of us. You will easily agree thiz statement (Spoiler Alert!), especially when we come to the end of the movie which tells Harry Potter, his wife Ginny (Bonnie Wright), Ron and Hermione send their children off to Hogwarts school from platform 3 ¾. In that very moment, we realize what we've just seen is not just Harry Potter, but it is all of us who have become older and mature during thiz franchise. Be proud to be Harry Potter's generation! ",

460,8 November 2022,dealandspamharley,9, A great film to end the series!,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great film because it has all the components of a well-built story - an action-packed beginning, a suspenseful climax, and a resolution that brings closure to the series. At the beginning of the movie, the audience is immediately met with action. For example, while hunting for the Hufflepuff cup, Harry Potter is almost drowned by trophies, attacked by death eaters, and escapes on a dragon (Harry Potter). As the movie progresses, the audience is met with the climax: Harry Potter and Voldemort's final battle. In the film, Harry Potter greets Voldemort by saying, ""Let us finish this as we started, Tom - - together"" (Harry Potter). This quote from the movie shows strong suspense because Voldemort and Harry Potter are dueling for the last time and the outcome of this final battle brings closure to the series. After Voldemort is defeated, the audience is left wondering what Harry's next plan is regarding the elder wand. When asked what he plans to do with it by Ron and Hermione, Harry responds by breaking it in half and throwing it into the abyss (Harry Potter). This represents the resolution of the movie because Harry Potter is breaking the most powerful wand in the world, showing that he doesn't deem its use necessary. Overall, the film showcases a well-built story and leaves nothing open for interpretation. Past readers and viewers will enjoy this last film of the series!",

So was this movie good, I say abracadabra bitch, or yes in muggle speak. I have seen every Harry Potter movie and enjoyed them all. I especially like how the movies (and I guess the books to) have matured with each passing film. They also went from somewhat structured like in the sorcerers stone to less predictable and original as time has passed. I saw this last one in IMAX 3D, I personally found the 3D to not be mind blowing, which I think is common among films not shot in 3D. So if I was you I would save the cash and see this in regular boring ole' 2D. So this movie just like the others is a little dark, has fascinating characters, a mystery to be solved and mysteries to be revealed. This movie delivers these Harry standards in spades. This movie was enjoyable except for the final scene for me. I won't spoil it but it is taken from the final books epilogue. It seemed tacked on and kind of pointless. I personally think much like star wars we have not seen the last Harry Potter film. I see the next one coming in about 10 years after the next Harry book by Rowling comes out called ""Harry Potter and the quest to find something else to write that failed and the search for more money."" I think the next one should be R with a little graphic interracial (muggle on wizard) hardcore action. So this movie is a worthy ending to the series, it answers all the questions, has a wide demographic base from young to old from magic nerd to jock. So go enjoy and be nerdy for a couple of hours, but just don't start here these movies for the most part should be watched in order. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",

468,12 September 2016,rajatshanu64,10, amazing series,the whole series was amazing i just like all the part and there is no reason to unlike it. there is no movie like this who just made magic to a another level and everything just beyond end is good everything is perfect that's it full entertainment and more then entertainment. however my favorite scene was from part 3 that time travel and harry and hermini travels to time to make things perfect that was my favorite scene in whole but i like it at all when you start watching first time first part you feel very amazing mostly when i see that pictures scene it just like real type gif files etc. but very real however maybe it can possible with technology not now not here but in future it will not all but some or more then some. the biggest story ever and and every part is interested that scene was quite funny when they are showing them selves after 19 year they are not looking old at all.,
469,17 July 2011,debanjanmk,9, An epic end of Magnificent Saga,"I was Quite thrilled to watch the the series end.The three musketeers have grown and given their best in this final film.while Alan Rikman perfectly portrayed the character of Severus Snape, his memories is the heart of the film.special effects are rocking.The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film. Neville cutting the head of Nagina is the show stealer.Dir. David Yates shows his brilliance in this film after a bit let down in Half Blood Prince.Sure it is the end of an era and even i clapped when the movie ended and happy with the winning of good over evil.",
470,27 April 2021,motrous,9, Deathly Hallows Part 2,Is it perfect? Probably not. But it was a good end to a decade's run of movies.,
471,9 April 2015,veyseldgn,10, Great Saga Ends,"Harry Potter was amazing history in our lives and with this chapter it is ending.I'm so glad that they split that last book into two movies. There's no way they could have told this story effectively in one film. This final Potter movie was both awe inspiring and emotionally draining. It really affected me in a way I've never been affected like in a movie before. I might as well admit it hear and now, this movie hammered on my emotional cords and I got chocked up and on the verge of tears, I was barely able to hold them back, but it didn't sound like the audience was able to, the person next to me was bawling her eyes out. The reason this movie affected me differently was because not only did a just get chocked up, but I was on the verge of breaking down through about 85% of the freaking' movie, which is ridiculous! I've never experienced that before. I wanted to cry through the whole movie!As a lifelong fan of the series, watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is what I imagine it would be like watching your kids graduate from high school: your heart swells, your eyes get a little misty, but more than anything else, you're left feeling satisfied in the presence of a huge milestone.",
472,5 March 2021,dskywalker0,9, Perfect ending,"This was a very good, beautifully done ending to this story. It's basically a complex war film with wands instead of guns; it carefully tied up the loose ends, still had ground-breaking revelations to the ones who hadn't read the book before it came out and it featured the epilogue. This whole franchise is a journey and it ends in jolly tears.",
473,27 July 2019,StonedMagician,9, Excellent: 9.5,"Ah, the end has arrived. The final chapter of the one of the most beloved and lucrative film franchises in history has come to a close at last. And what style it does this with. The only real weakness I can identify in this film is the fact that there really is no introduction to the characters of any kind. However, I understand this decision completely, because one really must see all seven previous films to care about the characters as much as they should. If one has not seen the prior installments, then one will not like this movie as much as they should. Oh, well. Their loss. There are a few reasons why this film is the best of the series. The directing style is probably the biggest change, with many artfully-placed shots highlighting exactly what needs to be at any given time. This is one of the last movies I expected to give a serious compliment to the director for, but I have been forced to eat my words. The art style is the next. It is in complete and utter service to the story, as it is almost ceaselessly bleak and dark. Major characters die on both sides. Evil triumphs for a spell (pardon the pun). War has arrived in the wizarding world. The final reason is the acting, which is easily the best of the series. Each actor and actress seems to have realized that they would never be revisiting these parts, so felt that they had to go out with a bang. And what a noise they made! All of these elements by themselves are not what makes this film so great. None of these aspects individually are anything truly spectacular. However, the fact that all three are so consistent in terms of quality throughout the entire thing make this film a noteworthy one. While there are no standout scenes like the one in Part 1 with our trio being chased through the woods by Death Eaters, this actually speaks as to the overall quality of the final product. The reason there are no outstanding scenes is because there are never any falterings, and dips in terms of the elegance or substance of the filmmaking. The overall tone of the film is another differentiating factor, and is one of the things that most people won't even really notice until the movie is over, that there is virtually no comic relief anywhere in the film. Instead, there is an almost relentless onrush of battle scenes which are so well done that they are worth the price of admission alone. Seeing the movie, it is obvious how much the cast and crew cared about this series, through all its ups and downs over the decade of the franchise's existence. It is thanks to this obvious dedication and commitment that truly makes this film and landmark title. Not in terms of cinema by any means, but in modern culture. Only a handful of other films are ones I can say the same for. And if you check my other reviews, they really aren't that hard to spot.",
474,1 January 2021,Thomas-Musings,10, Haunting and beautiful wrapup.,Loses two stars for starting the split-up final film bandwagon. JK. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a haunting and beautiful wrapup to the series.,
475,19 February 2023,ilpo-surokivi,9, 12 years later,And this movie hits completely different. I do remember watching this movie when I was 20 years old and I just didn't get some of the scenes back in the day. Good writing as a movie and now I'm glad they decided to do the last book as two movies. There's so much here and for me it's been even longer than 12 years since I read Deathly Hallows as book. It was shortly after the book was translated and released. Loved the book can't compare it because I simply don't remember it anymore.,
476,10 January 2018,hvkarateclub,1, HEADLINE: Harry Potter claims to have defeated dark lord.,"That would be the headline of the Daily Prophet the day after the battle. Absolutely nobody witnessed the fight. After so much was made in the other movies as to whether Harry really had seen and fought Voldemort how could they not have had the final battle witnessed by all the wizarding world. The greatest duel of all times and nobody was there to see it. Afterwards Harry walks into the school and everyone is like , hi harry , hey potter, ah by the way how'd it go out there. . It never ceases to amaze me, how a director , making millions of dollars, can make such a colossal blunder.",

478,5 June 2021,risbyceonna,10, EPIC,"I just wanted to say they've done a perfectly good job at closing everything out. We got to see the character's happy ending, Harry's development with his relationship with Voldemort and the character development of each character. This movie was and still is absolutely EPIC. What are you waiting for, give it a watch!!",
479,22 July 2011,bilcoolABU,10," Emotionally satisfying and visually breath-taking, heart-breaking yet beautiful","Deathly Hallows Part-2 has achieved something which no other Fantasy film has achieved, its definitely a fantasy but a very realistic fantasy.Every single ounce of agony and pain is real. From the start till the end its a roller-coaster ride, with no pregnant pauses in between. one of the many plus points of the film is that the battle never over shadows the main tale, and David Yates shows his expertise by dealing with two three story tracks going on at the same time as the main battle progresses in the background. As earth-shattering discoveries are made, the past is questioned and true loyalties are revealed,love still manages to blossom even in times of such darkness, thus giving out a strong message that LOVE indeed is universal.",
480,5 February 2022,catalinmarian-13885,9, So good!,"A great ending for the franchise that took over the world a few years ago. I personally have not been in touch with Harry Potter in the past and I regret now because I realized that I lost among the best fantasy franchises created, the world being so huge and very interesting. So for the last movie I had high expectations and got what I wanted. There is a lot more action, everything moves much faster and the final battle between good and evil is incredible and the end itself is a pleasant conclusion of all the movies. They even kept the best in the end!",
481,13 April 2023,ziancara,8, The Epic Conclusion We Were All Waiting For,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a thrilling and emotional conclusion to the beloved franchise that fans have been waiting for.

I just came back from seeing this with my family and we were all blown away. The first part was fantastic. The trailers of this gave me high hopes and I knew I was in for a treat The acting was spectacular. Every single actor and actress did their absolute best. To me, they get better and better through the films.",
483,13 July 2011,Seisaku,6, Snape memories,"I will make this short : the most beautiful and ""overwhelming"" scene from the final book - and though the entire saga - that is the memories from Snape with/toward Lilly is literally butchered by David Yates' filming. When you listen to Alexandre Desplat's piece of gem for this sequence and if you read the book first...well... you could have asked for much much much better ! This was meant to be a CLIMAX ! Of course the final sequence at the train station is very moving since it pulls you 10 years backwards when you got into those three funny fellows. But I strongly believe the most accurate sequence has been ruined... I'm very pleased anyway to have entered this saga from the beginning to its end.",
484,6 March 2012,artistgp,6, Eh....,"I will start by saying that I really enjoyed the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. I thought, for me, it was the best of the Harry Potter films. Part 2 isn't a horrible movie, it actually starts out with some really well shot scenes. Nice pacing and a serious tone to what's being set up.",
485,23 April 2013,ChristianUnchained,10, An Epic and Bittersweet Farewell,"This may just be the most true review I have ever written. And the most geeky praise review I have ever written. I truly have never come out of a movie with a feeling quite like leaving Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Pt. 2. Magical some have called it. Amazing others have labeled it. Personally, It was perfect. Don't take the confusion as a bad thing. Deathly Hallows is bloody brilliant. ",
486,2 May 2023,sufyaanrashid95,7, I liked it,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a fitting conclusion to the epic Harry Potter series. The movie picks up where Part 1 left off, with Harry, Ron, and Hermione on a mission to destroy the remaining Horcruxes and defeat Voldemort once and for all. The film is packed with action, emotion, and stunning visual effects that will leave you spellbound.",
487,17 August 2014,Tyson14,10, It All Ends,"Regardless of your views on Harry Potter as a whole or whether this film really does this literary phenomenon justice (on balance it does), there can be no doubt that this is a great climax to one of the great cinematic challenges. There will always be a debate about the place of J.K. Rowling's novels and their film adaptations in the wider pantheon of literary and film history. But if one wants a true measure of how good this series has been, they should simply ask: what would the world be like if Harry hadn't been helped out of his cupboard?",
488,14 August 2011,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,8, An end of an era,"Harry Potter, the boy who lived! Every child will know, and remember that name. The worldwide phenomenon has, I regret to say, indeed finished. How did it end? Magnificently. The idea of splitting the seventh part of the book was a brilliant economic trick (prolonging the flow of money given by the franchise). The first part gave a slow-paced introduction to the grand finale of the second movie. But, not without it's negative aspects. The tension that builds up to the end of the first part and continues from the very beginning of the second part dies somewhere at the middle of the second movie! It lasts for two hours, and somewhere at the end of the first hour the movie starts to slow down to a rate that is just not adequate to the first half. With a lot of tension and suspense, the movie does quite a bad job holding on to it. I must say that this is the very best HP screen adaptation in the franchise, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that it was just 5-10 brilliant sequences (e.c. the death of Snape) combined with not so great connection sequences (e.c. the constant interruption of battle with monologues). Also, the movie lacks characters! I had a feeling that Ron and Hermione had a lot less screen time than Nagini. Characters like prof. McGonagall, Hagrid, prof. Slughorn... had an embarrassingly small amount of screen time. Yes, the idea of the movie is the battle between Harry and Voldmort (who is the best-played character in the film) but that does not give the right to literally push out everyone else out of the picture. Do not be misled by these small complaints, the movie is brilliant. The most positive aspect of the movie are emotions! The death of Snape and the talk Harry has with his deceased friends and family is just heart-breaking and made the whole theater cry (myself included). Death is the main theme of this film from the very beginning, and the dark tone in the music and environment fits perfectly with it (sometimes I wondered if this is a film for children). Harry Potter gave us quite a ride through the years, and it ended just as it had started: magically! 8/10",
489,24 July 2021,brosseauphilippe,8, The last installment of the Harry Potter saga offers a lot.,"Whether it's the storyline, special effects and constant action. This is not my favorite movie of the saga, because I've always been more interested in episodes with a more jovial character that I found in the first four movies. In the qualities, the games of actors are less obvious, since the lamentable acting of Hermione is less present, but I must admit that I can't see another trio of actors playing their characters.",
490,20 March 2022,trapp_33,9, master piece end,"Its a great movie and this is a great ending for the series, the motion picture and cinema photography are good as usual, the story and plot are excellent and untouchable, The characters have developed and changed from the start of the series till the end in very reasonable and good way also the actors has done well all long the series and movie, a very wonderful and terrific way to end a great world that intrested and excited me. I will miss it so much.",
491,19 April 2019,alexklatt-28518,5, Good end I guess,"Not a bad end to the series. Very gray and melodramatic. I enjoyed it though. The redemption of Snape was definitely a highlight. The final battle was disappointing, but I felt that way when I read the book years ago. The epilogue was cheesy, especially the way they shoehorned in Albus Severus Potter's name, but I can forgive it. Pretty childish, but I think splitting the movie into two parts was a good move. It didn't feel super rushed. Pretty fun.",
492,18 July 2011,kingrahl,7, good but disappointing,Harry potter and the deathly hollows part 2! a good but disappointing film in my eyes. note i never read the books. so my complains in this review will be nothing based upon that. first the good. good 1 the film picks up where the other left off. 2 Voldermort is in a lot of scenes. 3 snape has emotion. 4 a lot of people die! 5 some great Battles. the bad. 1 everything was two rushed. 2 snape memory's went by way too quickly. 3 there was not connection between any of the characters. 4 two much action. 5 Voldermorts death was ridiculous! Bellatrix even more so! they died way two easily! 6 two many off screen deaths. 7 Harry not dieing after being shot with the death curse was completely ridiculous! it completely ruined the tension i was feeling after i thought he was no more. 8 if harry had to come back it should have at least appeared he was dead until the very last second before he fought you know who. in stead the audience already new he was alive almost right after he had been shot. 9 harry has kids with jenny. corny ending! again still a enjoyable film. but i expected something better for a finale!,
493,11 September 2011,zactac,10, Best Movie of the Summer and one of the Years Best! Fitting End to such a Grand Story!,"Ten years ago Harry Potter began and now, ten years later, it ends with a beauty and majesty that is unmatched by any other film in the series. Here is where everyone went all out, both in performance as well as artistic wise. Our beloved three main actors; Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, put on on the performances of their careers in this final Harry Potter. They unleash an emotional side of themselves that we haven't seen before in their movies while also showing the strength of their characters unlike we've ever seen in any other Harry Potter. However, alas, it is still nearly impossible for any actor in the movie to stand by the imposing figure of the scared and angry Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) as well as the intimidating and secretive Professor Snape (Alan Rickman); who also has an almost Darth Vaderish feel about him in this movie, and not be out-shined. Either way, besides the outstanding performances, the special effects team worked the most amazing kind of magic for the climatic final battle of Hogwarts. The posters show that Hogwarts is in ruin but seeing how it got there just sets an almost tearful mood for decade long fans (and even non-fans shall be tempted to shed a tear for the painful sight). The technical aspects of the film will blow anyone as much as the performances will. Altogether it will cause your eyes to blaze with the power from this film.",
494,3 February 2021,callie_af,8, Amazing finale,"An epic and emotional ending to the whole series. The montage of Snape is a particular highlight, as well as the great action sequences. Lots cut from the book, but understand why.",
495,30 July 2011,prazzanna,10, Ohh well...,"For the 100235th time,the movie ISN'T supposed to be EXACTLY like the book! If Inception was based on a book,and they had changed some plots from the book,people will still go crazy,saying that the movie sucked because it wasn't exactly like the book. The movie was intense. The music,cinematography everything was just...perfect! This movie,was the best in the series. Prince's tale was portrayed so beautifully,it's hard not to cry during this scene(I don't wanna spoil anything).The cast gave their best,especially,Alan Rickman. They DID go out with a bang. It's emotional,action packed,epic and funny at times.A perfect send off,one could wish for.Long live Harry Potter! IMHO 10/10 It was a great MOVIE!",
496,21 August 2011,KingFarticus,10, harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2,"I have nothing to say but astounding.Ultimately the best Harry Potter film of all time.I must say that it truly was an excellent performance by Danielle Radcliffe,Matthew Lewis,Ralph Fiennes,Maggie Smith,and of course the whole movie has to go to Alan Rickman.The movie was very intense and was a good ending for the Harry Potter Franchise,and i hope that if J.K. Rowling ever writes another book (will probably be about Harry,Ron,and Hermione's kids going to Hogwarts)then Chris Columbus(director of the first two Potter movies)should step up again to direct.Then will the franchise be finally finished.But I cannot stop thinking about ""Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone"" compared to ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2"".Because everyone in the film has grown so much and,to cut a long storie short I would like to say a thanks to J.K. Rowling,Danielle Radcliffe,Rupert Grint,Emma Watson,Chris Columbus,David Yates,and all the other directors of course,Oliver and James Phelps,Bonnie Wright,Alan Rickman,Maggie Smith,Michael Gambon,Richard Harris,Tom Felton,Matthew Lewis,Imelda Staunton,Robbie Coltrane,Ralph Fiennes,Helena Bonham Carter,Gary Oldman,David Thewlis,Jason Issacs,Evanna Lynch,and everybody else in the cast or crew.Thank you Harry Potter!",

I was looking forward to amazing battle scenes from all the various wizards at Hogwarts. I was very underwhelmed by the action sequences. They had all been done before. I was hoping for emotion from the defense of the castle. The deaths of major characters were just glossed over in about 30 seconds.

502,14 April 2017,jkd15-1,6, Best of a disappointing series though rushed to market.,"The end of the book, from a fantastic series, was incredibly exhilarating. None of this was brought forth in this series ending movie. The ending was off from the book and frankly, just not very good. Even for someone that didn't read the books which is probably rare, the anticlimactic ending was a letdown.",
503,11 July 2021,skipperkd,5, Hit and miss,"Some parts were spot on, particularly the entire scene at Gringots, McGonagal's battle prep at Hogwarts, Longbottom's scenes, the afterlife scene at King's Cross, and the penultimate encounter with Voldemort in the forest. However, the final duel with V was a letdown because there was no crowd of hopeful- fearful watchers all around, differing from the book. Not even Ron and Hermione witnessed the death duel. So that felt weak, lackluster. The movie also left out the post-battle scene in Dumbledore's office. Bummer. The epilogue at train station was okay, but for me the acting was too serious and staid, not enough joy and merriment.",
504,20 July 2011,RiceBunnyx,10, Perfect,"All of the Harry Potter films have been phenomenal, but this one stands out. Part 1 has been noted to lack action, but Part 2 is a masterpiece! Everyone knows the story, Harry, Ron and Hermione are hunting for the last Horcruxes, which are Voldemort's secret to immortality, and everything ends with the final, epic battle between Harry and Voldemort. The film follows the book brilliantly, but I have to admit the beginning felt a little rushed. Many fans, including myself, expressed disappointment in the fact that many scenes are missing, such as Dumbledore's back story and Fred Weasley's death, which makes many parts of the film confusing for people who haven't read the books, but nevertheless, Harry Potter goes out with a bang. I loved the final duel between Harry and Voldemort, which doesn't happen in the book, and was completely action packed and utterly brilliant. Ron and Hermione's kiss was long awaited and doesn't disappoint, although keeping it the same as in the book would probably have been better. The scene in the Great Hall where Harry, Ron and Hermione mourn Fred, Lupin and Tonk's deaths is extremely emotional, but as I said, showing Fred's death would have been better, partcially as those who haven't read the book may be confused as to which Weasley died. His death in the book is such a powerful moment between the Weasley's, mainly Percy, who in past films abandoned his family, and the whole moment just brings them all together. The scene still brought tears to my eyes as both Fred and George are my favourite HP characters. Another of my favourite scenes is when Harry has the Resurrection Stone and is reunited with his parents, Sirius and Lupin. Although I have to say, the best moment in the entire film was Snape's memories. Alan Rickman seriously deserves an Oscar for his performance! The scene really pulls things together, revealing Snape's past and many other things. Oh, and the epilogue scene was very good. Personally, I would have liked it to be longer and feature more of the moments in the book, such as formal introductions to Harry and Ginny's and Ron and Hermione's children. I would have also have loved to see Teddy Lupin, who I was looking forward to seeing, as well as James running up to his family and shouting out that Teddy and Victoire were kissing. When Harry hugged his youngest son, Albus I cried a little inside. Arthur Bowen is the perfect choice for Albus Potter, and I adore the scene between them. That ending makes me wish that JK Rowling writes another HP book, this time about Albus's first year at Hogwarts. The epilogue is another of my favourite scenes, and I love the fact that they kept the original music from the Philosopher's Stone as well. When watching that scene I held onto my friend and we both cried. Overall, the best possible way to end the Harry Potter films. That was an incredible decade and will never be forgotten. Thank you JK for sharing this with the world! xx",
505,15 July 2011,pujya29,6, Harry takes on Voldemort in this last movie.,Like all the anticipated Harry Potter fans I have been waiting to watch this movie.

506,26 September 2019,ierenz,7, I had a marvelous time.,"Everyone returns, including the brother and dead sister of the beloved Professor Dumbledore, who live in an oil painting, and even the ghost of Dumbledore himself, played once again by Michael Gambon. Hogwarts is now in the malevolent hands of the sinister Severus Snape (hissing, sniveling Alan Rickman), who is holding students and staff hostage as they wait for Harry to rescue them. The walls and platforms that hold up Hogwarts crumble and collapse like Tinker Toys in a masterpiece of destruction, turning the school of magic into the world's most colossal rubbish heap. A humongous man-eating snake with fangs that strike the audience in 3-D almost devours Hermione, while Ron narrowly escapes a cauldron of flames on a broomstick. With Hogwarts gone and almost every member of the cast killed off by Voldemort, there could obviously never be another installment. But there's still time for tender-hearted Professor Minerva McGonagell (Maggie Smith) to save the day with a spell she's been waiting for years to try. There is even a flashback that explains the sinister role Snape played in Harry's life story that I found unexpectedly touching. The only thing left to do to bring this saga to a heart-stopping conclusion is for Harry to enter the forbidden forest of death like a true hero and face his destiny with Voldemort, played one last time by the hatchet-faced Ralph Fiennes, who actually shows his human side for the first time. Frankly, I'm sorry to see him go.",

510,12 June 2013,claudemercure,8, the series ends on a high note,"Harry and his friends make their way back to Hogwarts for a final confrontation. By this point it's clear that this is no longer a children's fantasy story. The stakes are kept high by a sizable body count and heavy themes such as self-sacrifice. The film is anchored by Harry's weighty realization that he is a horcrux and that he must die. J.K. Rowling's clever final plot turns remain intact, including a moving trip through Snape's memories. Slight changes – such as having Harry and Voldemort confront each other away from everyone else – render the climax a bit less memorable than it might've been.

I follow IMDb .. been following it for the last two or three years if a movie is rated 7-8 or above i would run to theater or buy a DVD but fans giving movies like this 9 or 10 disappoints me a lot.i suggest watch the movie only if u love harry series other then that prefer captain America or horrible bosses or Transfomers 3",
513,12 August 2011,terrellrobinson71,10, The Perfect Finale to a Remarkable Series,"I have been a Harry Potter fan for a long time, so I really surprised to find out that the final Harry Potter film ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" is the best of the eight films since the first four films. In ""Order of the Phoenix"", I thought that David Yates was making the story a bit dull, but it was still a good adaptation. In ""Half-Blood Prince"", Yates made the story better and leaner and funnier than ever and he became a rather ordinary to an extraordinary filmmaker. In the first half of the ""Deathly Hallows"", he succeeded again only to bring in a lot of the rising danger that our three heroes had to face and he did that with the help of composer Alexandre Desplat. Now in ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"", Yates has become a full-fledged director who knows how to pull all the right stops and he, like screenplay writer Steve Kloves (who didn't adapt the 5th book in J.K. Rowling's series), manages to stay true to Rowling's books by bringing us to the edges of darkness. In the end of ""Deathly Hallows Part 1"" Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) possessed the Elder Wand from the dead Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and in the beginning of ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"", Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) has finally reached the breaking points in their friendship. They are still in search of the Horcruxes (fragments of Voldemort's soul) and it is bringing them back to the place when they were taught how to do magic: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It's now owned by the Death Eaters and Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), the magic has crumbled and the dementors are keeping a lookout for the trio. A lot of our favorite characters are back and some get some huge screen time including Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis, even stronger than ""Order of the Phoenix"") and Professor McGonagall (the ferocious Maggie Smith). The Battle of Hogwarts itself is very shocking and very scary. Lives are lost, one has to make a sacrifice and there are a few people who are willing to survive and to live another day. I am seriously not spoiling anything here. But we do get to know the back story of Snape and the long-awaited battle of Voldemort and Harry. Yes, there are also a few fan moments that we have expecting to see, especially a battle between Mrs. Weasley (Julie Walters) and Bellatrix (Helena Bonham Carter) and the incredibly emotional finale set 19 years later. (I won't explain the rest). At 2 hours and 10 minutes, ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"" is the shortest of the series and it manages to still stay true to the second half of the book. It is devastating, funny, sharply written and brilliant at its very best. I'll give you a warning though for those entering in: It's extremely violent for a PG-13 and then again, it's perfectly safe. I loved the books and I've admired the films for over 10 years now and it's great to see how Radcliffe, Grint and Watson grown from young up-and-coming actors to real grown-up actors now. It's very remarkable. P.S: I went to go see it in 2D instead of 3D, but then again, it's your choice. This is, not only the best of the series or the best summer film of the year, but it is the best film I've seen in 2011. Period. It's the best finale yet and, yes, I am comparing them to the finales of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"". They were epic in every way and now this one is an epic that stays on its own. I advise you see it, for Harry Potter fans only.",

It's been 10 years since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first movie in the epic, was released. In those 10 years, we've watched Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Matthew Lewis and Tom Felton, grow from children into young adults. After his unfortunate passing the late Richard Harris, who played Professor Dumbledore in the first two films, was replaced by Michael Gambon, who stepped in and built upon the wonderful work done by his predecessor. Alan Rickman, previously most notable for portraying Hans Gruber in Die Hard, gives his most endearing performance as Professor Severus Snape; and Matthew Lewis' does a fantastic job of giving a top-notch portrayal of a mature and no longer reserved Neville Longbottom. Over the years we were amazed while watching characters we'd read about be brought to life on the big screen; we allowed ourselves to develop relationships with the characters as they themselves developed relationships; we cried, as character we grew to care about sacrificed themselves to help protect our young hero to be; we laughed as the Dursleys got their comeuppance for their terrible mistreating of Harry; and we watched anxiously, awaiting the inevitable showdown with Voldemort. Very much in the same way that thanks to Star Wars, Mark Hamil will always be known as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher will always be known as Princess Leia, and Harrison Ford will always be known as Hans Solo; Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint will always be known as Harry, Hermione and Ron.",

Like a lot of the other Harry Potter movies, every scene is either great or brilliant. This movie had almost the same level of surprises as Prisoner of Azkaban did, but the action was better in Deathly Hallows 2 and it also had more dramatic scenes (like the resurrection stone scene, Voldemort's final defeat etc) than Prisoner of Azkaban. My only minor criticism is I think the movie was a tad too focused on action, some more dialogue between Harry and his dead parents would've been lovely. Deathly Hallows Part II is the 6th best movie of all time in my opinion.",
530,15 July 2011,markwoo,4," Good, but not good enough","It is a truly sad reflection on the film industry that, with the commercial success of this film practically guaranteed, HP8 was not far better; especially with amount of CGI thrown at it. If you have read the book, then, most likely, you will find HP8 a rather pedestrian stroll through the main scenes, nothing more. Where there are changes, these detract from the book and some are positively dreadful! Potter fans beware. As for the final scenes with HP versus Voldemort, what an awful distortion of the book. I am astonished that JKR allowed such a travesty. The exploding bodies and snake were laughable. A scene that more closely followed the book would have really lifted the film but I guess the people behind the camera realised (if they had not had this horrible realisation ages ago) that Radcliffe simply could not have pulled it off. It is such a pity he was chosen the role he is far too wooden. That said, Radcliffe does perform slightly better in this one though, sadly that is saying very little. The final scene – 19 years later – should be cut, it was pathetic. I watched the 3D version and it added nothing so save your money and go and see the 2D one. The stand out performer of the series is Alan Rickman. It is a pity that Richard Harris died he was a far superior Dumbledore. I have given the film a very kind rating of 5.",

I've read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows nine times. This does the book no justice. There's a ridiculous amount of effects that don't belong in the movie, discontinuity and missed potential. They seriously traded in an epic battle in the great hall for Voldemort slapping Harry. I wrote down a list last time watching and was able to find over a hundred legitimate problems I had with the movie. Worst of all is this movie had no depth. The book has beautiful themes of love that are entirely absent from this movie. This is even more bothering when you go back to the first three movies which touch on this theme so not only is it ignoring the book, but also the precious movies. In the first, Dumbledore has a moving speech about the scar love leaves and in the book Harry sacrifices himself with this intention. The movie wastes this potential with a corny scene that has no impact on the themes and characters. The entire movie is loaded with these types of ridiculous changes. It doesn't deserve half the love it gets.",

This movie is simply epic, and while the spaces for the most part are confined, it is on a grand scale. Unlike the last movie, by like all the others previous, most of the action takes place at Hogwarts, which for some reason they changed the architecture to.

The beginning of the movie is the weakest section of the movie, it starts with hard to follow exposition that probably weakens all the movies in the series after the first two. Though of all the movie this one is not to long, like most of them. It only gets better and more exciting as time goes on. It also is conclusive.
The first time I watched these movies I had a hard time following the plot and never understood Why Snape kills Dumboledore, but this time I get it. The second time around I finally got to appreciate the plot and details.
This is the most exciting movie in the series, and the Harry, Hermione, and Ron all get their moments to shine, but even Mcgonogal and Nevile get their moments to shine. (And it is awesome). Ron and Hermione finally get together after 8 movies and I it so happy. Some of the side characters' deaths are just glossed over and don't land.
I don't have much to say about this movie. I love the final battle between Harry and Voldemort. When all the horecruxes are destroyed it is awesome.
I don't really understand Snape's character I can't tell if you are supposed to like him because Lilly (Harry's Mom) is his only motivation. If that is thing stopping him from being evil I am not sure I like him.
This movie is the conclusion and it wraps up the story of all 8 movies great and is and awesome, heroic ending that makes you feel good. (Especially since it was so grim.)",

I have no idea why they would promote it as an entire movie, because it is just not. Walking out of the cinema I felt disappointed beyond believe. There is nothing that makes this movie ( scene ) special at all. Although I must say that the acting of most of the actors is pretty good.

In the defence for the Director and Producers I would imagine there was just far too much to cram in to the film and some of it possibly wouldn't have translated well on to screen so this has to be forgiven. Doesn't it? Any way I have loved all the films from year 1 to year 7 and it was nice to have David Yates back to direct this one.

However, the music we love, the music we remember are the themes Williams employs with ever film he scores, giving characters unique music cues that help the audience identify with them when they appear. We wouldn't feel about Potter the way we do without those themes, as his contributions to cinema are vastly underrated and underappreciated. John Williams is the greatest film composer of all time for a reason. He's just brilliant. He can take any piece of cinema and turn it into one of thrilling amazement without the viewer understanding that it is music that brings the visceral connection most people subconsciously identify. Williams scores make movies great and memorable. Where would Indiana Jones, Superman, ET, and Luke Skywalker be without John Williams giving us a cue that help us ""feel"" the way we do about them. So to give Williams a tiny credit at the end of this movie is a disservice to the composer. The final shot of the movie is one that makes us laugh, makes us cry, gives us emotional connection because it is John Williams music that underscores the final shot.",

568,16 July 2011,elvisrivet-1,8, The Perfect Potter Film,"Let me begin this review by saying that I'm a huge Potter Fan, I have all of the books and movies, I've enjoyed them all even if the movies do make changes to the books. But I have to say this film was the closest one to the book, it still made some changes to the material but as far as I'm concerned these changes were not that big, unlike the previous films in the series, fans of the book should enjoy this film as much as the non fans will. The film is quite short, the shortest of the series, running for about two hours and ten minutes.. But this also happens to be the best film in the series, the acting of the main lead actors has improved a lot since the first film which came out ten years ago, out of all three I have to say Daniel Radcliff is the best of the group, he delivers his line in such a perfect way, this is not to say the other two actors are not great, because they are in their own way. But as good as they are, they are no match for Alan Rickman who play's Snape with such an ease, Rickman is truly Snape I cannot picture anyone playing but Rickman, and you'll see why if you go and see this film, his acting has always been great in the films but in this one he really delivers a truly developed character that you feel for, even if you happen to hate Snape. All of the other supporting actors are all great as well, but I had to mention the three main leads and Alan Rickman because they all steal the show, especially Rickman. As far as the story goes, this is the best of them all because the story is much more developed this time around, the stakes are high and you can just feel it. There's so much happening in the movie that you can hardly breath, not that this is a bad thing because it's a wonderful thing, the characters are even more developed this time around and it shows because you start to care for all of them even the characters that don't really matter to the story, they are all developed in their own way. The only problem I have with the movie is the battle it's a little short but this is only a minor problem and it does not stop the movie from being perfect in my option, I hope you guys enjoyed my review for the film, and I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did, thank you for taking time out of your day to read this.",

Having read each book multiple times, I had considered the movies a disgrace to the series, but recently, my opinion has been changing. After watching the premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 at Trafalgar Square, I had more than high expectations from this last movie, the movie which would ultimately draw the curtains to the most beautiful world that had ever been created.

I've never read the books and hear they leave out so much in the movies, so that is definitely my next Harry Potter adventure. With that in mind, let me continue on to the review of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.",
571,6 June 2020,priyadarshanmaity98,10, After all these time.... Always,"After all these time always it will be my favourite films of all time and my favourite franchise of all time full stop. So the movie starts just where it left off Harry, Hermione and Ron were getting ready to end it all! So they decided to go to gringotts and killed the next horcruxe and the next and the next one end order to eradicate you know who, you know what the evil brat voldemort that's what he is!. So the path to conquer the darkness is not that easy, so there are multiple twist and turns and stunning, emotional revealations coming to you will talk about that shortly. We returned to Hogwarts and our revolutionary Neville longbottom welcomes and Harry, Hermione and Ron meeting them they all rejoice for a short period of time while voldemort is gearing for attacking Hogwarts and rest you watch the movie and enjoy. Now coming to the movie this one is the best chapter in the franchise hands down, it is the shortest and most action packed film of the series, the stakes are immensely high this time the basic thing while concluding the chapter is to give fan service the convieneint way of setting up an action scene but no this film combines action setpieces and emotionally poignant drama so beautifully that you as an audience,fan will want to end this in a good way but wants to go to the finish line along with Harry and his freinds. The character development of all the primary characters are excellent, especially the portion of Snape the montage of Snape's past is directed so well that you will feel teary eyed. Alexandra desplat's rousing scored elevated the film in such a epic way that you feel why they didn't give the man the honour of the Oscars. It was so nice of him to include nicholar hoopers tragic melodious farewell of Dumbledore to the fantastic montage of snape. This is the way the whole movie comes full circle we started with the journey and while ending we need the past adventures, trauma to complete it. Eduardo serra's cinematography is grimy, gritty and melancholic at the same time,there is an element of dremyness in his lenses even if it is dark and gloomy for the most part the sense of magic never goes away. The special effects are astonishing. Every technical aspects United to make this film a great conclusion. Coming to the actors Daniel Radcliffe does all the heavy lifting of becoming a leader and also the part of a tortured soul brilliantly, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint all these are now legitimate great actors. Alan rickman's last hurrah is one of his best performance in the series and even the best in his filmography! All the other British thespians gave there all to this film. There are prominent characters who didn't get enough time to so there talents thats understandable cause there is so much going on in the film. But David Yates staged the scenes of these characters so well it makes us feel no! Every character has there own arc. Stuart Craig's production design is again top notch and Steve kloves screenplay is pitch perfect. And yeah Neville longbottom is super heroic the actor really shines in this movie. Is it an epic film no! It is an epic grounded fantasy film cause even if it is not real you still care for the characters we all grew up watching them grew up. So at the end this is the best conclusion ever no-one can match this note perfect ending and Jk Rowling because of her we witnessed such a great cinematic experience. And all good things must end.",

Well, its fast paced, unlike previous one.The movie starts on a high.(SPOILER)The Gringotts Bank scene,excellently coordinated,pulls you in the movie instantly.All the scenes are absolute visual treat. Few scenes are worth 3D viewing, but most are not.The movie has many scenes already in dark and the 3D glasses make them look even less bright. Watch it in 3D only if you have to,but I would recommend to watch in 2D. Harry, voldemort and severus are deservedly given ample screenspace,but other characters(even important ones)are felt to have only a cameo.Even Nagini has longer role.(SPOILER)The ron-hermione kiss is aptly placed.Severus Snape's character has finally been done justice with!The wand-fight scenes are not as abysmal as in 6th movie but also not the best in the franchise, They craved for some background score! Silence works Yates,but too much use of it takes out its intensity.(SPOILER) It was great to see Molly and McGonagall in action.It intensifies the importance of the whole fight.Couldn't even spot Kingsley,Lupin,Fred-George,Arthur,Tonks . Neville is perfect! Excellent performances by Ralph Fiennes,Dan, Watson and Alan Rickman.",
577,31 August 2012,bethany-lewis,10," Full of excitement, wonderful movie!","A must-see end to the series of the magical Harry Potter world. I recommend it to all ages, all genders and all expectations. This grand finale starts off where part 1 of Deathly Hallows finished, with Harry crouching besides Dobby's grave. It is showing how the good is weak and evil are getting stronger, but Harry, Ron and Hermione are determined to hunt down the remaining horcruxes. After a heart-stopping trip to the bank, the threesome go to Hogwarts for the final battle. Many innocent lives are taken, with some main characters getting killed. Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint make an excellent job portraying their life-long characters, and though it's Emma's best film, she still lacks the chirisma from my point of view. The movie ends really well, but I'd have liked more of a bang at the end so the viewer could have been left wondering what was going to happen next.",

Even though Part 2 did diverge from the ending of the book, the reason its getting the rating I'm giving it is because I do appreciate what everyone working to give us the great stories that came off the books. The books didn't do the movies justice, but I enjoyed watching them and watching Dan Radcliffe portraying Harry going from a once small innocent boy to a slightly grizzled man, and a wonderful one at that. I do appreciate what he did for the series, and in my opinion, he has proved that he was the right guy to play Harry Potter over the last decade.

589,16 July 2011,troestrup,10, Wow...Fantastic ending on one of the greatest sagas ever!,"I was at the premiere in Denmark today (the 13th of July) and I simply do not know where to start, probably because I got a lot of thoughts and emotions running through my head and veins right now..At 02.45 am. (Excactly 2 hours and 45 minutes after the first midnight premiere of Harry Potter and the deathly Hallows part 2 started.) But let me begin with the size of this saga. From when the first Harry Potter book was released in 1997 (ever since I was a small boy at the age of 4) the Harry Potter-universe has just grown bigger and bigger. The effects have become more and more fascinating and exclusive, the mysteries and riddles have become numerous and besides of that our dear characters (naturally) have become older, smarter and (I can say this because I'm a male)some girls even got real women. And really beautiful ones as well. Now what I am trying to say is that Harry Potter has been a gigantic part of my life. (Not many sagas can say they have lasted for 14 years.) The Harry Potter series has always reflected my life in another world. A magic world. This was the place where I could be when I needed to dream myself away from our world's struggles. And I am not even shy to say that I even have (in my Harry Potter-trance-dreaming) been in love with Hermine Granger (Emma Watson), and realizing the truth wasn't easy for me in that age, so I always felt like I was stuck here in Denmark...I just couldn't get over there..To: London! Now that I am 18 years old, an adult, I know that it has always been a dream. But a very good dream :) So I still (especially now after this last movie) for some reason feel the burning desire to get up in the air and fly above London..And even above every capital city in the world. Because that's how huge the Harry Potter series is. Imagine EVERY SINGLE capital city of the world seen from above in ONE place (and then even at night with all the beautiful lights on.) Then you understand the size of the Harry Potter series when I watch it. (I hope it isn't too difficult to follow me.) So if there is anyone out there who feels kind of the same crazy addiction to the Harry Potter series, then PLEASE respond to me, invite me to your group or whatever you have...Because I really need to share the immortal Harry Potter series with somebody. Especially after this spectacular ending for which I thank the producers, directors, actors, actresses and the entire rest of the crew from all my heart. It really means a lot to me. It always did.",

From the first Harry Potter I've read(which is Prisoner of Azkaban) I fell in love with the series. Alone with The lord of the ring(hobbit included) it became my favorite story. It just has so much to it. So much spirit, heart and awesomeness. And now the end has come. OK that's enough of me rambling. So the screenplay. I thought it was pretty good, damn even really good. Of cause there are some lines that was much better in the book but the ending is awesome, I can even say that even though it's unlogical it's almost better then in the book(it would of been better if they said everything they said in the book during the fight). The acting is great. I loved leads perfomenses, loved Helena Bonham Carter and even though Alan could of done better than that I loved him too. The special effect's are the best I've seen. The 3D is awesome. It almost - yeah just almost - got that special book atmosphere. All in all it's the best movie about the young wizard and the best ending possible.

593,12 June 2012,a-orourke-292-969653,6, Better than the first part.,"After seeing the first part that I found boring I thought that Harry Potter part two was better. My rating: 6/10 (not so bad). My opinion about the movie is that it has very good special effects and that it is the only thing I liked the ""most"" in Harry Potter. The special effects are the most used details in Harry Potter movie and they are so excellent, especially the scene where we see the battle of Voldemort against Harry Potter and this is the scene I preferred the most in the film. It was so well done! But it doesn't mean that I found it super good. Not at all. I am not really a fan of Harry film. I never really understood the Harry Potter stories and it is too difficult for me to understand and to make sense with it. Probably because, I never read any of the books. Harry Potter is a very violent film with a lot of bloody scenes. It is too violent sometimes. My sister read some or every Harry books but not me. But I have to admit that some things are good in the film (like the special effects, of course). Harry Potter is a good story. I've seen the entire seven films and I preferred the second and fifth one (I think). It is very hard for me to understand Harry's stories. I saw it at the cinema in 3D and to be honest the 3D glasses didn't give anything special to the screen. It was so boring! I wonder if Harry Potter is a real success in the world. But for me it isn't. There are a lot of sad feelings in the Harry films. It is very sad sometimes. But it is scarry at the same time. I will give only 1 Oscar for Harry Potter film. Good try anyway. My name is Constantin and I am fourteen years old. Goodbye.",

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the most unforgettable, remarkable, and magical movie I have ever seen in my life. In my opinion its the greatest Harry Potter film. There is not one single flaw about it. Picking up where Deathly Hallows Part 1 leaves off, the viewer is immediately immersed into an incredible adventure with laughs, action, and of course magic. I'ts hard to believe that there will be no new Harry Potter's after this. Iv'e grown up with it and it's a huge part of my life. The ending is a perfect heartfelt goodbye to this long running series. Expect to be blown away be this film. Goodbye Harry Potter. We will miss you!! 10/10",

It is a good balance from the first part of The Deathly Hallows. The first part was more of a drama, while part two was action packed left and right. This may be my favorite movie of the series, though all of them are equally amazing. I have read the books, and there are definitely major changes in the movie, but I find they fit perfectly well with the story, even if it isn't the original plot. Even for those who haven't read the books (why wouldn't you?!), it is equally enjoyable. This movie, along with the rest in the series, will be loved for years and years to come.",

607,6 August 2011,Galaxian92,10, My childhood is over :( BEST FILM EVER!!!!,"Well, I never anticipated I would see the light of day when I would walk into the theater going to view the last and FINAL Harry Potter flick, and wouldn't you know it, I was stunned! This movie is not just the best HP film of them all, but is breathtaking, jaw-dropping, dazzling, shocking, and amazing movie-making at it's FINEST! Right from the very beginning, you are sucked into the end of it all, where the Wizarding World has now been corrupted by the evil and insanely dark Lord Voldemort and his posy of Death Eaters, and Harry, Hermione, and Ron must search for the remaining Horcruxes in order to once and for all defeat him for GOOD!!! It's prolonged action sequences, with spectacular special effects are the brim-hold of this film, and the emotional scenes are enough to make anyone cry their eyes out for a decade long for seeing these wonderful characters grow into fine actors. Daniel Radcliffe really gives it his all in the last moments of the film, and Alan Rickman's performance will show his sensitive side that WILL make people loose it. It is a Definitely well-crafted film monumental masterpiece, with Oscarworthy performances from the whole cast, Deep and Tragic scores from Alexandre Desplat that sound unlike any movie score I ever heard of, and matching that of John Williams(which his music ""Hedwig's theme"" makes an appearance in this one), and an Epic battle sequence that COMPLETELY butchers the last battle scene in ReturnOfTheKing into dust, there is nothing to stop this PERFECTLY SPECTACULAR MASTERPIECE from receiving ""the"" Oscar WIN for BEST PICTURE!!! I was in complete tears by the time it wrapped up, that I didn't know how to control myself. I was speechless! I will Definitely miss this series way too much :( :( :( Fans AND Movie-goers alike will absolutely LOVE this Epically Masterful conclusion to the BEST SERIES IN THE WORLD!!! 1,000,000,000/10 stars!!! GO WATCH IT NOW!!! YOU WONT REGRET IT =)",
608,17 July 2011,KahlilHerring,10, A finale that you will never forget!!,This is exactly what i expected it to be. For the people who say that this movie haves no character buildup and details for the book... Well THE CHARACTER BUILDUP WAS DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 1 and the other 6 movies before it. What they wanted to do in this movie was to LET EVERYTHING OUT. The previous movies just did this one justice. It was an all out war in Hogwarts. I mean they gave almost every student a fighting scene if you was paying attention in the background. Some people might say there was too much Harry and not other characters. I MEAN COME ON this is THE FINALE ALL I WANT TO SEE IS HARRY AND HOW THIS FANTASTIC 10 YEAR EPIC ADVENTURE ENDS. The only part they could have probably improved on was the epilogue and that is probably it. Overall the acting the emotions and the scenes were very well played out. 10out of 10. PERFECT MOVIE,

614,16 July 2011,originalconfidence,10, The world is sadder without Harry Potter,"I'm a 90s kid. I LITERALLY grew up reading, watching and absolutely LOVING the Harry Potter franchise films. I saw the first HP movie on its premiere when i was only 9, and having not read the books before, I was absolutely blown away with HP (I used to diss it but from this point, I was the biggest fan). As I grew up, so did the HP cast and I felt very emotionally attached to them as I kept on loving their movies. I was disappointed with films 5 - 7.5 and I really thought that David Yates had ruined the movies. However I was wrong as shown in this movie. Words aren't enough to describe this movie to the majority of teens around the world who grew up watching HP movies (like me). This is the first time I've literally burst out crying like mad in the cinemas. The Prince's Tale absolutely brought me to great big tears and My Previous fave HP movie (azkabhan) was overly topped by this one. In fact, I think this is my ALL TIME FAVE MOVIE. In my opinion, the Oscars have been ignoring the HP franchise way too much. This movie DESERVES TO WIN BEST PICTURE AT THE Oscars. Most 90s kids internationally admit that this franchise has kept them laughing and entertained throughout their teenage years and a franchise other than HP has never been beloved and gave so much happiness to a generation globally. I not only cried at the absolute tear breaking moving emotions displayed through mind blowing acting my Dan Radcliffe (His acting has improved enormously through out the movies, but his acting in this one was Oscar WORTHY for BEST ACTOR full stop), but the terrible fact that with HP over, I feel that my childhood is over (it really is)and since I am so emotionally attached to HP characters, I couldn't easily let them go. With HP ended, I feel my youth is ending and it is. HP kept my teenage years with something to look forward to in the cinemas through 10 years, and no other franchise in the world has achieved that. HP is the BEST and most beloved franchise in the world to the 90s kids and it won't change because HP not only represents the height of entertainment in our era, but it represents our youth and joyful memories of our school days. I am still very sad that HP is over, more than anyone. I've read all the books, watched all the movies, but I have to say, this movie is the best of all, the perfect finish to a perfect franchise. And whatever other overrated franchises like twilight may be a better representation of their youth to the minority, the majority of 90s kids around the world will always pick HP as their all time favorite franchise ever. It will go down in history not only with success in numbers but in the hearts of 90s kids and other youth of this era. I would be very disappointed if Daniel Radcliffe who is obviously a very talented and hard working professional actor does not win Best actor at the Oscars, because I've never seen an actor at his age display a character with such ground breaking emotion and reality. I would be more disappointed if this movie does not win Best Picture at the Oscars, because this movie is not just a movie, but a form of happiness that have kept the youth of our era entertained for a decade and that is something that is not likely to be achieved even in the future.",
615,25 March 2012,Kieth11,7, Disappointing,"The first movie, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 was really good, although I have never read the book, I loved it, and I wanted to see this one really badly, but it, I'm afraid, let me down tremendously. The roller coaster scene is unforgettable, and very well done. It's kind of funny and unexpected when they literally drop out of the cart. Other than that, the ending like, 45 minutes was really incredibly disappointing. It was stupid, and even with all the magic happening, seeing the whole time, pretty much two beams of light coming from a stick is boring, even when, sometimes an interesting thing happens in between each light display. Part 1 was really intense, and gave me a feeling as if a spider was crawling down my back, and there were very, very few, and short scenes like that in Part 2. I expected more.",

I found the scene in pensive, the best part. I think is not as good as Fantastic Beasts, is because the visuals are more up to date and there is not much to be disappointed with because the book Fantastic Beasts does not have an actual plot. However I think it is one of the best out of the HP series, and to be honest, I don't think another director could have done as good a job as David Yates, and the rest of the film crew!",

626,30 November 2011,mvedprakasha,8, The Conceptual Review,"The movie depicts the death of the ego of the person and hence I believe the name is made as deathly hallows. It answers all the questions of the author put forth in the beginning of story of HP. It describes that the ego is of 7 categories(Crux). Out of them few of the Crux is present in a student which has to be destroyed by the Teacher(Dumbledore). Few destroyed by friends(Destroyed by Ron).And the rest has to be killed by the enemies(Voldemort). The strength of the confidence has to be taken by the aid of the Knowledge of the Teacher by either conversation or the gathering of the good will to prepare ourself to destroy the evil may be either external or internal. Story also depicts that when the evil in oneself raises to such an extent that it can cause the death of him, then its always power of knowledge which embodies to survive him(HP surviving after the deathly blow). I think the direction has brought the immense truth of the feelings of the message that is needed to be conveyed by the story writer. The existence of life of ego(Voldemort) within HP, is made felt of the presence by the scar on his forehead. The scar could have been on any other part, but still its on the forehead indicating that ego raises as he develops,grows. At the point in life hp reaches a stage where he needs to tackle his enemy Voldemort(ego) where the ego itself kills its mere existence in the Harry, then the Knowledge of DumbleDore flows through him for the perish of voldemort, to attain the state of Bliss.",

If they had to make the film in a way like this, then one film was better than making two films. David Heyman is an amazing producer but David Yates a completely fowl director. He ruined the fifth sixth and seventh film and so he did with the eight film. He cut of everything. The beginning was very good, but the battle was quiet miserable. Most of the things was shown in the trailer , what happened in the battle and there was too much Harry in the film. Ron and Hermione even didn't appear much and the stupid David Yates deleted many things from the memory of Snape. The dead scene of Fred was also omitted. Ariana's story gone!!! Duel of Hermione, Ginny and Luna with Bellatrix gone. And the battle of Harry & Voldemort though they made it a bit longer it was still disappointing. There was no one to see and and thus what is the proof that Voldy is dead???? The film was good and enjoyable but I think a lot more could be expected from this film.",

The fact that this movie is good is more a testament to how great the story is. If you read the book you know some of the most important parts were either; excluded, rushed or just done badly. But in the end the overall story is so amazing that even a stripped down version is satisfying. Still the most disappointing part is that by splitting the book into 2 movies they had enough time to cover everything decently well. Instead they wasted time on irrelevant added scenes instead of showing the main fight/ending the way it should have been. In the end Harry and Voldemort circle each other as EVERYONE watched and Harry explained to Voldemort just how badly he had beaten him. In the end he even gave him a chance to feel remorse which he did not, Voldemort Loss is the ultimate Lost and Harry victory is the ultimate victory. But in the movie this is reduced to 3d effects. On top of that after the fight was over you could not tell if they had won or lost. There was no celebration, Hagrid patted Harry in the back like he had just won the spelling bee. I mean even if you did not read the book this is disappointing at that moment Harry just beat the most dangerous wizard of all time! he just ended the war! where is the celebration? There is more i could go into like how they rushed the pensive scene with the memories of Snape, but is useless because in the end people who just watch the movies are satisfied. But people who read the books know that it should have been amazing and instead it was just good.",

The fans do ruin it to a large extent but the films are also just predictable and boring. The last two did pleasantly surprise me though. The cheesy lines are replaced with actual humour and the action sequences are beautifully choreographed and fun to watch. The story line is deeper and darker than the rest of them (due to the change of director) which i believe is what this film series desperately needed. I will never understand why people love harry potter as much as they do but then again there are also people who believe the amazing spider-man 2 is good so apparently anything is possible now. Harry Potter on a whole is 4/10 but these last 2 are a solid 7/8-10 and David Yates saved these from plummeting to the ground.,

You'll LOVE it, you'll FEEL it.. but you will never prefer it over the book, just the way it should be. ",
655,13 August 2011,sniffle_wiffle,8, A satisfying end to a mixed series.,"At long last the end is here. After 10 years and billions at the box office, the final Harry Potter film arrives with a big bang and wallop, followed by sighs of relief from the filmmakers, and big groans from Warner Bros (will they ever find another franchise that makes this much money?). I personally have never truly loved the Harry Potter films. I mean I like them, they are entertaining flicks no doubt about that, but they haven't held the special place in my heart that the sublime ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy have done. However upon seeing this film, I have to say I was genuinely impressed. ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"" raises the quality level of the Harry Potter films to an all new high, and truly finishes off the series in a very good way. Maybe not perfect but certainly good.",

It is a movie franchise that started off when I was a kid - as so many of its fans were - and it ends with me and the characters growing up. The troublesome trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione are back for one final act of their epic fight over the greatest evil the magic world has ever seen and he is stronger than ever as well. The twists, the turns, the magic, the spells, the bright flashes from wands, the suicidal spells, the walking stone warrior guys, the heart in the movie, the kids standing up for what is right all o this and so much more make this movie so believable and multiple-watch worthy.",

661,21 July 2011,mirabid29,10, Can hardly be better than this,"It is indeed a grand ending, an ending of a saga, an ending of the story which holds multiple generations of both young and adult. The ending of this great series can hardly be better than this. All the actors acted brilliantly at the last part of the epic and almost everybody crossed their previous performances. Especially Daniel Radcliffe wonderfully depicted the inner struggle of Harry Potter. Tears came into my eyes when Snape (Alan Rickman) was holding his beloved Lily Potter's dead body in total despair. Rupert and Emma did an excellent job too. Steve Kloves's screenplay is simply great however the final fight between Harry and Voldemort could have been more dramatic. David Yates has given his best shot although I liked the Half Blood Prince a little bit more because of its story-telling or just may be that was a better book than The Deathly Hallows. Again, the ending of this immensely popular series can hardly be better than this. Being a huge fan of Harry Potter series I must admit that the makers did a complete justice with the original story. One last thing I must say that I think both of The Deathly Hollows (Part 1 and 2) surpassed the J.K. Rowling's novel by holding viewer's interest till the end which was not possible with the last six parts as the books from Philosopher's Stone to Half Blood Prince were too damn good. Deathly Hollows (the novel) is quite good but surprisingly I found the movies of Deathly Hollows (especially part 2) more entertaining.",

Well, I can't. I mean of course I can, but that would ruin the whole movie for you, and even though my heart is begging me to spoil everything, I want you to experience it for yourselves. I want you to feel the same way I did when I walked out of that cinema. And if you haven't read the book, do not worry since this is actually a great interpretation of the book unlike most of the previous movies (even though some minor things were off). I will give Harry Potter and the deathly hallows a perfect ten, and this based mainly on the flow of the movie. I loved the action, I loved the drama and I LOVED it all put together. But I will also give it perfect ten because of the way it made me feel. It made me feel sad on the sad moments, it made me feel happy on the happy parts, and it made my day at the end of the movie. Right now I only feel saddened because it is all over. But talk about going out with a bang!!!",

All the potter fans where extremely eager and excited to see the end of a very long and emotional journey. The movie started off with an amazing dark scene where dementors have surrounded Hogwarts and Professor Snape has become the headmaster of Hogwarts.

For example, the first and second have been good movies. But then the third which turns the book with the, in my opinion, most exciting story into a boring whatever. The fourth could be named as a ""nice try"" but everything after that was just boring stuff with exaggerated and obsessive special effects. One could get so much more out of this story, but also the last part was full of these things I've sad before: groundless protracted, useless effects, lame gags and a final battle that could'nt be more unspectacular; by the way: no more ideas since the fourth part, except this strange black and white smoke flying thing which is just ridiculous. no innovation, no profundity, no good film",

I entered the theater with low expectations and left with an afterthought. Sure, the writers couldn't have fit the whole book into the movie! No matter what anyone says, it, under most circumstances, can not be done. For example, (For anyone who read the book) when the house elves in the kitchen at Hogwarts are in danger and Ron informs Hermione about this, she gives him a passionate kiss for remembering (not in the movie). However, it is not stated in the movies about Hermione's cause for House-elves (S.P.E.W.) or any of them even knowing that House-elves worked at Hogwarts period.",

Just understand that it is practically impossible to show everything from the book in just 2 to 2.5 hours. Whatever is shown in the movie is just great, simply great, amazing and fully enjoyable. Obviously, if you have many expectations about each and every thing and you have already the book, then you might be disappointed about a few points. All the remaining horcruxes have been destroyed in the movie (obviously all of us know this;harry potter series cannot end without that). So some of the adventures have got very less time to emphasize their significance. But that does not really matter. Just go with zero expectations and you will come to know it is the best movie, Movie of the Decade. Just great! (watch in 3D)",

Part 2 picks up right where part 1 left us, at Shell Cottage after the narrow escape from Malfoy Manor. From there on it takes us on a fast paced, action packed adventure and the visual effects that go with it are simply astounding. The movie takes you in with raw emotion aided by some terrific acting and the whole film seems to be crafted so well that it flows beautifully from start to finish. It is the proper goodbye to the series that has captivated millions and been going for 13 years strong. However, I had to take off one star due to one reason. (spoiler alert) The ending of the battle and how it had been changed from the book. Referring of course to the fight between Harry and Voldemort. I understand why it had to be changed, to make it more intense and dramatic for the cinema but i didn't care for it. ",

If you read what i just wrote you'd be reading on anyway. But, they would say it was not good because the ending mostly. The worst thing about the whole movie is they didn't end the movie (Voldemort dying) the way the book did. In the movie, he just flaked away when he died and no one saw him die. In the book, if i remember right, everyone saw that his own killing curse rebounded and hit him. THats not what happened in the movie. Also, in the epilogue, you could tell the actors only had a cheap amount of makeup put on because they only looked about a year older than they were minutes before (in the movie). But otherwise this movie was extremely exceptional in all perspectives! everything was made and set out well, and i even believe this was the funniest movie out of all 8!

I was skeptical of these so-called children's books being produced for the big screen, at first. But after my nieces & nephews talked me into making the 90min. round trip to our local theater a few times, all of the sudden I was hooked. Nothing like LOTR's, but never was intended to be. This last chapter in the ""HP"" series has got to be the biggest surprise to me of all. I expected a freeze dried ending with a little icing on top (after DH1). Could not have been further from the truth. Great ending & some nice twists and turns between. A movie in my opinion well worth owning on it's own merits.If you watch ""DH1&2"" back to back...this gives the viewer a better idea of what I think the screen writers are trying to convey and absolutely gives the movie more of an even flow from beginning to end. Sounds excellent... I have a Bose 5:1 surround system and for visuals a Samsung LN46A650 and the visual are also A+ for this very well done blu-ray. It really is a keeper. Oh almost forgot the extras...you will need plenty of time examine them all. The DVD is also a nice touch.

Being someone who was a big fan of the books there are some things I wish they hadn't left out or changed. I feel like they didn't do the deaths of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks justice. They simply showed each dead body for a few moments and kept on going. Another thing they left out was the centaur charge. Instead of including this heroic moment, they simply had Harry jump out of Hagrid's hands and run off...not in line with the book at all. Now hey, don't get me wrong, I know I just pointed out a few negatives but there were way more positives than negatives. The acting was great, the special effects were awesome, and you really walked out of the theater feeling a lot of closure. Everything just tied together, it was wonderful. The scene with Harry sending his children to Hogwarts was great, I was really glad they included the epilogue in the film. All in all, I would strongly recommend this movie to any movie goer, and any Potter fan for that matter so long as they don't mind a few tweaks from the book.",

Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were again amazing as the three heroes Harry, Hermoine and Ron. But, Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom) and Julie Walters (Molly Weasley) had their big moments in this film. I cried when people died and had to close my eyes when my favourite character dies.

They are also portals to other portraits and have every means available to them to re-group, re-organize and start another literary world war. Beatrix Lestrange for instance, would surely enjoy training a pack of new slytherins with her dark magic and cruel intent, with only one aim. To destroy the world of good magic, and to take over the human world by force. ",
707,15 July 2011,jonaslady36,10, harry potter has to defeat voldemort once and for all,"so harry potter. the final chapter. it all ends. everyone has been anticipating this day ever since the first part of the 7th chapter came out. let me tell you. this is by far the best harry potter movie put out. not only does it contain super intense scenes, but it also has some really sad scenes. i mean it is SO SAD. like when snape dies. oh my god. he has been my favorite from the very beginning. i cant believe he is finally gone. and then in all of snapes memories its sooooooooo sad. he shows more emotion in those couple of minutes then he ever has in the whole harry potter series. and when he is crying over lilleys dead body. wow i just couldn't take it. but its not only because all of the people who die, its also because of the ending of the final chapter of harry potter. a chapter of our life. harry potter will live in our hearts forever, but for now, mischief managed.",

714,10 February 2020,diankhan-6038,9, How to this inspired me...,"When trying on the Sorting hat in The Philosopher's Stone, the Sorting hat suggests that it thinks Harry could do well in Slytherin. But he asks to be not sorted into Slytherin. In the end, the Sorting hat heeds his choice and places him in Gryffindor. Later on, in The Chamber of Secrets, when everyone thinks that Harry is the heir of Slytherin, he recounts the Sorting hat story to Dumbledore. And Dumbledore tells him, ""It is not our abilities that make us who we are, it is our choices.""
We often let our abilities and our position in society dictate who we are rather than make those choices ourselves. Becoming a billionaire is not about having a billion dollars, but about becoming the kind of person to make a billion dollars.
We need to make the right choices, and we will make the right choices when the choices are aligned with our values.
We can either let the world sort us and mould us based on the abilities and attitudes that we have, or we can make our choices and turn into the kind of people that need to make those choices come true.",

""After all this times?""
""Always.""

As always, the books were better. And while it's understandable there were some time constraints, so much was left out or altered that I wish could be put into an extended edition.
Overall, totally worth the time to watch. Just don't expect a word-for-word translation into film, especially the very end.",
719,15 July 2011,hp676,10, So good!,"This movie was definitely one of the best out of the eight. It included most major events and had effects that will blow your mind. As a true fan of the books I was a little angry at how they played out some of the battle. Here is my list 1) I wish they would have started the battle as they did in the book. It was similar but Snape never addresses the school and Harry, they only briefly meet in the hallway. 2) Some of the old characters that I was sooo excited to see return (Harry's old quidditch team, buckbeak) did not return as they did in the book. 3) There was a bit to much humor in certain moments that were supposed to be dark and intense. 4) They showed Fred dead but not his death, which was described in the book. They also left out the Weasleys' reunion with Percy, but it was expected as this conflict went back to the fifth book. Harry Going down to the Forbidden Forest, Harry never confronts anyone after he realizes what he has to do, as mentioned in the book Hermoine and Ron would have never let him go 5) The way Harry presented himself alive was different. In the book, Voldemort brings him up and gives his speech of liberation, and then and there Neville kills the snake, in which another fight breaks out. Harry slips on his cloak and watches as Hermoine, Ginny, and Luna battle Bellatrix and McGonnagal, Slughorn, and Kingsley battle Voldemort. The crowd gathers around these two fights until Molly Weasley steps in and kills Bellatrix. Voldemort then aims at her, until Harry protects her, revealing himself. Then they go on the circle each other and Harry explains why Voldemort cannot win. It was very intense in the book and it would to be in the movie. There was no chase scene around Hogwarts or diving off the tower, as there was in the movie Harry kills him and the Death Eaters run and the good storm Harry. In the movie no one sees him kill Voldemort and there really isn't a celebration. 6) Barely no Hagrid! I was beginning to think they left him out until they showed him tied up. I wish they showed him fighting. Also no Gwarp. (Hagrid's giant half-brother) 7) In the book Voldemort cannot feel when they destroy a Horcrux. 8) Voldemort kills Snape in the Shrieking Shack in the book but for some reason in the movie it was at the boathouse. That kinda bothered me. 9) If I had not read the books I would have been confused on the Tonks and Lupin relationship. They never actually say they got married or had a kid. Tonks mentions her husband and Harry later asks the ghost of Lupin about his son Teddy, who was never mentioned until that point. 10) They stayed away from the whole Dumbledore conflict, which i understand because it would have been hard to explain on top of everything else 11) Harry never breaks the Elder Wand, but uses it to repair his own, which was broken. He returns it to Dumbledore's grave and hopes that it will die with Harry, passing on to no one.",

His performance carried us the audience threw eight films ,but he was not alone, Jason Issacs Tom Felton Bonnie Wright Emma Watson Rupert Grint Helana Bonahm Carter Julie Walters Gary Oldman David Thewlis Emma Thompson John Hurt with Dame Maggie Smith and Sir Michael Gambon to name a few give the film their all ,and help Radcliffe go from boy to hero is just 7 years.

732,15 July 2011,grahamzkg,10, best harry potter film and best film of the year by far!,"now i'm not going to summarize what happened in the last part, because everyone knows what happened already.the first 20 minutes in deathly hallows part 2 start with out 3 heroes in the shell cottage planning to break into Gringotts for one of the final Horcruxes. if your going in expecting some huge heist scene, your going to be a little disappointed. its really short, which is fine because really all anyone honestly cares about is getting to Hogwarts. once they reach Hogwarts stuff starts to go down. Snape is aware of harry's presence on the grounds, death eaters are everywhere. this isn't the Hogwarts you remember 2 films ago. and thats when we really get into the thick of all of the action. some people complained that the battle of Hogwarts isn't very battle like. and thats a lie, the battle of Hogwarts has some of the best cgi effects that you'll see in a movie. from the giant mountain trolls, to the death eaters blowing apart the sections of the castle. but its not about the action its all about the emotion that is in this crazy battle. we see some of the lead characters laying face first in the rubble. but the most disturbing part of the battle was lavender brown having her neck chewed on by",

The Harry Potter series is one that has touched the hearts of millions of people on this earth, and I am one out of those millions! The film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallow Part 2 is truly epic. Joe Rowling created a world that touched the hearts of millions, and David Yates brought that onto the screen for ALL to see. Even though there were many 'liberties' taken by the director, it didn't even effect the grade of quality. The plot of thick, the effects were top-notch, the music out OUTSTANDING, and the cast had the great chemistry that makes you fall with love with their work. Over-all, the final installation of the Harry Potter series truly head up to its expectations. I watched it eight times in theaters, I own it on DVD, and the soundtrack is next on my list. If you are looking for a movie that fulfills expectations, and you can watch again and again Pick up Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2!",

All these actors give groundbreaking performances in making this the final movie. The movie definitely executed the main points of the movie, and made it feel so real and touching. Harry Potter fans and non Harry Potter will definitely love this movie. I was given the advantage to go to the midnight showing and the whole theater was in complete silence the whole movie, and you could even hear and see people shedding tears. It is an AWESOME movie, and it really does justice for the end of Harry Potter. I have read all the books, and seen all the movies, and this one has to be the best movie. I knew what was gonna happen and still had me on the edge of my seat, and I suggest this movie to everyone! It will not be a waste of your money. Great movie, great people, great ending.

Now I watched the first Harry Potter movie when I was at the age of 5 and it is so amazing that I grew up with this series. Now, Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2 was a great ending to this series. Some people say it really different from the book and I can't agree more. The thing is, this is great as an overall movie and I loved it. People were complaining about the death of Fred Weasley being such a small part of the movie but the truth is that the actor of George Weasley(Oliver Phelps) couldn't shoot the part for too long because seeing his brother dead was very emotional for him. The special effects were great! Hogwarts was looking like a real destroyed building and the explosions were great. Severus Snape's death was great and some of the actors perfected their parts. They made a great scene with James, Lily, Sirus, and Remus talking to Harry when he finds the Resurrection Stone and the death of Harry is also great when Dumbledore gets there. Neville did great too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good movie to watch",

745,13 March 2021,tkwrsvcz,6, the ending sucked,"I don't leave reviews but this movie this series was so great until the very end. Why does everything work out for harry it shouldn't. I get why they revived him in the end but this idealistic ideal that all should end perfectly is garbage. I really thought the plot armor but be removed, this movie started so amazingly then the ending. It would been so much more meaningful if they used Draco. Why? it wouldn't be hard he would say no to Voldemort and kill the snake then it would go the same until they jump out the window then they both die. Imagine the impact, harry really dead, proving Voldemort was such a challenge Harry actually had to die. Nothing felt real after they brought him back I just knew that it work out I felt nothing in the fight because I knew it was to obvious he should have died, Draco should have been redeemed. But some other problems, how selfish of Harry when he just threw away the resection stone. I don't care if Harry is going to see his family again I don't care about what happens to harry I don't care that Harry is ready I care that Ron just lost his brother that Remus's son has no father or mother and I care that Snape is dead. He could have done so much he could have thanked Snape but he didn't, he didn't think about anyone but himself just because he was okay doesn't everyone else was he forgets that other people died. When he sacrifices himself it loses all meaning when he lives again nothing he did mattered. He had everything he could have done so much good but he didn't. Also what the hell happened will Albus why? why? he knew, he learnt Ablus never cared yet he put him on the same level as Snape I accept that Snape had a weird obsession with lily but he did good with that ,he was a hero, Albus as Snape said, reared harry for death like a pig. And Harry knowing this still named his son after him, its pathetic. I would give this a two if the beginning and middle and most of the fight weren't so good the ending is absolute garbage face it Harry is selfish always has been everything, he did his treatment of everyone, its horrifying other movies had problems yes I know but those were nessicary this wasn't, this was bad, just bad just if you watch this just know the ending is bad.",

748,20 July 2011,tg62591,7, Well...,"I don't really know how to describe this movie, so I'll make use of my Spanish and say that Part II was ""asi-asi"". Yes, it is arguably the greatest saga ever told, probably the greatest I will be alive for, but as a stand-alone movie, it was mediocre. The writers/director overlooked numerous subplots from the book, and the movie felt a little impersonal. When the big battles come, and you are watching characters you fell in love with almost a decade ago meet an untimely end, you don't get very emotional like you should because it all happens so fast. Half of the heartfelt moments of the movie are basically summed up in one or two lines with melodramatic acting/writing. Not a terrible job by any of the actors, but this movie deserved a better effort all around. Not Oscar worthy in the least bit, not epic enough in the least bit, but not worth avoiding. Despite all my negative words, I do not believe this movie did harm to the Potter series, it just should have been better. I give it a 7/10 because I still enjoyed my movie going experience.",

It was a good end to the series, but seriously, to end the main time line by them holding hands and having the camera fade out? Couldn't be more cringe-worthy.
