0,8 November 2000,Anonymous_Maxine,10," One of the best films noir ever, Double Indemnity communicates with amazing effectiveness the depths of depravity, greed, lust, and betrayal of the seemingly innocent and beautiful.","This is one of the best films of all time, not necessarily because of its story but because of the acting, direction, cinematography, lighting, and just the way that the story itself was told. At the time the film was released, the idea of revealing who the killer was in the opening scene was virtually unheard of, but it ended up being very effective because it allowed the audience to concentrate more on other elements of the film, which was the goal of Billy Wilder, the director. Instead of trying to figure out who the perpetrator was, there is more emphasis on how the crime was pulled off, what mistakes were made during the murder, who betrayed who, how close Barton Keyes (the insurance investigator) was getting to solving the case, and, probably most importantly, what kind of person Walter Neff is and whether or not sympathy should be felt toward him.",/

4,2 May 2004,Spondonman,9, It fits together like a watch,"I've now seen this movie 14 times in 25 years, at all times of the year, in all moods, sober or not etc - but always at night. I recorded my copy off TV in 1987 so I can only imagine what a remaster would do for it. With an atmosphere thick enough to cut with a knife it never fails to engross and enchant me, and although it's been dated for 40 years or more still seems relevant and watchable today. TV, answer phones, recordable CD/DVD, memory sticks and the internet have all come between us and yet I can still watch Fred MacMurray speaking into a Dictaphone without a qualm. Who wears a hat in California nowadays? Who buys beer whilst driving! Lift attendants have gone but I can still believe in Charlie working and laughing away in the garage past 11 at night.",i
5,19 February 2019,jmholmes-73727,10," Movie Heaven, Baby","Barbara Stanwyck changed the trajectory of her career with her ruthless, icy performance here. Fred MacMurray, however, would never again allow himself to duplicate anything similar to Walter Neff's troubled, doomed portrayal again on screen. Playing against their dark alliance, it is left to Edward G. Robinson to win the audience over as he struggles to shed light on the insurance fraud and murder.
This script should be studied by anyone who plans to write for TV or movies. Note the significant changes Wilder and Chandler made from James Cain's original novel - changes Cain admitted were improvements.
Especially worthy of mention is the level of artistry displayed in the final minutes when, after an hour and a half of of bitter nastiness, Wilder gives us just the smallest spoonful of sugar that wraps everything up perfectly. There's almost something criminal when evil is such a treat to watch.",e
6,29 March 2006,planktonrules,9, you just can't find snappier dialog,"Wow--this movie had the absolute snappiest dialog of any Film Noir movie in Hollywood history. For dialog alone and Fred MacMurray's voice-overs, this must rank as one of the best Noir films of all time. The words they say are all so carefully chosen and magnificent--the writers really did their work well. And, the acting and direction are excellent as well. About the only reason I don't score it a 10 (and it sure came very close) was that, for Film Noir, there wasn't a whole lot of action or even suspense in the movie--considering you KNOW that MacMurray is making a confession so he isn't going to get away with the murder plot. Still, these are VERY minor complaints--the film is simply great. I suggest after seeing this film you watch an episode of MY THREE SONS and see the two extremes in Fred's work--the absolute apex and the absolute nadir (if you don't know what those words mean, look 'em up yourself, ya mug).",w

Cain virtually created a new genre with his extra-tough, sin-blackened, and sex-drenched novels--and they were so successful with the public that not even 1940s Hollywood could resist. The result was three of the most famous films of that decade: MILDRED PIERCE, THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, and DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Although POSTMAN is probably the better film, INDEMNITY is the most famous--possibly due to the story's truly psychotic edge, which is given full life by Barbara Stanwyck in one of her most celebrated performances.",/

Every time I hear Walter Neff say those words to Phyllis Dietrichson as their initial encounter concludes, I smile and settle in for another round of Double Indemnity (1944) ... one of my all-time favorites. Though I have seen it many times over the years, I recently saw it for the first time on the big screen ... and from a 35mm print! So much of the subtle filmmaking becomes apparent - the variance of lighting, the intensity of shadows, and the vividness of close-ups.

Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity revolves around an insurance fraud murder that appears foolproof until the seams start to tear. Walter Neff, the top salesman two months in a row, falls in love with the young wife of an oilman, a woman looking for a way to leave her troubled marriage. Who better to get away with the perfect crime then a man that sees false claims avenged everyday? Their tracks must be covered and their guilt assuaged. However, being as our first scene shows Walter confessing to everything, we know the well-laid plans were unsuccessful. The trick to the film becomes how it all went down, how the puzzle pieces fell into place, and the power of a conscience, eating away at you until you can't stand the pressure any longer.",9

17,11 August 2003,NewEnglandPat,8, An all-time Hollywood classic,"This film noir classic may be the best murder mystery of all time in this storied Hollywood genre. Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson are excellent but it is Barbara Stanwyck who really makes the picture come together as a woman without a moral compass. Stanwyck set the standard for tough, calculating, shady women who exploit men without shame or remorse and her masterful manipulation of MacMurray is the movie's central theme. The film's imagery is filled with shadows and low lighting, accompanied by a tense, brooding music score. Stanwyck spins her web of ensnarement like a black widow with her victim seemingly unaware of the danger that enfolds him. MacMurray provides the narrative of the film which is told in flashback and delivers a cryptic account of the events in a confession to a boss who trusted him completely. Robinson is on target as the skeptical and suspicious boss who has a sixth sense about phony insurance claims. A nice supporting cast contributes to this thriller, namely Richard Gaines and Porter Hall.",/

20,11 August 2021,nickenchuggets,10," ""We're both rotten""","Double Indemnity is considered by many to be the first movie in the noir genre, a category of films that often feature female characters who are likely to endanger the lives of men they get into relationships with. I don't really think it's true that this is the absolute first noir ever made, since Two Seconds starring Edward G Robinson was released back in the 30s and featured many of the things we associate with noir today. That's not to say Double Indemnity is unoriginal. It definitely has enough of an interesting and dangerous storyline to hold the viewer's attention constantly. The movie stars Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward Robinson in a smaller role. Even when he's not featured as prominently as the other actors, he manages to be one of the most enjoyable parts of the movie. The story is told as a flashback, which means it returns to where it started by the time the film is over. Walter Neff (MacMurray), is a man in the insurance business, and is trying to sell car insurance to people by walking into their houses and making a pitch. One day, he comes across Mr. Dietrichson and his wife, Phyllis (Stanwyck). Everything appears to go well, until sometime later when Phyllis makes some comments regarding her husband's life insurance without him knowing. This convinces Walter that she is trying to murder him, but not just that. Walter eventually becomes involved and comes up with a scheme that will invoke a ""double indemnity"" clause, which states the life insurance company will cough up more money to Barbara as compensation for Mr. Dietrichson's death. The problem is, both her and Walter have to make it look like an accident or it won't be worth it. Later on, Walter hides in the back of Phyllis' car when she is driving her husband someplace, and he kills him. Walter then pretends to be Mr. Dietrichson by using crutches to board a train and then jump off when nobody is looking, making it look like a suicide. The spot he jumps off at has Barbara waiting for him, and they promptly drag Mr. Dietrichson's real body into place. Despite the scheme just being carried out very recently, it's already causing commotion at Walter's workplace. His boss believes Dietrichson killed himself, but Keyes (Robinson) is not so sure. He ultimately comes to the conclusion that Phyllis is at least partially guilty of something, and his reasoning for this is the fact she has been seeing another man behind her husband's back. Keyes can't prove this, but it would make his whole theory come together. Meanwhile, Lola (Mr. Dietrichson's daughter) is understandably distraught by the loss of her father and starts to become a thorn in Walter's side as well. She tells him how her mother died in the care of a negligent nurse who actually turned out to be Phyllis. Because of this, she is absolutely convinced Phyllis had a hand in killing her father. With both Lola and Keyes searching left and right for clues about Phyllis being a murderer, Walter decides it's time to lay low and cuts off communications with her for a while. He's not even allowed to call her since Keyes may have sabotaged the phones. Things get worse for Walter when Keyes calls him to his office one day to meet the same exact person who saw him jump off the train the night he pretended to commit suicide, although the witness doesn't recognize him. Once cleared of suspicion, Walter goes to Phyllis' house to tell her they are through. He also says he knows she is seeing another man behind his back. Phyllis shoots him, but Walter survives and feigns attraction toward her, allowing him to shoot her as they hug each other. Back at his office, Walter starts talking into a dictaphone (which is how the movie begins), and Keyes shows up to call the police on him. This is a great movie. The plot is not very complex once you realize it's essentially about Phyllis trying to get money from the death of her husband, but there's so many twists throughout that it seems complicated. Unexpected turns in the story are one of the things that define noir movies, and there's a lot of that on offer here. The great music composed by the Hungarian Miklos Rozsa is one of the best aspects of this film, since it is very dramatic and fitting for the constant conspiring Double Indemnity has. The dialogue is smartly written and the cast of characters are memorable, mainly since there are not many of them. Fred MacMurray plays Walter very well, accurately depicting his frustration (and excitement) as he is drawn deeper and deeper into an illegal scheme with his female acquaintance. Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis acts as both a friend and later a rival to Walter, the latter becoming more visible as the film goes on. At first, she looks up to him as a beacon of hope who is capable of liberating her from her bleak life with an abusive husband. Later on, Walter claims his boss knows too much about their scheme and must abandon it, making her incandescent with rage. You can't forget Robinson either. Even though he's a lesser character in this movie, he appears consistently throughout many of its scenes. He's the one that takes the initiative when it comes to proving Phyllis caused the death of her husband to collect insurance money. Perfect writing, great characters, an interesting story, fitting and dramatic music, and all released to audiences before noir was really a genre. There are many reasons why Double Indemnity can be called one of the best noirs ever made, but these are the ones I chose.",e

Barbara Stanwyck is a knockout as the classic femme fatale, complete with cheap blonde wig and ankle bracelets.

The quick fire dialogue and superb repartee are so engaging that they command the attention of the audience right from the start and also provide added impetus to all the action that follows. Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler collaborated in adapting James M Cain's story for the movie and the end result was nothing short of brilliant and was understandably nominated for the Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay in 1945.",t
26,9 May 2011,dataconflossmoor,10, Collusion with Angora,"In 1943, director of the film, ""Double Indemnity"", Billy Wilder, was painstakingly determined to complete a motion picture about this compelling novel written by James M. Cain. Cain is known for other great novels such as ""Mildred Pierce"" and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"". In the process of creating this major motion picture, several actors, including George Raft and Alan Ladd, turned down the job as the sinister leading male role in this movie. Finally, the part was offered to squeaky clean, Fred MacMurray, this appointment is literally, out of character for MacMurray! Barbara Stanwyck received the honor for the lead female role in ""Double Indemnity"", and Edward G Robinson was given the third billing as a star in this picture. This post of third billing was something that had not happened to Edward G Robinson since his prior acting days before ""Little Caeser"", which was made in 1931. Robinson capitulated to a third billing spot because he had a great admiration for the concept that the film ""Double Indemnity"" so intricately purported! The whole genre to ""Double Indemnity"" was set up flawlessly, as it orchestrated a deliberately contradictory dynamic. Behind the sunny pleasantry of Los Angeles, there lurked a deep rooted and conniving chicanery amidst a couple of masterminds who began implementing a horribly dark aspect of human behavior. The film, ""Double Indemnity"" manifested the rough exterior that the United Staes was besieged with because of their involvement in World War II. The American movie goer had become a little less naive since the advent of WWII, and, this reflected itself accordingly with regards to the type of movie they wanted to see. The film noir captivated the American public, and, now, the movie industry encompassed a myriad of wry depictions that were germane to the pejorative side of an individual. This dubiously sensationalistic technique by the motion picture industry was perceived as intriguing by the newly enlightened movie audience of the early 1940's!! The film ""Double Indemnity"" epitomizes the entire film noir pique, right alongside with the uncanny masterpiece ""Maltese Falcon"". ""Double Indemnity"" did not win for best picture in 1944, that year, the Academy Award was given to ""Going My Way"". As we all know, there are times when life simply does not make any sense, especially since a prominent Philadelphia critic rated ""Going My Way"" the worst Academy Award winning film in the whole history of the American cinema! ""Double Indemnity"" is considered to be Billy Wilder's best directing effort! The next year, Billy Wilder's directorial ability was totally vindicated, as he received his rightfully deserved acclaim with the film, ""The Lost Weekend"", which won for best picture in 1945. Billy Wilder received the Academy Award for best director that year as well. The film, ""Double Indemnity"" is truly remarkable!! The itemized and avaricious intensity to this movie was something that had not been depicted in films before the movie ""Double Indemnity"" was made. This film's wiles of malice and deceit were not expedited with a derivative and visceral disposition, rather, these antics were carried off with a dedicated fervor and paramount gratification. Fred MacMurray's character was perpetually afflicted with a relentless angst that infiltrated an acrimonious reveille to him about the primary repercussions of personal greed! His character, Walter Neff, endured a narrative agony which perpetuated a compulsive pontification about how people really are, as opposed to the way they are suppose to be! Barbara Stanwyck established her formidable status as a revolutionary femme-fatal in the Hollywood world of movies, with her performance in ""Double Indemnity"". Charismatically charming while wearing her diverse onslaught of angora sweaters, her beauty and allure became a necessary ingredient to the making of this film! The wig that Barbara Stanwyck wore for this movie, signified the overall mendacity to her heinously lethal and obsessive persona!! Stanwyck's intellectual ambiguity to this role was attributed to her overtly callous set of pecuniary priorities! Edward G. Robinson's character was the perennial voice of reason. Robinson was the legal eagle who would ultimately prevail in his tenacious quest to resolve all of these dubiously manufactured and felonious escapades! The final scene with MacMurray and Stanwyck was an all-time noir classic. This last scene with MacMurray and Stanwyck was one of the best scenes of any movie whatsoever, definitely head to head with the extraordinary last scene of the movie ""The Killing"". A respected production company ranks this ending the sixth best ending of any and all movies ever produced! The dramatic ending to ""Double Indemnity"" was rated right above ""Casablanca"" and right below ""City Lights"". The heightened glamor to the final scene for MacMurray and Stanwyck exuded a zenith within the realm of the classic film noir mystique. The emphatic, yet subtle, overtone to the song ""Tangerine"" playing in the background, became a melodic element to this final scene which was conducive to a sexually sedate form of apocalyptic doom and despair! Throughout the entire duration of this movie, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck were always seducing each other with salacious innuendos! This ending wound up emulating a philosophical perspective used by writers of ancient Greek tragedies! Filming a movie in black and white is primarily advantageous to the quality of a film, as it obviates any disorientation to the impact of the characters' emotions!! AFI (AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE) ranks ""Double Indemnity"" the 29th best film out of the top 100 American movies ever made! This website ranks ""Double Indemnity"" 53rd out of the top 250 films ever produced. Last, but certainly not least, America's Writer's Guild East, ranks ""Double Indemnity"" the 26th best written script ever in the history of American films!! The director, Billy Wilder, does a tremendous job with consummating the aggregate megalomania and rancor to this movie. The acting was sensational. ""Double Indemnity"" was up for seven Academy Awards in 1944! Without question! ""Double Indemnity"" is one of the greatest films ever created... FIVE STARS... PERFECT TEN!!!!",_
27,30 January 2014,Tweekums,10, Classic Film Noir,As this classic film noir begins protagonist Walter Neff returns to the insurance office he works at; it is late at night and he is clearly injured. He sits down and starts to record a confession; he starts by saying that he had helped a woman kill her husband for the insurance money. The action then flashes back and we see the events from the moment of his first meeting with femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson when he flirts with her while visiting to remind her that her husband's car insurance needs renewing. On their second meeting she brings up the idea of taking out accident insurance without her husband knowing he knows she is talking about murder and walks out but inevitably they meet again and start to plan how they could do it. Walter decides it must be done on a train as a clause in the policy doubles the payout of course with that sort of payout the company will investigate very closely and Walter's friend Barton Keyes always figures out what happened.,u

I've never liked movies that go back in time because I've never been able to forget the beginning that has pretty much ruined the ending.

Though ""Sunset Boulevard"" is a great movie, it has a few script holes that ""Double Indemnity"" does not have. For example, in ""Double Indemnity,"" Walter Neff admits at the beginning of the movie that he has killed a man. He does this by dictating into a machine. He then proceeds to tell how it happened. This could very likely take place in the real world. In ""Sunset boulevard"" a corpse is floating in a pool; the corpse begins through narration to tell how it ended up dead. This is a major flaw since dead people don't tell tales.",

32,2 August 2016,JLRMovieReviews,10, Stanwyck MacMurray and Robinson Shine in Wilder Classic!,"Barbara Stanwyck is unhappily married but not helpless in this hypnotic Billy Wilder film classic, ""Double Indemnity,"" based on the James Cain novel. Stanwyck is hardly ever helpless. She plays the quintessential femme-fatale, as she seduces insurance salesman Fred MacMurray into her web and entices him to kill for her. The target is her husband. That's all you really need to know. But why am I reviewing this with so many reviews already? #1: To be among the masses who say and agree that this is arguably the best film noir ever, and #2 : To sing the praises of Edward G. Robinson! Many people will invest a lot of time in Billy Wilder's stylized technique of movie-making and his attention of each minute detail and the incredible dialogue and script, co-written by Raymand Chandler, and perhaps Fred MacMurray's best performance on screen, but while all this is true and all these factors come together to make a perfect film. One of the biggest factors is Edward's contribution to this film. The words on the page burst forth, when Edward says them. His tirades about death statistics bring life and breath to the film in contrast to the other two, who are somberly serious and only thinking about how to get out their problems alive! The balance of ""hammy"" Edward and his outbursts conveying joy, revelation, frustration and feeling about his job and his ""little man"" and ""Papa,"" solving each mystery, along with the walking dead characters make for a mesmerizing movie experience. I have praised the always professional and exceptional Stanwyck before in other reviews. To go on any further with anything would be redundant; this is Billy Wilder and his cast's finest hour.",

34,2 December 2006,FilmFanatic09,8, Double Indemnity,"From the first time he sees that ankle bracelet, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a doomed man. As Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) descends her California home's spiral staircase, we are as enraptured as Neff. And it takes little time to figure out that being enraptured by this femme fatale is a very dangerous position to find oneself in. Is it accidental that the bracelet is worn around her ankle, as opposed to the more traditional wrist? Is it accidental that the sunlight streaming through the windows cast shadows not unlike bars across the living room? I suspect it's about as accidental as Mr. Dietrichson (Tom Powers) eventually ending up dead along the railroad tracks. We must remember that Billy Wilder is doing more than evoking noir here, he's inventing it. And how brave he is! Beginning the film by all but divulging the ending is hardly the route most directors choose to go when directing a thriller. But as he's well aware, the audience doesn't care half as much about where they end up as they do about the thrill of the ride it takes to get them there. ",

In other words, another potboiler. But as much as I wanted to, I couldn't find anything wrong with this movie! This movie is terrific!

But the real star is Edward G. Robinson. His performance as the the insurance actuary Walter Neff is incredible. How many movies are there that portrays an office bureaucrat as a hero? That is what makes this movie so unique. This movie is a tribute to all the office workers of the world who push the papers, compile the facts, analyze the information and keep things going.

The acting is in top form from all of the players.  The cinematography is crisp, and beautiful.  The sound is nice and clear, and the direction is arguably some of Wilder's best.  However, the real star is the screenplay.  First off, it was taken from excellent source material.  James Cain is always great for a story where nobody wins out.  Check out The Postman Always Rings Twice for an example.  But it is Chandler who I think really put this one on the map. Chandler has a way with dialogue that makes it all ring in your ears.  The lines are smooth, and the characters always say something that makes me wish I could be that clever and smooth in everyday situations.  Chandler knows dialogue, Chandler knows LA, and Chandler knows how to deliver a story. Check out any of his novels, and you will see this.

Think Bette Davis or other minxes who got their own ways. MacMurray and Stanwyck cook up a plot to get some insurance money in a double indemnity situation, where the right kind of situation results in double the money. Sometimes the characters are so full of themselves that they can't see the forest for the trees. What does Fred offer this lady; is she so bent on giving him what she wants.

That silly idea that films are intellectual stimulants and movies are just trash pumped up in a way that comes across as giddy.

I have previously noted that Barbara Stanwyck seems a little lacking in this department, despite the odd alluring glance. But it is Fred MacMurray I noticed on this viewing rather unconvincing. Then it occurred to me that we are so used to thinking of Stanwyck's character (maybe even her) as being rather cold and calculating, that we do not notice the similar position of MacMurray. He even says at some point (to himself probably) that he is keen to see if he can beat his own company, more specifically his rather close chum, here played immaculately by Edward G Robinson. Even though this is all told in flashback and much of it in voice over, it is hard to criticise a frame of this remarkable movie of greed, power and deceit. Even though the origin is a Cain short story, Billy Wilder and more significantly, Raymond Chandler have crafted the script and the combination of talents managed to produce a sharp and witty dialogue driven film that can be watched so many times.",

The post hoc framing, providing narration to one degree or another that often directly addresses someone; the shadow and/or calculated lighting; the smart, snappy dialogue: whether one wishes to see this as a progenitor of the style, or just a preeminent example, there's no arguing that 'Double indemnity' is a classic.

The two begin an affair and hatch an ingenious plot to sell life insurance to Phyllis's husband and then to murder him for the money.

He pushed the envelope three major times in his career, this being the first one. By casting Barbara Stanwyck, arguably the biggest female star of the time, and Fred MacMurray, who was known at the time for doing family-type comedy, as two lovers who commit murder to get money, he created a new standard in casting as well as making the definitive film noir. It may not be the best one, but it's up there and the reason, in this critic's opinion, belongs to MacMurray. He is so good in every scene, whether he is flirting, murdering, or simply narrating, he convinces you all the way and makes you wish that he hadn't made the mistake of going to the Dietrichson house that sunny afternoon. Stanwyck is devilish as the femme fatale and Edward G. Robinson is so smooth as a fast-talking, intelligent insurance claims adjuster who lets nothing get in his way from solving a mysterious case.

Based on the novel by James M Cain, the film follows insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) who finds himself seduced by the wife of one of his wealthier clients; the beautiful, but cunning Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbra Stanwyck). Phyllis is the classic femme fatale; she perpetuates an innocent facade, but beneath this she is a master manipulator, and she convinces Walter to assist her in murdering her husband. The pair conspire to portray Mr Dietrichson's death as an accident in order to receive a hefty insurance payout, which will be doubled if Dietrichson dies in what is considered to be a rare or unusual way, such as by a collision with a train. Walter's insurance experience enables him to plot the murder seamlessly, but his boss, Barton Keyes (Edward G Robinson), has a knack for sniffing out bogus claims, and it is not long before he starts to have suspicions about the death of Mr Dietrichson.",

'Double Indemnity' has all the tropes and clichés that became an integral part of the subsequent films of the aforementioned genre. It has the shady and morally crooked characters, the voice-over narration, the seductive and vicious femme fatale, a gloomy look and cinematography which involves a constant attention to the use of shadows and darkness. No one can ever deny how influential a film 'Double Indemnity' is. One has to only see the number of remakes and rip- offs that have been made of it to grasp its legacy.",

In an effort to rid herself of her allegedly abusive ex-husband, a woman strikes up a romance with an insurance salesman who just happens upon her doorstep with some auto insurance renewals. Since it's not enough to get out of her marriage without financial security, she enlists the salesman to not only commit fraud by having the cuckolded husband sign a life insurance policy with a double indemnity clause without any knowledge of doing so, but also to help her bump off her husband by making it look like an accident. Unfortunately, paranoia and conscience tends to get in the way in situations like these, and even something that seems to be a ""perfect murder"" can go sour, fast. This is the plot of Billy Wilder's celebrated 1944 noir masterpiece, ""Double Indemnity"", in which Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck) and Walter Neff (MacMurray) find themselves embroiled in a situation that at the time, seemed like a good one, until they end up way over their heads; mainly due to their lack of trust in each other.

Robinson) to nail would-be fraudsters, rather than close liaison work with the LAPD. As this story progresses, you may not be able to help shouting at the screen, ""where are the fingerprints?!; where is the video-surveillance footage?!; who has cell phone pictures?; where is the fiber evidence?!; why haven't they sent the victim's clothes to ""trace"" to check for DNA evidence?!; why haven't they ordered a psychological autopsy?; why hasn't the ""grieving widow"" been hooked up to a lie detector machine yet?!; etc.; etc.;""--and then you'll probably realize the picture is black and white because this is all taking place in the 1930s. (Then you might start wondering why EVERYONE wasn't rubbed out for their insurance benefit back then, since this sort of crime looks so much easier to get away with than it would be today.) The bottom line is this movie, as scripted, cast, and directed, is riveting (and probably would be if it were set in 1848).

Billy Wilder seems totally uninterested in the human condition, only in spinning his banal tale of insurance fraud. Does anybody really care about the policy? that it pays out double in certain circumstances? or do we just want to open a window to get some fresh air after it's over?
Robinson is just about perfect as the investigator with a little man inside him; Stanwyck, despite an ugly wig, delivers her lines with a silky and vicious smoothness that's very effective; Macmurray looks the part--we believe he could be a decent guy at heart who gets lost in a woman's treachery--but delivers his lines too fast, no doubt at Wilder's request.",

It was a one of a kind film experience, one that has remained an undeniable classic for some time. Though elements of film noir have been duplicated from time to time in modern films, such as Sin City and the animated film Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, the original films are simply a band apart. Film noir most specifically represented a time of change in American history. At a time when World War II was awakening people to the horrors men were capable of, and the perfect picture was that of that of the suburban family, film noir was almost a shadow cast by those things. The genre was an exposure of the blackness of the human soul. Housewives and insurance salesman, ordinary people that committed heinous crimes for the hunger of sex and money, not uncommonly both. Not to mention due to the censorship code being in full effect, the writers and filmmakers had to be subtle about their subject, and what it lead to was sharp characterization that didn't use just words.

153,29 November 2001,bmacv,10," Unquestionably the greatest noir, and one of the greatest American movies","Double Indemnity is the crown jewel of the entire film noir cycle, its black sapphire.  The project started with the fervid plotting and prose of James M. Cain's shocker (one of his three novels, including Mildred Pierce and The Postman Always Rings Twice, which supplied material for three key films of the 1940s).  Director Billy Wilder and the formidable Raymond Chandler (taking a well-remunerated break from his Philip Marlowe books) labored unhappily only to give birth to a hard and glittering masterpiece of a screenplay. Wilder then filmed it with breathtaking panache.  The story's brew of adultery, murder and duplicity was a slap in the face to wartime audiences, content with supping upon optimistic, sentimental cinematic fare. Barbara Stanwyck abandoned women's weepers and screwball romps to don an anklet and create Phyllis Dietrichson, the coldest and deadliest of the cycle's femmes fatales;  she delivers an unforgettable, sensational performance, never surpassed even by her later outings as Martha Ivers, Thelma Jordon and Mae Doyle D'Amato (in Clash by Night).  As intrepid insurance investigator Barton Keyes, Edward G. Robinson is at his wry and crafty best, serving to puncture the unrelievedly heavy and suffocating textures of the film.  The surprise is amiable, dull Fred MacMurray who is just perfect as the way-out-of-his-depth bachelor whose downfall is thinking with his zipper.  Double Indemnity is one film noir whose vision is not compromised by parsimonious budgets, a recycled and warmed-over script, sub-par casting or by-the-numbers direction; for once, everything works right, and the upshot is one of the greatest, if darkest, movies ever made in America.",

Wilder's 1945 ""The Lost Weekend"" in particular is as harrowing and relevant today as it was in 1945, and deservedly won the Oscar for Best Picture. Stanwyck, who I found very sexy in other movies (Ball of Fire, e.g) doesn't do a thing for me in this film, not the least because of the ridiculous blonde wig or whatever she had on her head. The scenes in the supermarket and in the back of the train where MacMurray never faces the stranger who offers to get a pack of cigarettes, are very clumsily done. The side stories of the daughter and her boyfriend also don't help. The ending, however, is still very effective today,as are many scenes, most of them involving Edward G. Robinson, who's excellent.

But through a lot of the hype surrounding the picture, it would be one thing if it had all of these qualities and then ended up being not too interesting.

A cigar-smoking Edward G. Robinson of ""Little Caesar"" is just as effective when they aren't on screen as the hero's superior of sorts. Robinson qualifies as the chief adversity because our hero and heroine are the conspirators in the murder case. Legendary whodunit novelist Raymond Chandler of Philip Marlowe fame adapted James Cain's gritty account about a murder most foul. The dialogue is juicy stuff with a pervasive sense of irony. Basically, a well-heeled insurance agent, Pacific Risk Insurance Agent Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray of ""The Apartment""), and the glamorous young wife of a recent widower plot the death of her husband. Phyllis Dietrichson wants to do away with her husband because he cries foul each time she drops his money on her wardrobe. The indignant husband cannot understand why a woman in California would need a hat. Phyllis confides her lack of marital bliss in Walter during one of his visits at the Dietrichson residence and utters nothing positive about her husband and his daughter from his previous marriage. Matters get out of hand when Walter sells Phyllis a double indemnity policy on her husband without his knowledge. Walter fools him into signing what is a copy of his auto policy. The sizzling romance between the two premeditated killers and Stanwyck's rampant sexuality make ""Double Indemnity"" a memorable movie. Our misguided hero knows that he wants this devious dame from the moment he spots her anklet as she trots down the stairs. The only thing contrived about this outstanding epic is the way that Walter's apartment door opens out into the corridor instead of vice-versa. The door opening the wrong way is key to a scene when Phyllis tries to visit Walter after they have murdered her husband. Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) makes an unexpected appearance at Walter's apartment after Phyllis has told Walter that she is sneaking over to see him. Despite its flashback conceit with Walter Neff recording his murderous exploits on Keyes' Dictaphone, ""Double Indemnity"" is a slick, calculated thriller. Incredibly, nobody noticed until post-production that MacMurray was still wearing his wedding band. The character of Walter Neff is a single man who lives alone by himself. Wilder stages the death of the husband while the killers are transporting the husband to the train depot. Neff has concealed himself behind the front seat and waits patiently for the moment to throttle Mr. Dietrichson. When he kills the husband, Wilder keeps the camera aimed on the impassive Phyllis. ""Double Indemnity"" has several chilling moments. People turn up at the worst time imaginable when the killers show up at the train depot. Wilder plays things pretty seriously except for some of the smart aleck dialogue and a scene in the insurance owner's office when he makes a buffoon out of himself. Predictably, things unravel for everybody at the end. Cain was a popular crime novelist when ""Double Indemnity"" came out. He wrote what later became the Joan Crawford masterpiece ""Mildred Pierce."" He also penned the steamy, sordid novel ""The Postman Always Rings Twice."" All three are exceptional films, and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" is the best. Nevertheless, if you haven't seen ""Double Indemnity, you've missed a classic.",

In the film, the dark variant found its true form: people were dissatisfied and unheroic. Double Indemnity, and just almost every noir after it, was characterized by sadistic and brutal cultural behavior or; the complete lack of behavior. In this interpretation a clear difference was made to more romantic noirs, such as Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep (1946). The genre is both unlimited and connected; it is hard to draw the line between dark films and films that are ""film-noir"" but crime is a thing that unites them all -- it is a necessity of some kind -- it is a prism through which we can observe life as it is, ahead of all the illusions.",

Not stopping until he unravels the crime, mind full of statistics and possible scenarios, and trusting no-one, every scene he is in, is a classic. although i haven't read the book, i have read much other Noir, and while this is nowhere near as violent or erotic as those, it retains their atmosphere, and the feel of the period. 9 out of 10",

Even the mistakes are well known: The door that opens in the wrong direction; Fred MacMurray's wedding ring and his reference to ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940). (This film purports to take place in 1938); Barbara Stanwyck's blonde wig, etc. Less talked about is the sad irony that, unbeknown to Billy Wilder at the time, his mother perished in the Krakow-Plaszow concentration camp while he was making this film. ""Double Indemnity's"" depraved characters and their cruel machinations somewhat echo on a vastly smaller scale what was then going on in Europe. The film marks a high point in the careers of the three main actors, especially Stanwyck, who set a benchmark for femmes fatales that has never been topped.",

And then the flashback begins and we spend the rest of the film seeing how it is we got to that ending we already know. It would seem that under these circumstances there may not be much drama or tension in the film but that could not be further from the truth. We may know the film's ultimate destination but the journey never fails to be compelling. It is fascinating to watch this classic film noir story unfold.

Director/writer Billy Wilder, assisted by established novelist Raymond Chandler with the screenplay, knows how to do it. He presents his film noir entirely in flashbacks, narrated in atmospheric voice-overs leading eventually to what we've already seen in the introduction. And despite the fact that we know where it's all heading we're still glued to our seats. New at the time and often copied ever since, but rarely done that well.",

187,2 September 2005,angilee-1,10, I watch this movie every time I see it on!,"Barbara Stanwyck was in her late thirties when she played Phyllis, and wore a wig, but she looks every inch the seductive femme fatal. The only flaw I personally see in this film is the fact that Neff starts to fall for the immature stepdaughter, who is so daffy she already has a boyfriend that treats her like dirt. Phyllis's husband is also not the kind of guy that garners your compassion, even when they kill him. Although they don't show how Neff actually kills the husband from the backseat, or talk about it, it seem plausible that Neff broke his neck. After all, a knife wound would rule out the possibility of an accident, and there was no gun shot. I grew up in Glendale, Ca. and several scenes in this film were shot in the the same town in the 40's. Not everything has changed all that much geographically. I love old movies that show LA as it was. The obvious father/son relationship between Neff and Edward G. Robinson makes it so much more exciting. It's amazing that Robinson's character, who is so quick to feel the ""little man"" in his stomach when anything is wrong, would fail to notice the character flaws in Neff, even before the murder. I guess Phyllis just brought out the underlying dormant evil that was always in Neff. But her evil was never dormant, up until the moment when Neff has a gun at her chest and she tells him she couldn't pull the trigger on her own gun again to finish him off. Too late now, ""lady""...",

Hell, the film itself hardly cares about them! We learn the score from the get-go, when Walter recites his confession into a Dictaphone: ""I killed him for money and for a woman. I didn't get the money, and I didn't get the woman."" So much for last-act revelations!

189,9 December 2018,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,8, The very definition of film-noir.,"This a true classic, directed by Billy Wilder and staring Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and the giant of the silver screen, Edward G. Robinson. ''Double Indemnity'' is based on a novel by James M. Cain who also wrote the script of the movie with one of the legends of American hard-boiled crime fiction, Raymond Chandler. The film has all the necessary ingredients of a classic noir story, a damsel in distress, Philys who plots her husband's murder along with Walter, an insurance salesman who convinces her to commit the murder in a way that will make them also rich by taking the accidental death insurance money from Walter's firm. But they are not in luck as the claims man of the firm, Keys, is a brilliant investigator with a killer-hunch who soon becomes suspicious of the incident and manages to finally work it out. The plotline is reminiscent of another J. M. Caine's novel which was also adapted for the big screen, ''The Postman Always Rings Twice'' and keeps the viewer glued to the screen. The acting is impeccable with E. G. Robinson in the role of Poirot-like claims man with an abundance of active grey cells who always finds out the truth behind dubious incidents. If you still haven't seen this masterpiece, it is time to take a seat and devour one of the legendary films of the genre.",

This is the penultimate film noir, but with Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler collaborating on the script I would expect nothing less. Barbara Stanwyck is perfect; you can just see her calculating and planning in those first few meetings with MacMurray, who is no slouch himself. I don't think he ever calls her by her first name, constantly calling her ""baby,"" while giving a great example of a man bored with his career and excited by a challenge and a hot dame. Edward G. Robinson is fabulous too. I was amazed by that suicide statistics speech! I don't think Miklos Rozsa's perfect score gets enough credit for creating the mood of this picture. It's so wonderfully foreboding, getting us ready for the cool, hardened crime drama that those first few notes and shots promise us.

That can certainly be said for Fred MacMurray, who could do a great job in films as diverse as ""The Egg And I"", ""The Miracle Of The Bells"", ""The Caine Mutiny"", and this film. Comedy, melodrama, war, and film noir -- all done quite nicely.

The acting is not, contrary to popular opinion, that good. The main characters were not so hot, the best piece of acting was actually the portrayal of Keys, his character was almost Holmes-esque. The plot is very generic. Of course, this film may well have been one of the first to carry out such a plot, it may have been a real trend-setter, but I'm sorry that doesn't make it a classic by any stretch of the imagination.

200,4 March 2022,Philipp_Flersheim,9, Outstanding film-noir,"'Double Indemnity' is by a good margin the most impressive film-noir I have so far watched. The plot is excellent and logical from start to finish: An insurance agent (Fred MacMurray in one of his best roles) teams up with a femme fatal (played by Barbara Stanwyck) to murder her husband and cash in on the insurance premium. The plan looks flawless but of course there is one snag that the two have overlooked and that the agent's older colleague (Edward G. Robinson) notices - with fatal results. All the characters are multi-layered and interesting. MacMurray plays the hard-boiled man of action who thinks of everything, but is in fact a smarmy weakling; Barbara Stanwyck initially seems to be no more than an unloved wife - as lonesome as she is lovely - but over time turns out to be as cold-blooded as she is ruthless. Robinson is a kind of father figure for McMurray. It is evident that McMurray admires his acumen as an insurance man with a nose for attempts to commit fraud, and it seems likely he develops the murder plan with the idea in the back of his mind to impress his older colleague. The acting is excellent and the dialogue unsurpassed. From today, this is one of my favourite films.",

209,25 June 2007,jboothmillard,7, Double Indemnity,"One reason I wanted to see this film was because it was directed and written by Oscar nominated Billy Wilder (Some Like It Hot), another reason is because it is a film noir, and Femme Fetale (aka attractive woman seducing men), and it becomes a crime partnership or something) film, and many people have recommended it. Basically smooth talking insurance agent Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is confessing his story to his best and suspecting friend, detective Barton Keyes (Little Caesar's Edward G. Robinson). Walter met attractive Phyllis Dietrichson (Oscar nominated Barbara Stanwyck) calling to renew the automobile policy for her husband, Mr. Dietrichson (Tom Powers). The pair become very close, and eventually they plot to kill the husband, who is tricked into signing a double indemnity accident policy (i.e. Phyllis gets cash if he dies), and they kill him to look like an accident. Barton doesn't believe it was an accident, and links the murder to Phyllis, and never to his best friend. Walter meanwhile believes Phyllis has dumped him for a younger man, and he ends up stabbing her in the end. Also starring Porter Hall as Mr. Jackson, Jean Heather as Lola Dietrichson and Byron Barr as Nino Zachetti. I can see why the critics gave it five stars, and it is definitely not one to miss, and Stanwyck's character is a true bitch, but it is one of those classics I don't want to see much, but it is very good. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Music for Miklós Rózsa, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture.

Fred MacMurray... not the first choice or the most obvious, but he turns in the best performance of his entire career in this one. Much has been said about Barbara Stanwyck's much hated cheap blonde wig but I saw it as a young man and thought nothing about it until I starting reading these things about it. Still doesn't bother me at all. Edward G. is perfectly cast as the brainy hero-guy who is also MacMurray's workaholic boss.
 I must say I have grown to appreciate Billy Wilders films much more in the last few years with the release of his works being released on blu ray format. His witty/satirist writing still holds up decades later and should be studied by writing students. The cinematography is in glorious B&W and uses for the most part real L.A. locations which I have always found better anyway.

A key role (no pun intended) was the insurance investigator, Barton Keyes. Wilder convinced screen legend Edward G. Robinson to take a supporting role. This was Oscar's first big mistake. Not only did Robinson not win an Academy Award, he was not even nominated. (They gave it to Barry Fitgerald playing himself in ""Going My Way"" -- one of the worst calls in Oscar history.) Fred McMurray, who gave one of his two greatest performances as Walter Neff ( the other was for his role as a womanizing heel in another Billy Wilder masterpiece, ""The Apartment"") was also completely overlooked. He also had to be convinced to take a role against type. Barbara Stanwyck as the ultimate femme fatale, was at least nominated but passed over for the forth and final time.

233,10 July 2007,boomerchinde,10, Top notch insurance fraud and murder noir,"A Billy Wilder masterpiece. Film noir at its finest. Insurance agent Fred MacMurray portrays a poor sap soaked into Barbara Stanwyck's desire for her hubby's demise. Together they plan the perfect murder, but alas, they have crafty old Edward G. Robinson to contend with. How can a film with this director and these stars miss? Simple, it can't and it doesn't. The casting of MacMurray as a murderer is a stroke of genius -- take a star who staked his career on good guy roles and show his vulnerability. Terrific performance by Stanwyck, who always holds her own up against any other actor in the business, but even so, it's a 3 way tie for kudos on this one. Beautifully paced, this story of lust and greed practically mirrors ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", but stands tall all by itself. John Seitz makes great use of his camera, blending shadow and light to perfectly examine the motives of the characters and the movie's mood. Based on a James Cain novel, this film was forced to change its ending as it was deemed too graphic for 1940's viewers. MacMurray's narration throughout sparkles, and this movie works because it has a conscience in the form of Robinson. Simply great.",

It's the blind purpose of alienating other people just for the sake of sacrificing for one person. Manipulation, lust, ignorance. 'Double Indemnity' is all these things that play a part in blindly ""falling in love"" with someone, without knowing that person is acting purely on lustful desires. Once the movie begins and we are introduced to our main character, we are already aware things have taken a bad turn, but we just don't know how bad.

This film certainly was fodder for a Carol Burnett parody, if for nothing else, her hair. The only believable character I found was that of Lola, the victim's daughter. Edward G. Robinson was great, thus I felt that the part was written for him. Now the part of the casual observer on the train from Oregon seemed to be terribly stereotyped, and the racist overtones as with Mr. Galopus and the ""colored woman who comes in twice a week"" didn't excite me either, but I guess that was what it was like in those days.",

Stanwyck smolders in the role of the disaffected housewife who sees MacMurray as a means of ridding herself of a husband and reaping the financial rewards. EG Robinson shines as the insurance investigator but it is MacMurray who steals the movie. One has no trouble in believing him in the role of an opportunistic killer. Who would have thought that the doting father of My Three Sons could be so sinister. MacMurray should have won the Oscar for his coruscating performance.

Granted, this was made in the 40's so some turns of phrase seem a bit pompous or outdated, but lines fly and follow each other with a remarkable fluidity, without any downs. As for the rest, the movie comprises every characteristic of the film noir genre whether on the form or content, from lighting to the voice-over or the typical characters. The plot is implacable but some elements are not very credible, like the emerging romance for example. The Machiavellian scheme and the investigation that follows it lack suspense, tension, and the outcome turns out to be a bit disappointing because it's rather telegraphed although it perfectly concludes this noir which probably remains Wilder's most iconic.",

It's your prototypical noir film, from its intense score to it's over the top dialog right down to the insurance salesman protagonist? Not what I would have expected, but to each their own. I liked Double Indemnity, but I'm bias because I love noir films. The lightning in this film wasn't quite as high contrast as I enjoy, while there was obvious separation of light and dark, it wasn't as extreme as some other films thus the tension wasn't quite there in some of the crucial scenes. I won't say that there isn't any contrasting lighting, just not as extreme as I tend to like from my noir films. This is to be expected however with this being an early noir films that inspired latter films I prefer. I'm sure that the content of this film was considered to be incredibly taboo at the time, but for modern audiences it's fairly tame. This being pre-code Hollywood prevents anything from getting too scandalous, but it's interesting to see how they worked around it.

It's moody yet playful, with a brilliantly penned screenplay that provides a quip for every situation. A steady mix of non-linear storytelling, ambiguous motives, dense black-and-white cinematography and now archetypal characters marks this as one of the prime examples of its genre.

For what I thought film noir to be, it was pretty much as I imagined. There were higher contrasted scenes and shots of characters shadows and things. Not throughout the whole thing, in day time shots, but it was still there. But it did seem like that whole stereotypical noir feeling with the narrating by the main character.

It features a script by Raymond Chandler, and direction by Billy Wilder: you couldn't get much better than this in the 1940s. In it's favour, it's nicely paced with some sharp wise-cracking dialogue, and Edward G. Robinson is fun in a supporting role. Against that, it rather leads its audience by the nose, with a voice-over telling where it would have been better to simply show. This puts a distance between us and the film, which doesn't spoil the tricksy plotting but which does rather kill the movie's emotional dimension. For sure, it feels its age; but the film's redeeming virtue is in its genuine interest in telling its story, something you feel more modern films, art-house and blockbuster alike, often seem to lack.",

The woman in this film (Phyllis) is a classic woman figure in a film noir film in the sense that she is not who she appears to be. She comes off as an average woman but secretly wants her husband dead. The plot is very eery and dark with Phyllis being the center of evil. This film utilizes many other aspects of the overall film noir genre. Low key lighting is seen throughout the film as well as oppressive music which gives the pessimistic feel which is seen in many other film noir films. Even the costumes the characters wear help with its overall feel. The men are seen wearing gangster type suits while the women are well dressed in dresses.

The masterful use of flashbacks to tell most of the story was similar to that of Mildred Pierce, but there were plenty of differences. Editing was crucial in this film just to pull off the easy transition from reality to flashback. The story itself was easy and interesting to follow. Shadows played a big role in portraying a character, hard shadows for intense characters and soft shadows for more lax characters. The mes-en-scene, or feel of the movie, was interesting.

279,9 May 2014,m-visker,8, Double Indemnity,"This movie is considered by some the first film noir, it touches on all the key aspects that a film noir has, the alienated main character: Walter the normal insurance salesman, femme fatal: Phyllis the seductive but evil wife who is able to convince Walter to help her kill her husband, and redemption in the end. Along with these characteristics they way the movie is film, for example low key light that causes a lot of shadows and angular camera shots. Double Indemnity has a lot of great scenes that really tell you a lot about the characters with out having to say anything, and just let the way it is edited to give you the information. One scene that is a good example of this when Phyllis and Walter first meet, Phyllis is on a balcony looking out and the camera angle is low to high, because Walter is looking up at her. Having the camera angle from low to high gives us the impression that Phyllis is in powered and we are already clued in on who will be the dominant one in the duo. Another great example of this is the scene where Phyllis is driving her husband. We already know Walter is in the back seat waiting to murder her husband, and when he does start to strangle him the camera cuts away and shows us a close up of Phyllis instead. Her face has a shadow covering parts of it and she slowly begins to smirk. This shot is powerful and very telling on the kind of awful women Phyllis is. One last example of good editing in Double Indemnity is a scene towards the end, when Walter's boss begins to understand what he has been up to. His boss shows up at his apartment when Phyllis is there, so she ends up hiding behind his door and his boss is standing in the doorway. All that is separating the two from each other is the door, this causes a lot of tension and anxiety for the viewer. The shot is also very interesting in the fact that it has all three characters in this one frame, and it is a symbol for Walter's inner struggle, he literally has Phyllis on one side, and his boss and old life on the other.

282,3 October 2000,clive-38,10, One of Billy Wilder's best with outstanding cast.,"Although made in 1944 ""Double Indemnity"" still packs a punch today with its racy (for 1944) dialogue and fast moving plot. Definitely a 10/10.  The three leading players (Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson) have never been better and give powerful performances.  In my opinion Fred MacMurray should have won the Best Actor Oscar for his offbeat casting as Walter Neff, Billy Wilder deserved to win as Best Director and the film should have had Best Picture.  The three major awards that year all went to ""Going My Way"".  (Ironically, Billy Wilder won Best Director the following year for ""The Lost Weekend"" which also won Best Picture so that was some consolation for losing out with ""Double Indemnity"").  This is one of those films which can be enjoyed over and over again with repeated viewings - a ""film noir"" masterpiece.  ""Double Indemnity"" is the film that first made me aware of Billy Wilder as a director who then went on to make many other classic movies such as ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Ace in the Hole"" (also known as ""the Big Carnival""), ""Stalag 17"", ""Some Like It Hot"", ""The Apartment"" and several others.   Worthy of being in anyone's ""Top Ten"" list of the best films ever made! Clive Roberts.",

285,13 July 2014,l_rawjalaurence,10, Classic Film Noir,"Why is DOUBLE INDEMNITY such a great film? It has a lot to do with the performances: Fred MacMurray cast against type as Walter Neff, the insurance salesperson drawn into a web of intrigue, contrasted with Barbara Stanwyce, at once so alluring yet remarkably expressionless as she puts her plans into practice. And there is Edward G; Robinson as the fast-talking investigator, outwardly friendly yet with a mind like a steel trap. Billy Wilder's film is perfectly structured around a series of close-ups: the characters' expressions are perpetually put under the microscope so that every change in emotion is signaled to us. There is also the light, with the bars of the windows shining on MacMurray's face, emphasizing some kind of imprisonment; and Miklos Rozsa's haunting music, with its central motifs signifying doom. Yet perhaps this movie's greatest asset is its script: the story of how Wilder and Chandler's collaboration went through several problematic stages is a legendary one, but the end result is a taunt, literate piece of work, allowing the characters full rein to express themselves. MacMurray's voice-over leads us into the story, while emphasizing his guilty feelings for what he has done. There are also several humorous exchanges between MacMurray and Robinson; despite what he has done, it's clear that Robinson's investigator has a lasting respect for Neff as a person. There is also a running leitmotif throughout the film, as Neff keeps lighting the investigator's cigar with a match; the tables are only turned at the end, when the wounded Neff takes out a blood-stained cigarette and the investigator lights it for him. DOUBLE INDEMNITY is one of those films to watch again and again, not only because of the subtleties of structure and performance, but simply because it's a really good piece of work.",

The story is very effective the way it starts out basically at the end of the movie with the confession and having Neff narrating the story was a great idea and I can see now how it influences other filmmakers later because of how good it worked in this type of story. The characters are also great and Phyllis works really well, you start out liking Neff and Phyllis's relationship but towards the end she's the least liked character and the film does a great job developing them. Overall, Double Indemnity has a great story and characters that keep you sucked in this noir classic and gets an 8/10.",

289,18 November 2007,arthera09,9, fantastic,"It is really hard to older movies, because I am so young and they are not longer original or fresh. A lot of film techniques and plot devices have been used (poorly many times) in every movie seen. So the plot twists were not a huge surprise and the deviousness of the situations is not as shocking as it would have been if I grew up in that error. But besides all of that anyone can tell this is an outstanding movie and anyone that appreciates good dialog will love this movie. This movies has some of the quickest and sharp dialog that I have ever heard and was delivered in a way one just does not see anymore. I watched this with my room mate and he commented on how he would never kill for this girl, but I think an idea like that is lost through the ages and he cannot feel the electric draw of Phyllis's character as much as we might have if we grew up in a different generation. Besides that we have a performance with so many nuances that it is hard to catch them all. I think one of my favorite aspects of the character the female lead is she was able to outwit a very smooth talking salesmen who outwits people for a living with a blink of the eye at the very beginning with the dialog about speeding. If that does indicate that she is dangerous than I don't know does. But it is so quick that one may not realize that is the biggest clue that she can outwit all of them. The best part about Walter's character is that he is able to kill her at the end without a blink of the eye and he turns out to be just as evil as her in a way. As she opens up her heart to him he just shoots her. It is brilliant. No one gets the girl and there is not happy ending, but it is very satisfying to watch. The thing I would like to say about the director is that this is probably the best paced movie I have ever seen. It is extremely quick and only lets you breathe for a second and that is only when Walter gets to breathe. Consider there is so little action and it is mostly dialog this is quite a feat to pace it so well. I am glad I have seen this movie and would enjoy multiple viewings. But I think I can only give it a 9 because of the time frame.",

However, Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"" trumps all other entries in the genre, even the great ones like ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""M"". Based on James M. Cain's novel, the story follows insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), who enters his office one night bleeding from a bullet wound. Neff dictates his confession to his boss and friend Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). He describes his first encounter with Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), who convinces him to help her murder her husband for his life insurance. The inquisitive Keyes, however, is not ready to call Mr. Dietrichson's death accidental just yet, and soon enough Neff and Phyllis turn against each other, culminating in an unforgettable finish. The script is full of dialogue that is delivered in a humorous way (like Keyes's speech about suicide) by talented actors-the three leads are all terrific. MacMurray is the austere antihero present in just about all film noirs, but it's Stanwyck and Robinson that make the acting in this stand apart. As Phyllis, she starts off with an almost childlike innocence, but by the end has proved herself to be one of the most reprehensible of all characters in cinema history. Robinson provides comic relief as Keyes, but at the same time delivers several dramatic speeches. Billy Wilder does a terrific job with his direction, creating a milieu of darkness, the quintessential setting for a film noir. The murder scene in the car and the first encounter between Neff and Phyllis in Neff's apartment are two of the most conspicuous examples of Wilder's manipulation of light and darkness to engender the aforementioned ambiance. Miklos Rosza also provides a suspenseful score helping to capture the mood throughout. As a whole, ""Double Indemnity"" simply takes all of the necessary aspects for a film noir and accomplishes them , resulting in the greatest entry in one of Hollywood's best genres.",

This 1944 picture is one of the earlier film-noir films. It has all the elements: a weak man who succumbs to something bad, interesting lighting techniques/camera angles, and strong, villainous female characters. Interestingly enough, Wilder said he did not realize he was making a noir film when it was in production but rather making a film he would want to see. Timing just worked out perfectly. This is a great, tense thriller that is one of the best. Each character is fleshed out and has some dynamic lines of dialogue. The screenplay, written by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, contains vivacious dialogue and interesting situations. I note that I love how the writers focus on the relationship between the main character, Walter Neff and his insurance agent buddy, Walter Keyes.

Although the film was based on a novel, the film is told in flashbacks as a salesman falls for a mistress for which he becomes involved with murdering her husband and pretend if it he was killed in an accident. Barbara Stanwyck makes quite a beautiful impression while Fred MacMurray brilliantly portrays in a main dramatic role and Edward G. Robinson also joins in the mystery. There is lot of neatly-crafted camera-work and a memorable musical score to make it enough to be an instant masterpiece of the genre, and cannot ever forget to mention great mystery writer Raymond Chandler co-wrote the screenplay with Wilder as well. In other words overall, this is my new most favorite effort from Wilder after seeing some of his well-known works for over a decade now.",

Walter Neff's choices lead him to committing serious crimes and ultimately ruining his life. He grows wiser around the second culmination when he realizes he's made a mistake, however, his growth isn't deep enough for lasting change as shown when he tries to flee to Mexico. Another evidence that leads us to believe it's a Tragedy is that he never actually accomplishes his objectives. ""I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman."" He ultimately loses the fight and has minimal growth. Walter Neff is the main character because we experience the movie through him.

The film begins with Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), an insurance salesman who returns to his office building one night and begins to record a message for a colleague at his work, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). All we know from the start is that Walter has committed murder, we have no access to other details which gives the film a perfect setup to make the viewer be extremely curious as to what is going on. Afterwards, it begins to be told in flashback as Walter records his message which allows for narration that does not feel forced because well, he's recording a message. Right off the bat, I noticed how great the fast, snappy dialogue was as Walter meets and begins a conversation with Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). This fast dialogue is a huge advantage to the film because not only does it allow for smartly written lines and a well-paced film, it even allows for the occasional moment of comic relief because it never feels out of place.

This along with two interesting commentary tracks and an excellent documentary provides todays viewer with a great deal of insight into art of Billy Wilder. All of this is on disc one. It is disc two, with its sole offering of the 1973 made-for-television version that has brought criticism. Starring Richard Crenna, reprising the Fred MacMurray role, Samantha Eggar replacing Barbara Stanwyck and Lee J. Cobb instead of Edward G. Robinson, it uses a shortened version of the Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler screenplay to give us a 74 minute color edition of the 108 minute, black & white original. It would be interesting to take a group of university film students who have not seen either film and divide them up into two separate groups. Show half of them the original and the other group the TV version -- then have them each write their responses in a paper. Then let each group see the opposite version. It should make for a lively discussion. Why does the color in the TV version not work? Could color create the right mood? Does Miklos Rozsa's score have a positive impact on the original? The actors in the TV telling are speaking much of the same dialog found in the 1944 film -- why doesn't it have the same impact? What role does the director have in making the screenplay come to life? You get the idea. Comparing the two would bring home the point that it takes more then making a film by the numbers to come up with a memorable film experience. This special edition DVD is still a must own set!",

The scene of the crime is fascinating, with a short plane of the diabolically happy Cooper's face after sounding the claxon, and the elegance (Wilder) of not to show the murder explicitly, but only to suggest what is happening by this plane. If you have seen Garnet's The postman always rings twice, you're likely to prefer this one, although Garnet's movie may be very good.

I know now that film noir is not just detective movies, as Double Indemnity is a well-crafted thriller, and was surprised throughout most of the movie of how interesting the crime was. I thought of the crime in this movie like folding paper, where each layer matures or enhances the main characters' plan, sometimes with hidden words on the pages on the backsides that you will only learn about later when the page is unfolded. The reason the protagonist begins in this path didn't intrigue me too much, but after I saw how he planned and how he conducted his plans, I couldn't help but be sympathetic to his goals because he was so clever. The female lead's role was dull at first, but her character grows into a formattable force and becomes very interesting; she eventually became my favorite character, which I didn't think would happen, given less development as the protagonist. The secondary characters are all fleshed out and have reasons for being in the story; my favorite of these being Robinson's character. It had a solid ending to an amazing climax, and some great classic film noir moments too.

The already corrupt insurance industry is suddenly thrown into murder mystery that is driven by Phyllis' provocative mannerisms, desire wealth, a cold-heartedness.

Unfortunately, Walter works with a very clever investigator (Edward G. Robinson as Barton Keyes) whose ""Little Man"" and 20 plus years of experience, figures out the scheme. Because Neff and Keyes are friends, Keyes does not suspect Walter and it is not until Walter and Phyllis confront each other, with words and bullets, that Neff finally comes clean.

All of the actors do a great job at making their characters believable, especially Barbara Stanwyck, who did a really great job at making the audience hate how she could manipulate everyone around her. I would recommend this movie to people who like Crime/dramas and to people who enjoy a well put together complicated mystery.",
388,13 November 2020,c-hendron,8, Double Indemnity (1944),"Very few films can pull off revealing the killer at the very beginning, but Double Indemnity definitely does. Watching the story unfold and the truth being revealed throughout the film was an amazing experience. The story is gripping and the acting is quite notable. In particular, Barbara Stanwyck's performance was incredible, she made it so easy to hate her. The way she could manipulate everything and everyone around her was infuriating. This feels at times like a story about human nature above all else, and the extent people will go to for money. Overall, I can see why it is so beloved and highly reviewed. I would definitely recommend this film.",
389,30 May 2020,danielefanin-17409,9, Double Good!,"Should you need a movie to explain the concept of film noir, most likely Double Indemnity would be the preferred choice of many, also for defining the perfect dark lady, a Barbara Stanwyck in her more refined role, seductive without being attractive. But who said evil must be beautiful to be luring for the lost souls of the night?",
390,1 April 2021,TabithaNoel,8, A Great Film Noir Movie,"This film was really good; I thought the acting was good, the cinematography, the music, and how the story was told. This film's story is being told in a flashback not so far into the future which I think is a great idea for telling a story. Even though the film is in black and white, the picture is really crisp and clean looking. The music was really good, being suspenseful at the right times and doing a great job in making the viewer feel a certain way depending on what is going on in the film. I thought the acting was good; the actors managed to tell the audience what their characters were like by their interaction with other characters and their back stories.",
391,15 October 2006,wheelsdude,10, My 2nd Fav Noir,"I need to start by saying I love film noirs, probably more than almost any other film genre. Now I'm 19 I have just became a movie buff or movie freak in the last year or so, but I have come to love film noirs with a a passion. This movie is my 2nd favorite film noir, behind The Maltese Falcon. Now I just watched this one a few days ago, and I must say that it was suspenseful up to the end. Now this is a lot harder to do with this film, since they give the ending away at the beginning of the film, but it still manages to keep you intrigued to the end. The acting by both leads is superb, even though I thought it was a little annoying by the middle of the movie having to hear Fred MacMurray call Stanwyck ""baby"" every ten seconds. Stanwyck definitely deserved the Oscar nomination, but I think that MacMurray should have gotten at least a nod for the performance. The writing was excellent as well, as I said very suspenseful, and it makes me wonder just how much was taken from police reports or news stories from the crime in the late 20s that this story was supposedly based upon. Overall, I think that the story is what kept the movie flowing for me, and the performances just put it over the top. Kudos to Cain and Wilder though, superb script.",

It seemed like a crime plot, but it turned into an enjoyable guessing game of who will come out on top. Right from the start you know how it will end because Walter's tells you he got neither the money nor the girl, but the real fun of the film is in figuring out how it ends up being that way, because at some points he seems to be getting a clean break and then you remember how the film truly began. I definitely thought that Lola would have had a more prominent role, but she seemed almost like a distraction.",
397,8 May 2014,SaveFerris97,8, Perfect example of a film noir,"Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"" (1944) is dark and gripping; faultlessly summarizing what a classic film noir is expected to be.

The filmmakers used darkness terrifically to set the overall mood to the story and present a sense of mystery to the movie. Fred MacMurray's character, Walter Neff, gives the film a protagonist that is albe to be transformed from a straight and narrow person to one that falls down a darker path and the casting for the film was brilliant.",

Like all film noir genres it had the basic aspect necessary to make it a true film noir. It had the man that is tricked by the fem-fatal into killing for her and making sure that she was going to benefit greatly from it. Instead of a detective like some film noires the trick man was an insurance sales man on a routine call. The fem-fatal was his clients wife who seduces him within their first encounter and tricks him into believing she will be with him if he just helps get rid of her husband. The come up with the idea of taking a life insurance policy out on her husband and then faking his accidental death to get double the money on a ""Double Indemnity"" clause in the policy and it is here that the get the name for the movie. Unfortunately everything goes as planned except on person feels their is foul play and that is the insurance sales mans co worker. The wife in the end shoots the insurance sales man in an act of true betrayal.

The acting and story are both so mesmerizing, it's hard to say anything more than what's rightly been said about them already. Barbara Stanwyck makes the gas chamber seem a small price to pay, while Fred MacMurray pulls off the trick of making a loathsome character sympathetic to the audience. Edward G.

409,8 November 2019,kristjanbuckingham,8, Cigarette Dame-Dreams in Double Indemnity,"Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity encapsulates a significant period in cinema history that never quite existed in the real-world. There is a romantic element to film noir that allows it to have a shade of the surreal, while exploring the more diabolical side of human desire. As a staple of the genre, Double Indemnity takes the audience on a thrilling journey more relatable than they may care to admit.
When the sultry Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck, is visited by insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), she makes a proposition that begins their torrid affair and entangles the two in a lethal plot that is doomed from the start. Narrated as a dictation by Walter to his boss Keyes, played by Edward G. Robinson, the recorded confession signals to the audience from the beginning that things will not go according to plan. This reflective narration allows for Walter to call out his own foolishness in hindsight, and as the plan goes off without a hitch, adds to the intrigue of what will cause their downfall.
Film noir motifs are so particular and recognizable that it is difficult to pull off modern homages to the genre without coming off as cliché or ironic. What they may lack in authenticity to reality, films like Double Indemnity make up for in their earnest effort to portray scandalous characters that the audience can live through vicariously. At the time of the film's release in 1944, divorce would not be reformed for decades, so it was not only shameful, but also exceedingly difficult for married couples to legally separate. As a result, it is no wonder that fantasies of adultery or even spousal death would become morbidly appealing. Dames in need of rescuing from their despicable husbands by brooding life-long bachelors became the modern stories of damsels in distress; their tales shrouded in secrecy and paranoia of conspiracy.
The ambience of suspicion and mystery is accentuated by the moody dim lighting with harsh contrast and close-up camera angles; intimate shots of characters sparking matches to light each other's cigarettes. The lighting on set is often so dark and concentrated that blocking and shadow can be used to striking cinematic effect. Like this painterly approach to capturing the story on film, the way the actors converse is not meant to be entirely realistic, but rather a stylized representation that evokes a response from the audience. While actors may no longer take elocution lessons to learn how to speak correctly with the accent from nowhere, there is something alluring about the Transatlantic accent. Perhaps it's the allusively hard to place nature of the fabricated manner of speaking, or simply a nostalgia for old Hollywood, but it's those classic elements of film noir that make movies like Double Indemnity so seductive.",
410,6 August 2017,chloejfilmstudent,7, Superb!,"If you are a noir fan then this film is an absolute must see. The screenplay itself is a work of art in its character construction, plot structure and dialogue which is delivered by an ensemble of first class actors divying up first class performances. Barbra Stanwyck as the deadly, smouldering, scheming Phyllis Dietrichson turns in a performance that is right up there with Mary Astor's Brigid O'Shaughnessy. Fred McMurray delivers a performance of a smart but desperately lovelorn patsy and Edward G. Robinson is perfect in the role of Barton Keyes and just about steals the moment every time he appears on screen.",

415,11 July 2008,skpist,8, A classic that has aged well,"This 40's classic was actually unknown to me before I saw it a couple of years ago. But as a lover of good film noir, I must say that this movie must be one of the very best in that genre. The plot with the loving couple that mutually are driven to murdering the husband or wife of one of them has been copied and modified numerous times after this much praised movie, which was nominated for 7 Oscars (but oddly enough, it didn't win any of them). Not least during my youth in the 80's and 90's, we saw many variations of this theme with big stars in the leading roles. The stars of this original are Barbara Stanwyck as a very credible ""femme fatale"", and Edward G. Robinson as the experienced, highly intelligent investigator Keyes. The director Billy Wilder needs no further presentation, and his cooperation with the father of private eye Philip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler, really bore fruit in this exciting thriller. If you haven't seen this movie before, but if you saw ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"" (with Steve Martin, 1982), you will recognise the supermarket scene here. Fred MacMurray (Walter Neff) is almost forgotten today, but he acts well here; he reminds me a little both of Cary Grant and James Stewart here, to compare with more well-known Hollywood icons. Even 64 years after it was made, this film still feels fresh - Barbara Stanwyck really is sexy, the music is strong, and the cutting is professional. There are many other examples of film noir that are either too predictable and/or a bit too stylized, but ""Double Indemnity"" is a minor masterpiece still worth watching.",
416,4 July 2000,qprfan_scott,9, Classic Noir,"For someone born nearly forty years after this film to enjoy it, means it must be good. And it is. Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson are both brilliant in this film and the storyline is well written and well executed.",
417,25 July 2013,orenlashney-746-716262,9, The Height of Noir!,"Great film about crime and insurance claims. Ha ha ha. But most people don't know what double indemnity is even, so for this writer to fuse that in a detective thriller back then is pretty great. The acting is fantastic. Fred and Barbara are at the top of their game on this one. Actually, you don't even need to rent this. Buy it. It is definitely worth it to have in your film collection. Back in the day writers were so focused on great plot twists. This film has all that and more. It packs a great punch. Recommended to all film buffs. Also, the film is sexy in a way that dealt with a lot of implication instead of showing everything down and dirty. The environments are well shot, the lighting classic Noir, and the hard boiled detective genre is perfectly directed in this classic.",
418,15 December 2020,artfields,8, Good classic!,"Strongly adding to the effect of distorted time, like the film is too long for its own good is how it runs out of puff at just about 30 minutes before the end. All of the wit and plot strong points and crux of the film are dispensed through the first hour plus, and just when the momentum appears to be at a peak the film aggressively maintains a suspended effort of keeping that high note going on, and on, where it feels artificially kept alive and can't seem to make itself as interesting as the first two thirds. There's a natural rhythm and momentum for any film but these crime film-noirs especially and the intrigue needs to be carefully conducted and evenly spread over whichever period of time. It just feels dead and drags on at the end here, the last half hour rather painful and with little reward as there's a strong feeling of inevitability that something fairly predictable and just about how we'd imagine it is about to happen, the film strips its own self of any element of surprise and spontaneity and denies its viewer a punchy ending which is disappointing after demanding such focus from the audience.",
